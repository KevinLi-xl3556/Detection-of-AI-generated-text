In a recent and tragic incident in New York City, two pedestrians lost their lives after being hit by sanitation and concrete trucks. The incident has prompted an investigation and raised concerns about the safety of pedestrians in the city.

According to the New York Times, the first accident occurred in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights. A 10-year-old boy was crossing a street with his family when he was struck by a sanitation truck. The boy was rushed to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after.

The second accident occurred in the neighboring borough of Queens. A woman in her 60s was hit by a concrete truck while crossing a street. She too was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.

The incidents have sparked renewed concerns about the safety of pedestrians in New York City, particularly in light of the recent increase in truck traffic due to the ongoing construction boom. According to data from the New York Police Department, there were 111 pedestrian fatalities in the city in 2019, with trucks involved in 32 of those deaths.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city officials have called for measures to improve pedestrian safety, such as stronger regulations on truck traffic and stricter enforcement of traffic laws. However, critics say that more needs to be done, including greater investment in pedestrian infrastructure and more rigorous driver training.

The tragedies serve as a reminder that pedestrians continue to be vulnerable in cities like New York, where traffic congestion and construction are a part of daily life. In order to prevent further tragedies, it is essential that city officials and other stakeholders work together to find effective solutions that prioritize pedestrian safety.
