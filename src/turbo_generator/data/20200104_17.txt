As Generation Z continues to enter adulthood and become more politically active, the right-wing movement has recognized the need to appeal to this demographic. With the rise of social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, right-wing influencers have taken to these platforms to spread their message to Gen Z.

Taking a page out of the left-wing playbook, these influencers are using short-form videos, averaging five minutes in length, to spread their message of conservatism. This approach allows for quick and easy consumption, perfect for a generation that has grown up with short attention spans and instant gratification.

These influencers present a unique challenge to the left, as they are able to present their views in a more digestible way to Gen Z. By using humor, memes, and relatable content, these influencers are able to capture the attention of young adults who are more likely to scroll past a lengthy article or news segment.

One of the most popular right-wing influencers on TikTok is conservative commentator and comedian Sydney Watson. With over one million followers and counting, Watson's videos tackle a range of topics from cancel culture to gun rights. Her clever use of humor and relatable anecdotes has made her a recognizable figure among right-wing Gen Zers.

Another influential figure in the right-wing movement's social media strategy is Benny Johnson, known for his work with conservative media outlets like The Daily Caller and Turning Point USA. With nearly 1.5 million followers on Instagram, Johnson uses short-form videos to present his conservative views in a witty and engaging manner.

These right-wing influencers are not only gaining traction among Gen Z, but they are also challenging traditional conservative media outlets. As younger generations continue to turn away from cable news and traditional print media, these influencers represent a shift in the way political messaging is disseminated.

While the rise of right-wing influencers may be cause for concern for those on the left, it is important to note that this is not a new phenomenon. Left-wing influencers have been using similar tactics for years, and the rise of right-wing influencers can be seen as a natural response to a changing political landscape.

The question remains: will this approach be successful in swaying Gen Z towards conservative ideals? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: right-wing influencers are not going anywhere anytime soon. They have tapped into a market that traditional conservative media outlets have failed to reach, and their influence will only continue to grow as Gen Z becomes more politically active.
