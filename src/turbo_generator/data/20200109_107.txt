On December 18th, 2019, House Democrats voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. However, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has not yet sent these articles to the Senate for trial, citing concerns about fairness and impartiality in the Senate proceedings.

Some have criticized Pelosi for holding onto the articles, arguing that they should be sent to the Senate immediately in order to keep the impeachment process moving forward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has even accused Pelosi of playing political games and suggested that she is afraid to present the evidence against Trump in a trial.

However, Pelosi has defended her decision, stating that she wants to ensure a fair trial in the Senate. She has expressed concerns about McConnell’s stated intention to coordinate with the White House during the trial, and has called on the Senate to provide more details about the trial procedures before sending over the articles of impeachment.

Pelosi has also argued that the delay in sending over the articles has put pressure on Senate Republicans to consider calling witnesses and obtaining new evidence in the trial. Some Republican senators, including Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, have already expressed openness to calling witnesses, and the delay in sending over the articles may encourage more Republicans to do so.

Ultimately, Pelosi’s decision to hold onto the articles of impeachment highlights the deep divisions and political gamesmanship at play in the impeachment process. While some believe that impeachment is necessary to hold the president accountable for his actions, others see it as a politically motivated attack on Trump.

As the Senate prepares for a trial, Pelosi’s actions will continue to be closely watched. Only time will tell if her strategy of delaying the articles of impeachment will pay off, or if it will ultimately boomerang back against her and the Democratic Party.
