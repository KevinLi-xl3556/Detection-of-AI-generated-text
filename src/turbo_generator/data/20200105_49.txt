On January 5th, 2020, three American soldiers died in an attack on a Kenyan military base by the Islamist extremist group, al-Shabab. The attack on the Manda Bay Airfield, located on the coastal region of Kenya, caused significant damage to the base and resulted in the deaths of three Americans and several Kenyan military personnel.

The Americans killed in the attack were identified as U.S. Army Specialist Henry Mayfield Jr., U.S. Army Sergeant First Class Dustin Ard, and U.S. Army Private First Class Brandon Jay Kreischer. All three were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 58th Aviation Regiment, 164th Theater Airfield Operations Group, based in Fort Rucker, Alabama.

Kenyan officials reported that the attackers infiltrated the base through a small, well-concealed breach in its perimeter fence. Following the attack, the Islamist extremist group claimed responsibility for the act, calling it a “vengeful raid” against the United States and Kenya’s military presence in Somalia.

The attack marks the first time U.S. service members have been killed in Kenya by the al-Qaeda affiliate group since the year 2016. While U.S. forces in the region are primarily supporting local forces engaged in counter-terrorism operations, the attack highlights the continued threat posed by extremists in the region.

The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) stated in a press release that the U.S. military is committed to working closely with Kenyan authorities to investigate the incident fully. The statement also emphasized the importance of international partners working together to fight against extremism and terrorism.

In recent years, al-Shabab has been responsible for a series of devastating attacks in Kenya, including the 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping center in Nairobi that killed 67 people and a 2015 attack on Garissa University College in northeastern Kenya that killed 148 people.

The attack on Manda Bay Airfield serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges faced by international security forces in combating the spread of extremist ideology and terrorism. As the region continues to face such threats, it is crucial for global partners to work hand-in-hand to prevent similar attacks and preserve peace and security.
