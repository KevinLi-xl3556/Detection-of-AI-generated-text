The plight of being born second is a subject that has been a matter of debate for many years. While the eldest child is always given preferential treatment, the second one has to suffer the consequences of being born second. Being born second is a unique and distinct experience that brings with it a variety of challenges that are often overlooked. 

For starters, the second child is always compared to the first child. The firstborn is looked up to as a role model and an example of how things should be done. In contrast, the second child is expected to follow in their footsteps and meet the same standards. This constant comparison can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Another challenge that comes with being born second is the lack of attention from parents. The first child always receives the majority of the love and attention, leaving the second child to fend for themselves. This can create feelings of neglect and abandonment, which can affect the emotional and mental well-being of the child.

Additionally, the second child is often left out of decisions that concern the family. The first child’s needs and wants are always given priority, leaving the second child feeling ignored and unimportant. This can lead to feelings of frustration and resentment towards the family as a whole.

Furthermore, the second child is always in a constant state of competition with the first child. They are always trying to catch up and prove themselves, which can lead to a sense of rivalry between siblings. This can create a rift between siblings that can last well into adulthood.

In conclusion, the plight of being born second is a real and challenging experience. It is important for parents to recognize the unique challenges and struggles that come with being born second and to provide support and guidance to help their child navigate through it. Parents must celebrate each child’s uniqueness and stop making unnecessary comparisons between their children. Only then can we ensure that all children receive the love and attention they deserve.
