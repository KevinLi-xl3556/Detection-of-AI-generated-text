On December 29, 2019, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon in a daring escape that left authorities puzzled and embarrassed. Now, months after the incident, Turkey has announced that it is questioning seven people, including four pilots, about their roles in the mission.

The news was reported by The New York Times on July 3, 2020, and is the latest development in a saga that has captivated the world. Ghosn, who was facing charges of financial misconduct in Japan, had been held under house arrest and was awaiting trial when he made his escape. He allegedly fled by hiding in a large musical instrument case and slipping past airport security with the help of accomplices.

Turkey, where Ghosn made a stopover on his way to Lebanon, has become a key focus of the investigation into how he was able to evade authorities. According to sources who spoke to The New York Times, Turkish officials are now questioning pilots who were involved in transporting Ghosn from Japan to Turkey, as well as those who facilitated his onward journey.

The identity of the seven people being questioned has not been released, but they are believed to include pilots from two private jet companies that were used to transport Ghosn. Turkish authorities are reportedly seeking to determine whether any laws were broken during the operation, and whether any individuals involved should face charges.

The revelations are sure to add new intrigue to the already dramatic tale of Carlos Ghosn’s escape. Since his arrival in Lebanon, Ghosn has been openly critical of the Japanese justice system, and has accused the country of suppressing evidence and denying him a fair trial. He has also been quoted as saying that he will not return to Japan to face his accusers, stating that he has “escaped injustice.”

The Japanese authorities, for their part, have not let the matter drop. They have sought Ghosn’s extradition from Lebanon, and have issued arrest warrants for several individuals who are believed to have assisted with his escape. However, the chances of extraditing the former CEO seem slim, as Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan.

As the investigation into Ghosn’s escape continues, it remains to be seen what further revelations will emerge. However, it is clear that the saga has already left a lasting impression on the world, and has raised questions about the limits of executive power and the capabilities of national justice systems. With Turkey’s announcement that it is questioning pilots over their roles in the operation, the story promises to remain in the headlines for some time to come.
