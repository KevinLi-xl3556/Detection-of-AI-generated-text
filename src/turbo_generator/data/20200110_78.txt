In his new play, "Queens Row," Richard Maxwell explores the aftermath of a doomsday event on a small community in rural Arkansas. The play, which premiered at the Abrons Arts Center in New York City, offers a sobering look at life in the wake of tragedy, as well as a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit. 

The play centres around a group of six survivors who have taken refuge in an abandoned house in the hills outside of town. They pass their days in a gentle rhythm of gardening, cooking, and caring for the animals they've taken in. They also engage in philosophical discussions about the nature of life, death, and what comes after. These conversations are meditative and thought-provoking, reminding the audience of the larger themes at play.

The cast of "Queens Row" is made up of actors who have worked closely with Maxwell over the years, and it shows. The chemistry between them is palpable, and the performances are deeply felt. Joe Veronis, as the group's nominal leader, brings a quiet strength and a sense of hopefulness to his role. Rebecca Michelson, as the group's spiritual guide, imbues her character with a sense of calm and wisdom. And Jim Fletcher, as the group's resident philosopher, delivers his lines with a dry wit that earns some of the play's biggest laughs.

Maxwell's direction is spare and precise, with the focus squarely on the characters and their relationships. He eschews typical theatrical conventions, such as lighting cues and music, in favour of a more naturalistic approach. This serves to heighten the sense of intimacy between the characters and the audience, as if we're eavesdropping on their conversations.

At its core, "Queens Row" is a play about the human capacity for survival and the ways in which we cope with loss. In the face of adversity, the characters find solace in their community and each other. They cling to what little they have left in order to find meaning and purpose in a world that's been turned upside down. 

But the play doesn't suggest that this is easy. There are moments of grief and anger, of despair and hopelessness. Maxwell doesn't shy away from the darker emotions, but he also refuses to wallow in them. Instead, he infuses the play with a sense of optimism, even as the characters confront the enormity of their situation.

"Queens Row" is a beautiful, haunting play that lingers in the mind long after the final curtain. It's a testament to the power of theatre to explore the human condition with honesty and compassion. And it's a reminder that, even in the darkest of times, there is still beauty and meaning to be found.
