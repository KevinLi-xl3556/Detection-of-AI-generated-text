A recent court decision has allowed a lawsuit against Artforum to move forward, though claims specifically naming the publisher have been dismissed.

The lawsuit, filed by Amanda Schmitt, a former employee of the magazine, alleges that former publisher Knight Landesman had subjected her to sexual harassment and discrimination. Schmitt’s lawsuit also named Artforum itself as a defendant, claiming that the magazine enabled Landesman’s behavior by not doing enough to prevent it.

In the ruling, Judge Gregory H. Woods allowed claims against Artforum to proceed, stating that Schmitt had “sufficiently pled that Artforum ‘ratified’ Landesman’s conduct by failing to act on her complaints of his harassment.”

However, claims specifically targeting Artforum’s publisher were dismissed. The judge wrote that Schmitt had not provided sufficient evidence that the publisher was personally responsible for the harassment and discrimination she faced.

This ruling comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has highlighted the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in many industries, including the art world. The lawsuit against Artforum serves as a reminder that even prestigious and established institutions are not immune to such behavior.

Schmitt’s lawsuit also highlights the responsibility that organizations have in properly addressing and preventing such behavior. By allowing claims against Artforum to proceed, the court has indicated that more needs to be done to hold organizations accountable for enabling harassment and discrimination.

The ruling also underscores the importance of creating safe and inclusive workplaces. While the dismissal of claims against the publisher may be seen as a setback, the fact that the lawsuit can proceed against Artforum itself means that accountability can still be pursued.

Ultimately, the decision sends a message that those who experience harassment and discrimination in the workplace have legal recourse, and that organizations must take active steps to prevent such behavior from occurring in the first place.
