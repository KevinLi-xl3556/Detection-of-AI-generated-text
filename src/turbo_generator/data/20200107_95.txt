In 2020, California has implemented a series of new laws affecting everything from homelessness to the gig economy. These changes have been a long time coming, with lawmakers and activists pushing for reform in various areas for years. 

One of the most significant pieces of legislation is AB5, which clarifies the classification of independent contractors. Up until now, companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have classified their drivers as independent contractors, which exempts them from certain labor laws and benefits. AB5 reclassifies these drivers as employees, meaning they are now entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay, and other benefits. This shift marks a major victory for gig workers and labor advocates, who have been fighting to protect the rights of an increasingly large portion of the workforce. 

Other new laws address the state's ongoing homelessness crisis. SB450 requires local governments to create plans to distribute surplus land for affordable housing, while AB1188 allows local governments to establish safe parking programs for individuals living in their cars. Additionally, AB1708 establishes a statewide hotline for homeless individuals seeking services, and SB329 prohibits landlords from discriminating against renters who receive government assistance, such as Section 8 vouchers. 

Gun control was also an issue in 2020. AB61 provides a mechanism for employers, coworkers, and educators to seek gun violence restraining orders against individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others, while SB61 expands the existing red flag law to temporarily remove guns from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others. Additionally, AB893 prohibits the sale of ammunition at gun shows held at the Cow Palace in Daly City, CA. 

Finally, California has taken steps to combat the growing climate crisis. SB200 sets a goal for achieving safe and affordable drinking water for all Californians, while AB1266 establishes a framework for local communities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of community choice energy programs. AB1395 aims to reduce plastic waste by requiring manufacturers of plastic products to use a minimum percentage of recycled materials in their products. 

While these new laws are a positive step forward for the state, they are not without controversy. AB5 has faced pushback from companies in the gig economy, who argue that it will result in higher prices for consumers and reduced flexibility for workers. Similarly, some gun rights advocates argue that expanded red flag laws infringe on Second Amendment rights. Nevertheless, California's leaders believe these policies are necessary to address some of the state's most pressing issues. 

In summary, new 2020 California laws show the state's commitment to progressive values and serve as examples for other states to follow. Its policies on independent contractors, homelessness, gun control, and the environment reflect the concerns of its citizens, and address some of California's most pressing issues.  Overall, these laws demonstrate that California is leading the way in progressive legislation and prioritizing the well-being of its residents.
