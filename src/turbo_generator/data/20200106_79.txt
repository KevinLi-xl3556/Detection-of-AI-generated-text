Where Eagle Feathers Fall Like Snow

The eagle has always held a special place in the hearts of native peoples across North America, including those of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. It is a revered symbol, representing strength, power, and freedom. For the Haudenosaunee, the eagle feather is particularly sacred, and its significance is reflected in many of their traditions and ceremonies.

However, obtaining eagle feathers is not an easy task. Hunting eagles or disturbing their nests is strictly prohibited by federal law, and possession or sale of eagle feathers is also illegal without a permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Despite these regulations, Native Americans are allowed to possess eagle feathers for religious and cultural purposes.

One of the most unusual ways that eagle feathers have been obtained and used is at the annual Lacrosse Face-Off, a match between the Haudenosaunee Nationals and the US Men’s National Lacrosse Team. The game is a symbol of reconciliation and friendship between the two nations, and an opportunity for players and spectators alike to learn and connect with traditional Haudenosaunee culture.

The face-off is held at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, NY, which is situated on indigenous lands. Prior to the game, a special ceremony called the Opening Prayer and Eagle Dance is held, during which an eagle feather is sent soaring into the sky. It is said that where the feather falls, it blesses the land and the people who inhabit it.

This tradition began in 1990 when Oren Lyons, a traditional leader of the Onondaga Nation and a former professional lacrosse player, approached the US Lacrosse governing body with an idea to establish a formal relationship between the US lacrosse team and the Haudenosaunee Nationals. The face-off was created as a way to deepen ties and promote indigenous peoples’ interests in the sport of lacrosse.

Since then, the Lacrosse Face-Off has become an important event that brings together members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the broader community. It is a reminder of the many contributions that Native peoples have made in shaping the culture, traditions, and identity of the United States.

The eagle feather remains a powerful symbol of that connection. As it falls like snow, it brings with it a spirit of hope, healing, and unity that transcends the boundaries of race, ethnicity, and culture. It is a reminder that we are all connected, and that we must work together to create a more just and equitable future for all people.

In closing, the Lacrosse Face-Off is an event that represents the best of what sports can be: a way to celebrate diversity, promote understanding, and bridge divides. It is a place where eagle feathers fall like snow, reminding us of the beauty, resilience, and sacredness of indigenous cultures, and inspiring us to build a better world for generations to come.
