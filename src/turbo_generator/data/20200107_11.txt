The assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani by the United States in January of 2020 sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East and the world. While many have speculated on the motivations and consequences of the killing, one person in particular has been singled out as the driving force behind it: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Pompeo, a former congressman from Kansas and an avowed hardliner on Iran, has been a vocal advocate for aggressive action against the Islamic Republic for many years. As Secretary of State under President Trump, he has been at the forefront of efforts to increase pressure on Iran through sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and military threats.

But it was his role in persuading Trump to order the killing of Soleimani that has earned him particular notoriety. According to numerous reports, Pompeo was a key architect of the operation, which was carried out at Baghdad International Airport by a US drone strike.

Pompeo's push to take out Soleimani was reportedly motivated by a desire to weaken Iran's influence in the region and to send a message of strength to Tehran. He believed that killing Soleimani, who was one of the most powerful figures in the Iranian government and a key architect of its regional strategy, would deal a major blow to the regime's ability to project power.

Critics, however, argue that Pompeo's actions have had the opposite effect. The killing of Soleimani has sparked a new round of violence and instability in the Middle East, and many experts warn that it could lead to a wider conflict between the US and Iran. The region has already seen a surge in attacks by Iranian-backed militias against US forces in Iraq, and tensions between Washington and Tehran remain high.

Moreover, Pompeo's aggressive stance on Iran has alienated many of America's traditional allies in the region, who fear that the US is pursuing a reckless and counterproductive strategy. Saudi Arabia, for example, has expressed concern that Pompeo's focus on Iran is distracting from more pressing regional issues, such as the civil war in Yemen and the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.

Despite these criticisms, Pompeo shows no signs of backing down. He continues to push for harsher sanctions against Iran and has been a vocal advocate for increased military cooperation between the US and its Gulf allies. He also insists that the US remains committed to diplomacy with Iran, even as many experts warn that the chances for a negotiated settlement are dwindling.

For better or for worse, Pompeo's actions have upended the Middle East and sparked a new round of tensions and instability in the region. Whether he will ultimately be judged as a visionary strategist or a reckless ideologue remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: his influence on US policy toward Iran will continue to be felt for years to come.
