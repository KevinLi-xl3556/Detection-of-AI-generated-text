As an Army officer, I have been trained to protect and serve our country with honor and dignity. However, a few days ago, my mother was deported, and it was completely inhumane.

My mother had been living in this country for over 20 years. She has been a law-abiding citizen with no criminal record, and she has been working hard to provide for our family. But due to the immigration system's flaws, my mother was deported back to a country she hasn't been in for over two decades.

The process leading to my mother's deportation was disheartening. She was detained by ICE for no valid reason, and after a few weeks of hiding behind bureaucracy, they finally deported her. The government didn't take into consideration the fact that my mother is a vital member of our community. She raised upstanding citizens, who are now contributing significantly to this country.

The United States has always been looked up to as a country of immigrants, where every person is welcome, regardless of their background. However, with recent events like these deportations, it seems like our country has lost its sense of humanity. Deporting immigrants without reasonable cause, completely disregarding their contributions to society, and separating families is categorically wrong.

As military officers, we are trained to protect the country's interests and, more importantly, our people. Deporting law-abiding citizens, tearing families apart, and leaving children behind is entirely against our duties as protectors of the nation.

The present situation is alarming, and it's time for the government to take action to address the flawed immigration system. The system should protect immigrants' rights while at the same time ensuring a rigorous vetting process to identify non-law-abiding immigrants. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents should exercise discretion in their work to prevent unjust deportations, such as that of my mother.

As an Army officer, I hope my mother's deportation will serve as a wake-up call for our nation. We must never forget the values and principles our country was founded on. We must work to restore our sense of humanity and treat immigrants with respect, dignity, and humanity.
