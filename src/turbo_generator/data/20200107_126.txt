Nicky Haslam’s House of Commons: The New York Times

Nicky Haslam, the renowned British interior designer, has made headlines recently for his latest project — the "House of Commons" apartment in London. Featured in The New York Times, the apartment has earned praise for its unique look inspired by the historic British parliament building.

Designed to reflect a sense of grandeur and political gravitas, the House of Commons draws inspiration from the centuries-old Palace of Westminster. Throughout the space, ornate moldings and paneling recall the opulence of the parliamentary chambers.

Haslam has approached the project with a keen sense of history and an eye for detail, taking care to incorporate authentic period pieces throughout the space. The result is a blend of old world charm and modern aesthetics that feels both reverent and fresh.

The apartment's design is not only impressive for its elegance but it also showcases an element of playfulness throughout. The living room features a bright pink rug with a pattern of dartboards, while a painting of Queen Elizabeth II in full regalia gazes down from above the fireplace. The space channels a creative energy that is both intrepid and entertaining.

In keeping with the theme, Haslam has incorporated antique furnishings, such as a gilded chandelier and a leather Chesterfield sofa, alongside more contemporary elements like sleek lighting fixtures and handcrafted wallpaper. Perhaps most striking of all, the House of Commons also features a full-sized replica of the iconic Big Ben tower, complete with its signature clock face.

The House of Commons has received a warm welcome from the design community and media alike. Its unique style and blend of historical and modern elements make it a go-to destination for both visitors and London residents.

Nicky Haslam has certainly outdone himself with this latest creation, and the House of Commons proves that his expertise in interior design is unparalleled. The space wears its British heritage proudly, while also capturing the spirit of playful sophistication that permeates its design.

As the Houses of Parliament in Westminster undergoes its own extensive renovation, it’s comforting to know that this new addition to the design scene will continue to serve as a timeless inspired ode to the British parliamentary institution.
