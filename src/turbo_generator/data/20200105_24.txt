As someone who knows his way around bankruptcy court, Donald Trump has often boasted about his ability to manage debt. Throughout his career as a real estate developer and later as a reality television star, he has acquired and leveraged massive amounts of debt to fund his ventures. Now, as president, he has once again become the “King of Debt” — but at what cost?

Since his inauguration, President Trump has overseen an exponential increase in the national debt, which currently stands at over $22 trillion. Despite his promises to reduce the deficit and balance the budget, his administration’s policies have only added to the nation’s financial burden. Under the guise of stimulating economic growth, Trump’s tax reform bill has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, while also increasing the federal deficit by nearly $1.5 trillion.

In addition to tax reform, the Trump administration’s trade policies have also contributed to the rising debt. The ongoing trade war with China has not only hurt American businesses and consumers, but it has also led to increased government spending on farm subsidies and other aid programs to offset the financial damage.

Meanwhile, Trump’s proposed budget cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps only exacerbate the financial strain on vulnerable Americans. By reducing or eliminating these programs, the administration hopes to save money in the short-term, but at the expense of millions of citizens who rely on them for basic necessities like healthcare and food.

As the national debt continues to balloon out of control, the consequences may not manifest themselves for several years to come. But make no mistake — the impact will be felt by future generations who will bear the brunt of this fiscal irresponsibility.

The “King of Debt” may have been successful in his personal business ventures by leveraging and re-leveraging debt, but the same cannot be said for our nation’s economy. As president, Trump has a responsibility to prioritize the best interests of the American people, not his own bottom line. Let us hope that he begins to understand the long-term consequences of his actions, and takes action to reduce the deficit and secure the financial future of our country.
