On November 19, 2019, the New York Times reported that the Lebanese government has ordered former Nissan Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, to stay in Lebanon after his escape from Japan. Lebanese authorities issued a travel ban against Ghosn, who has been accused of financial misconduct during his tenure at Nissan.

This development comes after Ghosn's dramatic escape from Japan, where he was awaiting trial on charges related to his alleged financial misconduct. Ghosn had been placed under strict surveillance and was prohibited from leaving Japan pending trial. However, he managed to flee the country to Lebanon via Turkey, reportedly hidden in a large box normally used for musical instruments.

Ghosn's escape has caused a great deal of controversy and has put a spotlight on Japan's legal system. Many have criticized the bail system in Japan that allows for extended detentions and limited access to legal representation. Ghosn has maintained his innocence and has accused Nissan and Japanese officials of conspiring against him to prevent his plans of further integrating Nissan and Renault.

Lebanon has traditionally been a safe haven for Ghosn, who holds Lebanese, French, and Brazilian citizenship. The former Nissan Chairman has a strong connection to Lebanon, as he spent much of his childhood and adolescence there. It is believed that Ghosn is planning to fight his charges from Lebanon, where he will have more freedom to conduct his defense.

The Lebanese government's decision to ban Ghosn's travel and order him to stay put puts a further spotlight on the international intrigue surrounding his case. While Ghosn's escape may have provided him with a temporary reprieve from his legal troubles, it is clear that the issues stemming from his time at Nissan are far from over, and the world will be closely watching as the situation unfolds.
