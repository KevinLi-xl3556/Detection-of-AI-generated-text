In a Homecoming Video Meant to Unite Campus, Almost Everyone Was White

A homecoming video at the University of South Carolina (USC) has sparked criticism and controversy for its apparent lack of diversity. The video, which was released on September 17, features a montage of scenes from the campus and the city of Columbia, set to an uplifting soundtrack and the slogan "Welcome Home, Gamecocks!" However, many viewers noticed that the vast majority of people in the video were white, leading to accusations of exclusion and insensitivity.

The New York Times reported on the backlash that the video received on social media and on campus. Some students and alumni expressed disappointment and frustration that a video meant to represent the entire USC community failed to reflect its racial and ethnic diversity. Others criticized the university's marketing department for perpetuating a narrow and outdated image of who belongs at USC and who counts as a Gamecock, the mascot of the university's sports teams.

According to the Times, USC has responded to the criticism by issuing a statement that acknowledges and regrets the video's shortcomings. The statement, attributed to Wes Hickman, the executive director of the university's alumni association, says that "as a team, we fell short of our goal to showcase the inclusivity of the Carolina family." Hickman also promised to work with students and staff on improving the representation and perception of diversity at USC.

However, some students and faculty have called for more concrete actions and changes, such as hiring more staff of color, increasing the funding for multicultural programs and initiatives, and addressing systemic racism and discrimination on campus. They argue that diversity and inclusion are not just buzzwords or optional extras, but essential components of a vibrant and equitable community that values all its members and their backgrounds and experiences.

The incident at USC is not unique, unfortunately. Similar cases of homogeneity and exclusion have occurred at other universities and organizations, where diversity is often treated as a problem or a luxury, instead of a necessity and a strength. These incidents reveal the ongoing challenges and opportunities of creating truly inclusive and equitable spaces, where everyone can feel welcome and respected, regardless of their skin color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any other aspect of their identity.

As the Times article notes, "the controversy over USC's video should serve as a reminder of the importance of representation and the dangers of complacency." Universities, like other institutions, have a responsibility and a potential to foster diversity and inclusion, but this requires intentional and sustained efforts to confront and address the historical and current injustices and biases that shape our society. Homecoming videos, and other forms of communication and outreach, can either reinforce or challenge those biases and injustices. The choice is ours.
