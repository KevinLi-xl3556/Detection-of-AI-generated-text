London fashion week is known for its avant-garde runway shows and edgy street style, but this year's fashion week saw a new trend emerging: Cheetos tans and codpieces.

The Cheetos tan trend has been making waves on social media for a while now, but it seems that London designers are finally embracing it. From oversized blazers to sheer dresses, models were sporting the orange-tinted look on the runway. But it's not just limited to clothing â€“ makeup artists have also been experimenting with the trend by using orange and yellow hues to give models a Cheetos-inspired glow.

Another surprising trend that made an appearance at the fashion week was the codpiece. Originally worn by men in the 16th century to accentuate their masculinity, the codpiece has been making a comeback in recent years, and London designers have fully embraced it this season. From leather to metallic finishes, the codpiece was seen paired with everything from jumpsuits to skirts, giving a futuristic twist to the historic accessory.

But not everyone is on board with these new trends. Some critics have called them ridiculous and impractical, while others have accused designers of trying too hard to be edgy and outrageous. However, for those who embrace individuality and creativity, these trends offer a refreshing break from tradition and predictability.

Fashion has always been a form of expression, and London fashion week proved that once again this year. Whether it's a bold statement piece or a subtle nod to a retro trend, fashion allows us to say something about ourselves and the times we live in. So, whether you're a fan of the Cheetos tan or the codpiece, let us celebrate the diversity and originality that fashion has to offer.
