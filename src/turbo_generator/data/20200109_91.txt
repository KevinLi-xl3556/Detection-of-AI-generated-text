In a shocking turn of events, the leadership of the Romance Writers of America has resigned from their positions, as reported by The New York Times. This announcement comes after weeks of turmoil and criticism, with members and authors alike calling for change within the organization.

The controversy began when it was discovered that a book with racist content had been nominated for a prestigious award by the RWA. This sparked outrage from members of the organization, prompting the RWA to initially defend the nomination. This response was met with even more backlash and led to authors withdrawing their membership.

The fallout continued when a member of the RWA's ethics committee was suspended and subsequently resigned from her position due to her handling of the situation. This prompted more members to speak out about the lack of diversity and inclusion within the RWA.

In response to the growing criticism, the RWA leadership proposed changes to their bylaws, including the addition of a diversity and inclusion committee. However, members felt that these changes were not enough and continued to call for further action.

The resignation of the RWA leadership is a dramatic step towards addressing the issues within the organization. It remains to be seen how this will impact the RWA and the romance writing community as a whole. However, it is clear that there is a need for greater diversity and inclusion in leadership and representation in the industry.

As romance writers, we have a responsibility to create stories that reflect the diverse world we live in. It is also the responsibility of the organizations that represent us to ensure that they are inclusive and supportive of all members. The events surrounding the RWA have been a wake-up call for the industry, and a reminder that we can and must do better.
