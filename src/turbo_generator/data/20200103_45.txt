Method to the Madness: Peter Mattei on Becoming Wozzeck

According to Mattei, playing the role of Wozzeck requires a deep understanding and empathy towards the complexities of the character. Wozzeck is a soldier who is constantly demoralized by his superiors and ridiculed by his peers. He is also battling with his own inner demons, struggling to find meaning and purpose in his life.

To prepare for the role, Mattei plunged into the depths of his character's psyche by reading poetry, watching documentaries, and observing real-life people who have had similar experiences as Wozzeck. He also worked extensively with the director, Sir David McVicar, to develop a clear arc for his character and to inhabit Wozzeck's world in a very physical way.

For Mattei, the key to becoming Wozzeck was to fully immerse himself in the character's emotional journey. He spent hours rehearsing each scene, trying out different approaches, and experimenting with various vocal techniques. He even changed his diet and exercise regimen to become more physically attuned to the character's movements and vocal requirements.

Ultimately, Mattei's hard work and commitment to his craft paid off, as he received widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal of Wozzeck in the Metropolitan Opera's recent production of the opera. His performance was praised for its raw intensity, emotional depth, and vocal prowess.

In conclusion, Peter Mattei's journey to becoming Wozzeck is a testament to the power of method acting and dedication to one's craft. His ability to fully embody and bring to life such a complex and tragic character is a true testament to his talent and commitment to opera. As audiences continue to marvel at his performances, it is clear that Mattei is a true master of his craft and a true gift to the world of opera.
