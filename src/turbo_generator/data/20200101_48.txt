Pika-Who? How Pokémon Go Confused the Canadian Military 

The popular mobile game, Pokémon Go has been taking the world by storm since its release in 2016. The game, which encourages users to explore their surroundings in search of fictional creatures, has become an international phenomenon. However, while enthusiasts have been promoting the benefits of the game, the Canadian military found itself struggling with the consequences.

For those not playing the game, Pokémon Go may seem trivial or even frivolous. But for those who do play it, the game can be all-consuming. And this is what happened in Canada in 2016, when Canadian military personnel were unexpectedly caught up in the game hype. Canadian troops were seen wandering around military bases during their off hours, often staring intensely into their phones and apparently oblivious to their surroundings. This behavior understandably raised some eyebrows among higher-ups, and some military personnel were reprimanded.

At the time, the Canadian military was concerned that the game could be used by foreign intelligence agencies to gather information on military operations. There were also concerns that the game could jeopardize military equipment, as players were known to bump into objects while playing the game.

The Canadian military responded by launching a campaign to educate soldiers about the dangers associated with Pokémon Go, and started issuing warnings to its members. Soldiers were advised to be wary of "Pikachu hiding behind the sandbags." In the end, the issue was handled promptly and with efficiency, and the Canadian military managed to avoid any significant security issues.

Looking back, the “Pokémon Go crisis” appears to have been something of a fluke, a momentary lapse in judgment that was eventually overcome. However, the incident highlights the potential dangers associated with mobile technology and the need for vigilance in the military.

In conclusion, the game that had been seen as nothing more than a harmless pastime ended up inadvertently causing a national security scare. The mishap was a stark reminder of the importance of situational awareness and the need for vigilance in military operations. It is unlikely that there will be another Pokémon Go-style situation in the military anytime soon, but the incident serves as an example of how quickly a security issue can arise in the military. Let us hope that those lessons have truly been learned.
