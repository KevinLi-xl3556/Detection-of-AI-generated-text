In recent years, Poland has seen a rise in far-right politics, and the effects of this trend can be seen in many aspects of the country's culture, including its museums. The latest example of this shift to the right is the controversy surrounding the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw.

According to a recent article in The New York Times, several artists have refused to work with the museum, citing its increasingly conservative stance. The museum's director, Joanna Mytkowska, has been accused of censorship, and some of the museum's exhibitions have been met with protests.

The controversy began in 2017, when the museum hosted an exhibition titled "The State in the Middle," which was meant to explore the relationship between the state and the individual. However, some of the works included in the exhibition were seen as critical of the government, and faced protests from right-wing groups. The museum eventually removed some of the artworks in response to the protests.

Since then, the museum has been accused of censoring other works and exhibiting art that is deemed more "acceptable" by the conservative government. This has led several artists to boycott the museum, with some accusing the institution of being complicit in the erosion of democracy in Poland.

The controversy surrounding the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw is just one example of the tension between the country's artistic community and its increasingly conservative government. As the political climate continues to shift in Poland, it remains to be seen how this tension will play out and what it will mean for the future of Polish art and culture.
