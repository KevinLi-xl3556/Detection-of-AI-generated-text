Over the last few years, the fight for a higher minimum wage has picked up tremendous momentum across the United States. With many states and cities passing laws to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, there has been a sense of hope among low-wage workers that they might finally begin to receive the pay they deserve. However, despite this progress, not all workers are benefiting from a higher minimum wage.

In particular, tipped workers, such as servers and bartenders, have been left behind in the rush to raise the minimum wage. While the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is only $2.13 an hour, some states have raised this rate slightly, but it still remains far below the minimum wage for all other workers. As a result, many tipped workers are struggling to make ends meet and are often forced to rely on tips to make up for their low hourly wage.

While some argue that tipped workers do not deserve a higher wage because they can earn a significant amount in tips, this argument is flawed. Tipped workers are at the mercy of customers, who may choose to tip poorly or not at all, leaving them with an inadequate income. Furthermore, many tipped workers face harassment and discrimination from customers and employers, making their jobs even more difficult.

The reality is that raising the minimum wage for all workers, including tipped workers, is essential if we hope to build a fair and just society. The cost of living has continued to rise across the country, making it impossible for low-wage workers to survive on poverty-level wages. In addition, many low-wage workers are essential workers, who have kept our society functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic. They deserve to be compensated with a living wage, just like any other worker.

In conclusion, it is time to recognize that tipped workers deserve a higher minimum wage, just like all other workers. Rather than leaving these workers behind, we must fight for a minimum wage that provides all workers with a fair and just income. Only then can we build a society where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential.
