Fox Host's 'America First' Shift Makes an Exception for Trump's Iran Strike - The New York Times

Fox News, the conservative news network that has long supported President Trump's “America First” policy has seemingly made an exception for the recent US missile strike on Iran. While the attack on the Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani has received widespread criticism, the Fox News network has taken a distinctly different approach by portraying the strike as an act of self-defense that is in line with Trump's vision for America.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham, in her program on the 3rd of January, defended the missile strike by insisting that “Trump has been incredibly consistent on this idea of American protection, American sovereignty". She also said that the President's action was a response to the long history of Iran's "anti-US and anti-Israel" behavior in the region. She went on to say that "this was not an act of war but an act of deterrence," and that "a good defense is often the best offense."

Ingraham's show was just one of many examples of Fox News commentators who have seemingly backed the President's decision to take military action against Iran. Sean Hannity, another Fox News personality, praised Trump for his courage and leadership in handling the Iran crisis. Hannity, who has a close relationship with the President, described Trump as "decisive" and "brave."

Other Fox News hosts and contributors have also jumped to the President's defense, with some arguing that the drone strike was necessary to protect American citizens and interests in the region. While the network has long supported Trump's “America First” policy, the network's shift in tone towards the President's recent actions has come under scrutiny.

Critics of the network have accused Fox News of being overly supportive of the President and not holding him accountable for his actions. They argue that the network's unquestioning support of President Trump is a betrayal of journalistic ethics and is ultimately harming the public's trust in the media.

It is worth noting that not all Fox News hosts have backed President Trump's decision to strike Iran. On his show, Tucker Carlson, who has been critical of the President's foreign policy in the past, questioned the legality of the strike and urged caution in dealing with the situation. Carlson said that “it's unclear what American interests are served” by the strike and that "endless war is not what Trump was elected to promote."

The debate over the US strike against Iran has highlighted the stark divide between those who support President Trump's military actions and those who are critical of them. Fox News, meanwhile, has become the latest battleground in the ongoing struggle over the role of the media in shaping public opinion. As critics continue to call out the network's perceived bias towards the President, it remains to be seen how Fox News will balance its support for “America First” and the need for journalistic integrity in the changing media landscape.
