Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign has announced that it has raised $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, placing her among the top fundraisers in the Democratic presidential field. According to the campaign, more than 900,000 individual donations were made during the quarter, with the average donation amount coming in at $31. 

Warren's campaign has been fueled by grassroots support, with the senator eschewing big-money fundraisers and accepting no donations from corporate PACs. Pete Buttigieg, another top fundraiser in the Democratic race, has attracted criticism for holding private fundraisers with wealthy donors. 

This latest fundraising haul for Warren comes as her campaign maintains its steady rise in the polls. The senator from Massachusetts led the field in October, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll, and has remained in the top tier of candidates in subsequent polls. 

Warren's campaign is focused on issues such as income inequality, student loan debt relief, and expanding access to healthcare. She has proposed a wealth tax on the ultra-rich, which she argues would go a long way toward paying for many of her progressive proposals. 

Despite her strong showing in the polls and fundraising to date, Warren faces a challenging road ahead as the Democratic primary heats up. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders poses a serious challenge to Warren in terms of attracting progressive voters, and former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead in many polls. 

As the field narrows and the primary season kicks into high gear, Warren's campaign will continue to rely on grassroots donations and enthusiastic volunteers to propel her forward. Her performance in early primaries and caucuses in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire will be pivotal in determining whether her campaign can ultimately emerge victorious.
