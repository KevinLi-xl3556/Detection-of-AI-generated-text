On January 6th, 2021, The New York Times published an article titled "Can Penn Station Handle 175,000 More Riders? Cuomo Thinks So." The article discusses Governor Andrew Cuomo's proposed idea to expand Penn Station in New York City to accommodate the growing number of commuters.

As the largest transit hub in the Western Hemisphere, Penn Station sees an average of over 650,000 daily commuters traveling through its doors. However, with the expected opening of Moynihan Train Hall in 2021, which will bring Amtrak and Long Island Rail Road services to the facility, that number is estimated to increase by 175,000 more riders per day.

Governor Cuomo's plan to tackle this expansion includes shifting Amtrak train service from Penn Station to Moynihan Train Hall and creating a new train hall and tracks for the Long Island Rail Road. This would not only relieve congestion in Penn Station but also provide more efficient travel for commuters.

Some critics argue that the plan is not enough and that the entire station needs a complete overhaul. This sentiment was echoed by the design and engineering firm Perkins Eastman, who presented a proposal in 2019 to replace Penn Station completely with a new transit hub that would include more retail space, improved accessibility, and modern architecture.

Despite the differing opinions on how to address the growing number of commuters and the outdated state of Penn Station, it is clear that something needs to be done. As Governor Cuomo stated in his announcement of the plan, "We want to make sure that Penn (Station) is not a bottleneck for regional growth."

Penn Station is not just another transit hub, it is a symbolic gateway to New York City. It is where people from around the world arrive to experience the vitality and opportunities that New York City has to offer. The expansion of this station is vital to accommodating the growing number of commuters and ensuring that the city can continue to thrive.
