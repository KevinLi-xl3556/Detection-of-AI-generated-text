Dr. Heather Ashton, a renowned psychiatrist who was at the forefront of helping people quit anxiety drugs, passed away on January 15th, 2021. The news was confirmed by her family members who said that she died peacefully at her home in Newcastle, England.

Dr. Ashton’s contribution to the field of psychiatry is immeasurable. Her research on benzodiazepines and withdrawal techniques became a cornerstone for treating patients who had become addicted to anxiety drugs. Her authority on the matter has made her a go-to figure in the field of addiction research.

Dr. Ashton studied medicine at the University of Oxford where she graduated with honors in 1954. She then went on to specialize in psychiatry, completing her training at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh in 1961. Over the years, she worked at various psychiatric hospitals and clinics as a consultant psychiatrist. 

It was during this time that Dr. Ashton noticed an alarming trend – people who were prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety relief were getting hooked on the medication. She began to explore ways to help these patients quit the medication, and in 1982, she published the results of her work, “Benzodiazepines: How they Work and How to Withdraw.” 

The book became a landmark in the field of addiction and recovery. Dr. Ashton’s work was the first comprehensive analysis of benzodiazepines, providing insight into how the drugs affect the body and brain, as well as a protocol for tapering off the medication.

Dr. Ashton’s work has helped millions of people around the world. Her protocol for withdrawal from benzodiazepines has been adopted by clinics and recovery centers worldwide. It has also been instrumental in changing the way we view addiction and recovery – emphasizing the importance of gradual, medically-supervised withdrawal rather than a rapid “cold turkey” approach.

Dr. Ashton’s contribution to addiction medicine has earned her numerous awards and honors. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2015 in recognition for her work on benzodiazepines. 

In her later years, Dr. Ashton remained active in her field, participating in research projects and speaking at conferences. Her tireless work has left a lasting legacy in the field of addiction medicine. Her contributions will be missed, but her impact will be felt for generations to come.
