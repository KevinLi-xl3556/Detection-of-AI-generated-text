In a bold move, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York vowed to legalize marijuana in 2020. According to a report by The New York Times, the governor made the announcement during his State of the State address on January 8th, 2020.

Cuomo revealed that the move is part of his social justice agenda, which aims to undo the harm caused by the criminalization of marijuana. He stated that the legalization of marijuana will create a regulated industry that will generate revenue, and address racial and economic disparities in the criminal justice system.

The governor's proposal would allow adult-use of marijuana across the state, though specific details have not yet been released. Cuomo's plan is less comprehensive than other legalization efforts in states like Colorado and California, which allow home cultivation and expungement of prior cannabis convictions.

Despite this, the push by Cuomo is being called a significant step towards marijuana legalization in New York, which is the fourth most populous state in the US, and would represent a major victory for cannabis legalization advocates.

Opponents, however, argue that the move will also bring negative consequences, alleging that marijuana is a gateway drug that can lead to harder drug abuse. However, studies have shown a mixed bag of effects of marijuana legalization in states like Colorado and California have not shown an increase in use of other drugs, but have shown a decrease in opioid-related deaths.

Interestingly, the governor's proposal comes just months after New York City officials announced that they would no longer prosecute marijuana offenses, effectively decriminalizing it in the city. This move has been seen as a catalyst for marijuana legalization efforts across the state.

As momentum grows for legal marijuana, it is expected that more states will follow in the coming years, with a potential shift in federal policy under the incoming Biden-Harris administration. The legal marijuana industry continues to grow at exponential rates, offering new business opportunities and tax revenues for states looking to revitalize their economies.

While it remains to be seen how the legalization of marijuana in New York will play out, it is clear that this is a turning point in the national conversation on drug policy. With advocates pushing for more progressive policies, it is likely that more states will continue to embrace the legalization of marijuana, while the federal government adapts to the new reality of an industry that shows no signs of slowing down.
