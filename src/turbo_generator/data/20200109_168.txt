As the rust belt undergoes economic revitalization, one example stands out - the rebirth of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania.

Located just outside Pittsburgh, this former steel town has been struggling since the decline of the industry in the 1980s. But now, with new businesses and young entrepreneurs moving in, Aliquippa is on the rise again.

What does this mean for President Trump, who has made revitalizing the rust belt a central part of his platform? On the one hand, it’s a positive sign - if Aliquippa can rebound, perhaps other struggling towns can too. On the other hand, it raises questions about Trump’s approach.

Trump’s policies have focused on bringing back manufacturing jobs by renegotiating trade deals, cutting taxes, and easing regulations. But Aliquippa’s growth has come from a mix of businesses - from a whiskey distillery to a women’s center - and a diverse group of entrepreneurs. It’s not just about big factories moving back in.

Moreover, the rebirth of Aliquippa has been aided by state and local initiatives, such as the creation of an innovation district to attract tech startups. These are not policies that come from the top down, but from community-driven efforts.

Aliquippa’s turnaround also highlights an issue with Trump’s focus on coal and steel. While these industries are important to the region, they are also unstable and prone to boom-and-bust cycles. By stressing the revival of these sectors, Trump risks missing out on the potential of other industries, such as healthcare or renewable energy.

Overall, the resurgence of Aliquippa offers a hopeful glimpse into the possibilities of rust belt revitalization. But it also raises questions about how to achieve that goal. Instead of relying solely on nostalgic promises of a return to the past, maybe it’s time for policymakers to take a more nuanced and community-based approach to economic development.
