Marian Finucane, one of Ireland's most well-known broadcasters, has passed away at the age of 69. She was an influential voice in Irish radio and will be sorely missed by her listeners, colleagues, friends, and family.

Starting her broadcasting career as a continuity announcer at RTE, the Irish national broadcaster, in 1974, Finucane quickly made an impression with her warmth, intelligence, and ability to connect with her audience. Over the years, she took on a variety of roles, but it was as a current affairs presenter that she made her greatest impact.

From 1985 to 1999, Finucane presented "Women Today," a programme that explored issues affecting women and their families. Her non-judgmental approach, sensitivity, and ability to tackle difficult subjects with tact and empathy earned her a loyal following, as well as numerous accolades and awards.

In 1999, Finucane took over the mid-morning show on RTE Radio 1, a slot she would hold for the remainder of her career. Her style was conversational rather than confrontational, but she wasn't afraid to ask tough questions or challenge her guests when necessary. Her interviews were always well-researched and insightful, and she had a knack for drawing out her guests' personalities, stories, and opinions.

Finucane's influence extended beyond the airwaves. She was a champion of social justice and equality, and her broadcasts often shone a light on issues that were often overlooked or ignored, such as homelessness, infant mortality, and mental health. She was also an advocate for women's rights and a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.

Finucane's contribution to Irish broadcasting was recognised by her peers and the public alike. She won numerous awards during her career, including two lifetime achievement awards, and was inducted into the Irish Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2010. She was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Dublin City University in recognition of her contribution to Irish society.

Marian Finucane's death has left a huge void in Irish broadcasting. She was a genuine, compassionate, and intelligent voice, who was respected and loved by many. Her legacy is one of excellence, empathy, and a commitment to making a positive difference. She will be greatly missed, but her influence will continue to be felt for many years to come.
