Opinion | The Arrogance of Trump's Enablers - The New York Times

As the end of his term draws near, President Trump's enablers are still working hard to justify their loyalty to an administration marred by scandal and controversy. From former White House officials to Republican lawmakers, those who have enabled the president's actions are exhibiting a level of arrogance that is bewildering.

The arrogant behavior of Trump's enablers is rooted in the belief that they are above any criticism or accountability. Despite the numerous instances in which the president has undermined the rule of law, attacked the free press, and spread false information, they continue to defend him.

The actions of the enablers have led to an erosion of the country's democratic institutions, with the president's attacks on the judiciary and law enforcement agencies being particularly grievous. Instead of holding the administration accountable, they have chosen to look the other way while the president carries out his damaging policies.

This lack of accountability has given rise to an administration in which the president is able to act with impunity. With no one willing to hold him responsible for his actions, the president has been free to flout the ethical standards that are the cornerstone of democratic governance.

The arrogance of the enablers also extends to their treatment of the press. The president's constant attacks on the media have created an environment in which reporters are viciously attacked, harassed, and targeted for violence. Those who have enabled the president's actions have shown a complete lack of regard for the role of the free press in a democratic society. 

It is imperative that the enablers are held accountable for their actions, both in the present and in the future. Their lack of accountability has allowed the president to undermine institutions and destroy democratic norms with alarming ease. The damage that has been done to the country's democratic institutions and the erosion of public trust in government are symptoms of their arrogance.

In the coming years, it is imperative that the country learns from the disastrous consequences of allowing enablers to go unchallenged. The erosion of democratic institutions should serve as a cautionary tale of the dangers of allowing autocratic leaders to operate with impunity. Trump's enablers must be held accountable to ensure that democratic governance is upheld and the erosion of standards is never allowed to happen again.
