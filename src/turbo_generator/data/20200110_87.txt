Justin Bieber’s Flavorless Pivot to R&B, and 10 More New Songs - The New York Times

Justin Bieber, the Canadian pop star known for his catchy dance tracks and boyish charm, has always flirted with R&B in his music. However, with his latest album, “Changes,” he’s made a full pivot to the genre, resulting in a collection of songs that, while admirably polished, feel a bit flavorless.

Released on Valentine’s Day, “Changes” is Bieber’s first album in five years, and his first since his well-publicized struggles with depression and substance abuse. In a recent interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, Bieber described “Changes” as “inspired by life, love, and his wife, Hailey.”

While it’s clear that Bieber is in a happier place emotionally, the music on “Changes” is largely forgettable. The album consists of 16 tracks, but many of them blend together, with little to distinguish them from one another. The production is slick, but lacks the creativity and spark that have made Bieber’s earlier hits so infectious.

That’s not to say that “Changes” is a complete misfire. The standout track is undoubtedly “Intentions,” featuring Quavo of Migos. The song is undeniably catchy, and Quavo’s verse adds some much-needed energy to the album. “Forever,” a duet with Post Malone and Clever, is another highlight, featuring some soaring vocals from Bieber.

Unfortunately, these two songs are exceptions rather than the rule. Most of the other tracks on “Changes” are middling, with repetitive melodies and generic lyrics about love and relationships. It’s clear that Bieber is trying to tap into the current R&B zeitgeist, but he falls short. Instead of creating something fresh and exciting, he’s given us an album that feels like a bland imitation of what’s already out there.

However, there is still hope for Bieber. He’s proven himself to be a talented performer, and his earlier hits like “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?” remain incredibly catchy. He just needs to find a way to infuse his new music with that same infectious energy.

In the meantime, there are plenty of other new songs to enjoy. Here are 10 recent releases that stand out:

1. “Life Is Good” by Future featuring Drake: This collaboration between two of rap’s biggest stars is a banger, with a catchy hook and some slick rhymes from both artists.

2. “The Box” by Roddy Ricch: This song has been everywhere lately, thanks to its insanely catchy chorus and infectious beat.

3. “No Time To Die” by Billie Eilish: The 18-year-old pop star’s James Bond theme is haunting and beautiful, with Eilish’s signature whispery vocals lending a sense of melancholy to the track.

4. “What A Man Gotta Do” by Jonas Brothers: The JoBros keep their comeback going with this upbeat, retro-inspired track that’s impossible not to dance to.
