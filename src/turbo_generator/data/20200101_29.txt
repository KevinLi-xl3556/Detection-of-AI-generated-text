As the 2020 Golden Globes approach, film lovers and award show enthusiasts alike are buzzing with excitement about which movies will come out on top. With so many exceptional films hitting theaters in the past year, the competition is stiff, and predicting the winners is no easy feat.

The New York Times has compiled a list of predictions, analyzing the nominees and their performances throughout the year to help give a sense of what to expect. Here's a breakdown of some of the biggest categories and our predictions for who the winners will be.

Best Motion Picture - Drama

The nominees in this category include The Irishman, Marriage Story, 1917, Joker, and The Two Popes. While all five films are deserving of recognition, it's hard to deny that Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is the front-runner. With a cast of some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, this epic mob drama has been generating buzz since its release on Netflix. The only real competition in this category comes from Marriage Story, which has garnered acclaim for its heartbreaking portrayal of divorce and features standout performances from Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. However, we still believe that The Irishman will come out on top.

Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama

This category features some of the most exceptional performances of the year, with nominees including Christian Bale (Ford v Ferrari), Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory), Adam Driver (Marriage Story), Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), and Jonathan Pryce (The Two Popes). While Banderas and Pryce both delivered nuanced and layered performances, we predict that the winner will be Joaquin Phoenix for his haunting portrayal of the titular character in Joker. Phoenix gave himself over entirely to the role, creating an unforgettable and chilling performance that will go down in cinematic history.

Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama

In this category, the nominees are Cynthia Erivo (Harriet), Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story), Saoirse Ronan (Little Women), Charlize Theron (Bombshell), and Renée Zellweger (Judy). All five actresses delivered stellar performances, but Renée Zellweger stands out as the favorite for her stunning portrayal of Judy Garland in Judy. Zellweger completely transformed herself and disappeared into the role, bringing new depth and understanding to a Hollywood icon.

Of course, these are just predictions, and the Golden Globes are known for their surprises and upsets. Regardless of who takes home the trophies, it's clear that 2019 was a fantastic year for film, and we can't wait to see what the industry will bring us in 2020.
