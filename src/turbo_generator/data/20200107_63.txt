James Parks Morton, the visionary dean who transformed the Cathedral of St. John the Divine from a neglected New York City landmark into a vibrant center of spirituality and culture, has died at the age of 89. Morton, who served as the cathedral's dean for 25 years, passed away on September 26th at his home in Rhinebeck, New York, from complications related to Parkinson's disease.

Morton became dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in 1972, at a time when the massive Gothic church was in a state of disrepair and facing serious financial difficulties. Through his leadership, the cathedral underwent a remarkable transformation, becoming a hub of artistic, intellectual, and spiritual activity that drew visitors from around the world.

Under Morton's guidance, the cathedral hosted concerts, lectures, and art exhibitions, and became a center for interfaith dialogue and social justice advocacy. He also led a massive renovation effort of the physical structure, including the installation of new stained-glass windows and the addition of several chapels dedicated to different faiths.

But perhaps Morton's greatest legacy was his ability to leverage the cathedral's stature and influence to address pressing social problems, from poverty and homelessness to environmental degradation and international conflict. He helped found a number of organizations dedicated to these causes, including the Interfaith Assembly on Homelessness and Housing, GreenFaith, and the Two-Thirds World Fund, which supported development projects in the global South.

In an era when organized religion was often seen as out of touch and dogmatic, Morton's approach was refreshingly progressive and inclusive. He welcomed spiritual seekers of all faiths and backgrounds, and sought to promote understanding and dialogue between different religious traditions. He also embraced progressive causes like LGBTQ rights and women's empowerment, making the cathedral a safe space for marginalized communities to come together and find support.

Throughout his career, Morton received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to religion, the arts, and social justice. He was a beloved figure in the New York City community, and his death is being mourned by many who were touched by his kindness, wisdom, and vision.

As the cathedral's current dean, the Very Rev. Clifton Daniel III, wrote in a statement, "James Parks Morton's leadership at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine was truly transformational, and his legacy will endure for generations to come. We are all deeply grateful for his life and ministry, and we will miss him profoundly."
