Prince Harry's Real Declaration of Independence: From Britain's Tabloids - The New York Times

Prince Harry's decision to step back from his royal duties and split his time between the UK and North America may have shocked and dismayed many fans and onlookers. But for the Duke of Sussex, it was a necessary move, one that allowed him to free himself from the constant scrutiny of Britain's tabloid press and protect himself and his family from unrelenting media attention.

For years, Prince Harry has been a target of the tabloid press. The death of his mother, Princess Diana, at the hands of paparazzi photographers in 1997 left a deep impression on him, and he has frequently spoken out about the impact of media intrusion on his mental health. Yet in recent years, this media intrusion has only intensified, with the press hounding him and his wife, Meghan Markle, at every turn.

The couple's relationship has been a particular focus, with tabloids publishing a steady stream of stories about rifts between the couple, feuds with the rest of the royal family, and Markle's supposed "difficult" behavior. Even the couple's decision to step back from their roles as senior royals was spun into a narrative of Harry being "under the thumb" of his American wife.

This persistent scrutiny has taken a toll on the prince. In a recent interview with ITV's Tom Bradby, he spoke candidly about the mental health struggles he has faced as a result of his mother's death and the media's constant presence in his life. "I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum," he stated.

But the decision to step back from royal duties was not just about protecting his own mental health. It was also about protecting his family. In their statement announcing the move, Harry and Markle cited the "intense scrutiny" they had faced and the need to "carve out a progressive new role" within the royal family, one that allowed them to balance their public duties with their private lives.

The move to North America also makes sense in this context. The couple has long faced criticism from the tabloid press for their use of private jets and luxury holidays, but in Canada, they will be able to live a more private life away from the public eye. It also puts them closer in proximity to Markle's family, who are based in Los Angeles.

Prince Harry's decision to step back from royal duties and declare his independence from Britain's tabloid press is a brave and necessary move. With his mother's tragic death still fresh in the minds of many, it is heartening to see him taking proactive steps to protect himself and his family from the same fate. Hopefully, the media will respect his wishes and allow him to live a more peaceful and private life.
