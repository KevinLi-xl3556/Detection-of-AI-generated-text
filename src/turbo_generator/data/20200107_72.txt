After years of resistance, Boeing has finally recommended simulator training for pilots before they can fly the 737 Max planes. This is a reversal of their earlier stand that claimed the plane's features were enough for pilots to fly without additional simulator training. The decision comes in the wake of two deadly crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019 that claimed a total of 346 lives.

Boeing has come under intense scrutiny in the aftermath of the crashes, with many questioning the company's safety procedures and training protocols. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the 737 Max planes in March 2019, and they have yet to return to service. Boeing has been working diligently to restore confidence in the plane's safety and to address the issues that led to the crashes.

The company's decision to recommend simulator training is a step in the right direction for rebuilding trust in the plane. The move shows that Boeing is taking the safety of passengers and crew seriously and is willing to make the necessary changes to ensure their safety.

The need for simulator training was identified in a review conducted by a task force assembled by the FAA after the two crashes. The task force concluded that pilots needed more extensive training on the plane's automated features, including the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was suspected of contributing to the crashes.

According to the New York Times, Boeing is already working on designing and building simulators, which will be delivered to airlines by mid-2021. The company has also agreed to pay $2.5 billion in fines for criminal charges related to the crashes, which is the largest ever paid by a manufacturer in the United States.

Boeing's recommendation of simulator training is a positive step forward, but there is still more that needs to be done. The FAA and other regulatory bodies worldwide need to conduct rigorous testing and certification before the plane can be deemed safe and allowed to fly again. Passengers and crew also need to be confident in the plane's safety before they board it.

In conclusion, Boeing's reversal on recommending simulator training is a step in the right direction for rebuilding trust in the company and the 737 Max planes. The decision shows that the company is taking the safety of passengers and crew seriously and is willing to make changes to ensure their safety. The company still has a long way to go before the planes are deemed safe to fly again, but this is a positive step forward.
