Hudson Yards promised a park. They didnâ€™t mention the giant wall.

Back in 2005, developers of the Hudson Yards project in Manhattan made a promise to the community: they would build a magnificent 14-acre public park that would serve as a green oasis in the bustling city. The park was supposed to be an essential part of the development, providing much-needed green space for the residents of New York City.

However, as the project has developed over the years, it has become clear to many that the promised park is not what it was cracked up to be. In particular, a massive concrete retaining wall towering over the northern end of the site has left many feeling shortchanged.

The wall, which stands at 30 feet high and 1,000 feet long, was built to hold back the Hudson River as developers dug out the land for the project's foundation. But, it has become something of an eyesore on the landscape, and many are complaining that the wall is not only aesthetically unappealing but also obstructive to the view of the river.

What is even more disappointing is that the developers have also failed to integrate the wall into their plans for the 14-acre park. Instead, the wall is an imposing feature that cuts across the northern end of the site, creating a barrier between the park and the river.

Many residents and organizations in the community have spoken out against the wall, calling on the developers to find a way to make the structure more appealing and integrated into the overall design of the park. There have even been calls for the developers to use the wall as an opportunity to integrate public art into the development, creating something beautiful and functional.

In conclusion, the Hudson Yards park has fallen short of its promise to residents, with the giant concrete wall becoming a symbol of this failure. The developers of the Hudson Yards project need to take the concerns of the community seriously and find a way to make the wall an integral part of the park's design. Not only will this improve the aesthetics of the park, but it will also help to create a more cohesive and inclusive space for all residents of New York City.
