In the race for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker raised more money in the second quarter of the year but still trail significantly behind the leading candidates.

According to The New York Times, Klobuchar raised $3.87 million in the second quarter, while Booker raised $4.5 million. However, these numbers pale in comparison to the fundraising numbers of frontrunners like Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, who raised $18 million and $12 million respectively.

Despite the lower fundraising levels, both Klobuchar and Booker remain optimistic about their campaigns. Klobuchar highlighted her ability to appeal to moderate voters and win in states that Democrats typically struggle in, such as her home state of Minnesota. Booker emphasized his grassroots support and ability to energize young voters.

While fundraising is a significant aspect of any political campaign, it is not necessarily a predictor of success. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump's campaign spent significantly less money than Hillary Clinton's but still managed to win the election.

Ultimately, the success of Klobuchar and Booker's campaigns will depend on their ability to connect with voters and communicate their visions for the future of the country. As the campaign heats up in the coming months, these candidates will have multiple opportunities to do just that - through debates, town halls, and rallies.

The race for the Democratic nomination remains wide open, and candidates like Klobuchar and Booker are still in the running. While they may not have raised as much money as some of their competitors, their determination and commitment to the campaign will make them ones to watch in the coming months.
