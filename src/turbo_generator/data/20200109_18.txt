As I leafed through the pages of The New York Times, I came across a poem that resonated deeply with me. The title of the poem was "Practice," and it was written by Barbara Ras. As a writer myself, I was struck by the simplicity yet depth of its message.

The poem begins with a powerful line: "We have the practice of morning." It immediately conjures up imagery of the routine of our daily lives, the way in which we wake up and start our day. But from there, the poem takes on a more introspective tone as it explores the idea of "practice" beyond just a simple routine.

Ras writes, "We practice patience/With ourselves,/Patience with others." This line speaks to the importance of cultivating empathy and understanding in our interactions with those around us. We must not only be patient with ourselves as we navigate our own challenges and growth, but also extend that same patience to others.

The poem goes on to highlight other aspects of "practice" such as "listening," "appreciating," and "letting go." It reminds us that practice is not just about repetition, but about actively working on ourselves and our relationships with others.

One of the lines that resonated with me the most was: "We practice resurrection." To me, this speaks to the idea of constantly renewing ourselves and our lives, even in the face of hardship and adversity. It is through practice that we are able to grow and evolve, to become better versions of ourselves.

Overall, "Practice" is a beautiful reminder that life is a journey, and that the key to growth and happiness is to actively engage in the practice of living. As Ras writes, "We take deep breaths, we renew ourselves/In a new day/On a new planet." It is up to us to embrace this practice, and to continually work towards becoming the best version of ourselves that we can be.
