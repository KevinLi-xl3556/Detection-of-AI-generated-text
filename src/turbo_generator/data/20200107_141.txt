As the new year approaches, many people begin to think about their resolutions. They might resolve to lose weight, save more money, or find a new job. But there's one resolution that could benefit everyone, no matter what their goals are: resolving to be coached.

Coaching has become a popular way to improve performance in everything from sports to business to personal relationships. A coach can provide guidance, support, and feedback that can help people reach their full potential. But even though coaching is widely recognized as a valuable tool, many people are resistant to the idea of being coached.

Some people might think that coaching is only for people who are struggling or need to improve their skills. But the truth is that even the most successful people can benefit from coaching. In fact, many top performers have personal coaches who help them stay focused and motivated, and to continue to grow and improve.

Others might be reluctant to be coached because they think it could be embarrassing or uncomfortable. But coaching is not about judgment or criticism. A good coach will provide constructive feedback that can help people identify areas where they can improve, and offer strategies to help them make progress.

So why should you resolve to be coached in the new year? Here are a few reasons:

1. Coaching can help you achieve your goals. Whether you're trying to improve your career, your relationships, or your health, a coach can help you identify the steps you need to take to get there.

2. Coaching can help you stay focused and motivated. It's easy to get distracted or discouraged when you're trying to make changes in your life. But a coach can help you stay on track and keep your eyes on the prize.

3. Coaching can help you develop new skills. Whether you want to learn how to be a better communicator, a better leader, or a better athlete, a coach can help you develop the skills you need to succeed.

4. Coaching can help you unlock your potential. Everyone has the potential to achieve great things, but sometimes it takes someone else to help us see what we're capable of.

So if you're thinking about your resolutions for the new year, consider resolving to be coached. Whether you hire a personal coach, seek out a mentor, or join a coaching program, committing to being coached could be the best decision you make all year.
