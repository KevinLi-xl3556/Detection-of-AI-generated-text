On Monday, January 4th, two children in Milwaukee were shot and wounded after allegedly throwing snowballs at passing cars. The incident marks yet another tragedy in the ongoing cycle of gun violence that has afflicted the United States for far too long.

According to police reports, the two victims, aged 12 and 13, were with a group of children when they began throwing snowballs at passing cars. One of the drivers, an adult male, became enraged and fired shots at the group. The two children were hit and sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The shooter, who has not yet been identified or apprehended, fled the scene in his vehicle.

This incident highlights the severe consequences of gun violence in America, and the dangerous and unpredictable nature of civilian gun use. The fact that a man would respond to a group of children throwing snowballs with a gun, rather than simply driving away or reporting the incident to police, is deeply troubling.

Furthermore, this act of violence occurred in a city that has already experienced a staggering number of shootings over the past year. According to data from the Milwaukee Police Department, there were over 190 homicides in the city in 2020, a 95% increase from the previous year. The majority of these homicides involved firearms.

It is clear that we need to take action to address the root causes of gun violence in America. This includes implementing stronger gun control measures, providing mental health resources and support to those in need, and addressing systemic inequalities that contribute to community violence.

As we move forward, we must remember that the victims of gun violence are real people with families, friends, and entire communities who are impacted by their loss. It is our responsibility as a society to work towards creating a safer and more compassionate world, free from the senseless violence that plagues our nation.
