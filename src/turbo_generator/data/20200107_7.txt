The recent killing of Iran’s top military commander, General Qassim Soleimani, has sparked controversy and outrage across the world. The United States government, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, claimed responsibility for the deadly strike. However, many people are questioning the legality and morality of the action, and are using one word to describe it: assassination.

Assassination is a loaded term. It connotes a premeditated and unlawful killing of an individual, usually for political or ideological reasons. The use of this word to describe General Soleimani’s death is no accident. Critics of the Trump administration argue that the killing was not only illegal under international law, but also an act of aggression and provocation against Iran.

The U.S. government argues that the killing was necessary to protect American lives and interests in the region. Officials claim that General Soleimani was responsible for planning and executing attacks against American citizens and military personnel. They argue that the strike was an act of self-defense.

However, the legality of the strike has come into question. Under international law, targeted killings are only legal in very specific circumstances, such as in cases of imminent threat to life. Many legal experts argue that the killing of General Soleimani did not meet these criteria. Additionally, the U.S. Congress was not consulted or briefed on the operation beforehand, which has raised concerns about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government.

The use of the term “assassination” to describe General Soleimani’s death is also significant in that it carries a moral weight. The term suggests that the killing was not just illegal, but also unethical. It implies that the U.S. government had other options besides killing General Soleimani, but chose to use lethal force instead. It suggests that the U.S. government does not value human life or respect the sovereignty of other nations.

The controversy surrounding General Soleimani’s death has sparked protests and condemnation around the world. Iranian leaders have vowed to retaliate against the United States, and tensions between the two countries have escalated.

In conclusion, the use of the term “assassination” to describe General Soleimani’s death is not just a matter of semantics. It reflects the deep-seated concerns of many people about the legality and morality of the U.S. government’s actions. It suggests that the use of lethal force should only be a last resort, and that diplomacy and dialogue should be prioritized. The world is watching and waiting to see what comes next.
