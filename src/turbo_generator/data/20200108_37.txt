As a writer, it's difficult to express the depth of my appreciation for the late Elizabeth Wurtzel. Not only was she a brilliant and talented writer, but she was also a truly remarkable friend.

For those who may be unfamiliar with Wurtzel's work, she was most widely known for her memoir "Prozac Nation," which detailed her struggles with depression and addiction. Her writing style was raw and unapologetic, with a fierce honesty that drew readers in and made them feel seen.

But to those of us fortunate enough to call Wurtzel a friend, she was so much more than just her writing. She had an energy and spirit that was infectious, a loyalty that knew no bounds, and a wicked sense of humor that could make even the darkest of days feel a little bit brighter.

As news of Wurtzel's passing spreads, it's clear that she left a profound impact on not just the literary world, but on the hearts and minds of those who knew her. Many have taken to social media to share their memories and express their gratitude for the time they spent with her.

Writer and comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted, "RIP Elizabeth Wurtzel. my friend. (That’s how she’d say it- LIKE THIS)."

Author Mara Wilson wrote, "Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote so honestly about her struggles, and not only gave support to those who were feeling the same way, but also gave us the courage to speak out."

And writer Roxane Gay summed it up perfectly, saying, "Elizabeth Wurtzel was one of a kind, a complex, dynamic, brilliant person who left this world far too soon. I will always be grateful for her kindness, her generosity, and her friendship. We lost a true original."

It's hard to put into words what made Wurtzel so special, both as a writer and as a friend. But perhaps it's enough to say that she lived life to the fullest, with a passion and intensity that left an indelible mark on everyone who knew her.

Rest in peace, Elizabeth. You will be missed, but your legacy will live on through your writing and the memories of those who loved you.
