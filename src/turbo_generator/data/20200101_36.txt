As we close out the year 2019 and reflect on the progress made towards achieving equality for all, there are many inspiring stories that have given us hope. Despite the challenges faced across the globe, people continue to stand up for what is right and work towards a more equitable society. Here are just a few examples of the stories that gave us hope this year:

In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made history by becoming only the second world leader to give birth while in office. She returned to work just six weeks after giving birth and introduced a policy that provides paid leave for parents who have experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth. Her commitment to family-friendly policies and gender equity has set an example for leaders all around the world.

In the United States, the #MeToo movement continued to make waves, with more high-profile figures being held accountable for their actions. The movement has allowed survivors of sexual assault and harassment to speak out and demand justice, and has sparked important conversations about consent and workplace culture.

In India, the landmark decision to decriminalize homosexuality brought hope to the LGBTQ+ community. The ruling marked a major victory for human rights in a country where same-sex relationships were punishable by law only a year prior. The decision was not only a step towards greater equality, but it also showed that progress can be made even in the face of opposition and discrimination.

The election of Zuzana Caputova as the first female president of Slovakia was also a momentous occasion for gender equality. Caputova ran on a platform of inclusivity and justice, and her victory sent a powerful message to women and girls that their voices and opinions matter in politics. She has also been an advocate for environmental causes, showing that intersectionality is key to building a more equitable world.

Finally, the youth-led climate strikes that took place around the world showed that young people are not only concerned about their future, but that they are also willing to take action to make a difference. The strikes saw millions of young people mobilize and demand action on climate change from political leaders. Their activism and determination serve as a reminder that the fight for a more equitable world is not limited to issues of gender or race, but extends to the environment and the planet that we all share.

These are just a few of the stories that have given us hope this year. They show that progress towards greater equality is possible, and that despite the challenges, people continue to stand up for what is right. As we move into a new year and a new decade, these stories serve as a reminder that the fight for equality is far from over, but that together, we can continue to strive towards a more equitable future.
