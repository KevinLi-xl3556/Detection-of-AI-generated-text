The Venice Biennale, one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions, has just announced Cecilia Alemani as the curator for its upcoming 59th edition in 2022. Alemani is a well-known Italian curator, who has served as the Artistic Director of High Line Art in New York since 2011.

Alemani's appointment to the Venice Biennale has already generated excitement in the international art world. Many believe that she is poised to introduce new perspectives and innovative ideas to the exhibition, which has been a mainstay of the art world since its inception in 1895.

In addition to her tenure at High Line Art, Alemani has curated several exhibitions, including the 55th edition of the Venice Biennale in 2013, where she curated the Italian Pavilion. Her work has been marked by a commitment to promoting emerging artists, as well as a dedication to exploring the intersections of art, architecture, and urban planning.

In a statement about her appointment, Alemani expressed her excitement about the upcoming Biennale, saying, "I am honored and thrilled to have been entrusted with the task of curating the next Venice Biennale. This is an extraordinary opportunity to engage with some of the most important artists working today, and to create a platform that fosters dialogue and collaboration across different cultural and artistic contexts."

The Venice Biennale has a long and storied history, having served as a launching pad for some of the most important artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. It has also been a hub for critical debate and discussion around important social and political issues.

Given Alemani's track record and her commitment to exploring new territories in the art world, it is clear that she is poised to help the Venice Biennale continue to push the boundaries of contemporary art.

The 59th edition of the Venice Biennale is scheduled to take place from April 23 to November 27, 2022. With Cecilia Alemani at its helm, it promises to be an exhibition that will capture the attention of the global art community, and continue to inspire artists and audiences around the world for years to come.
