The annual Oscars, which have been celebrated for 92 years, are one of the most prestigious events in the entertainment industry. For many years, the Oscars have had a host to steer the show but in recent times, the ceremony's hosts have come under scrutiny. The 2019 Oscars didn't have a host due to the Kevin Hart controversy; and the host of the 2018 Oscars, Jimmy Kimmel, received backlash for his comments on sensitive matters.

This year, the show will go on without a host once again as The New York Times reported that the producers of the Oscars have decided not to have a host for the 2020 ceremony.

According to the reports, the producers had been in talks for a couple of months with several potential hosts but finally decided to opt-out of the idea of having hosts at all. Instead, the Oscars will have a lineup of presenters and guest performers who will take the stage to present awards and entertain the audience.

The producers' decision to not have a host for the 2020 Oscars may have been influenced by the previous years' controversies. As seen from the Kevin Hart situation, having a host who has made insensitive remarks in the past could backfire.

The 2020 Oscars ceremony will take place on the 9th of February at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The producers have promised to put on a spectacular show even without a host, with a mixed bag of live performances, musical performances, and exclusive presentations.

Many have shown support for the idea of not having a host as it opens room for more performers in the ceremony. Also, given the recent rise in the number of award shows and events for the industry, no host provides a sense of relief to ensure the ceremony is brief.

In conclusion, the decision of the Oscars to have no host for the 2020 ceremony could be seen as a step in the right direction in making the event more straightforward and enjoyable for all. With a mixture of presenters, performers, and undoubtedly exciting awards, the Oscar ceremony has something to offer every person in the entertainment industry.
