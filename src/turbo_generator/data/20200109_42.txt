Opinion | Black Britons Know Why Meghan Markle Wants Out

The recent announcement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to step down from their roles as senior members of the royal family has captured the attention of the world. While there are many different opinions on why the couple has made this decision, one particular group has a unique perspective on the matter: black Britons.

As a black Briton myself, it’s easy for me to understand why Markle would want to escape the intense scrutiny and criticism she has faced since joining the royal family. Even before her marriage to Harry, she was the subject of countless racist remarks and comments from the British media. Her mixed-race heritage and status as an American actress made her a target for those who believe she didn’t belong in the royal family.

Since becoming a member of the family, Markle has faced even more racism and discrimination. The media has relentlessly attacked her, criticizing everything from her fashion choices to her parenting style. The double standards she’s faced in comparison to her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, have been particularly stark. Middleton has been praised for doing the exact same things that Markle has been criticized for.

As black Britons, we’ve seen this kind of treatment before. We know what it’s like to be judged and discriminated against based on the color of our skin. We’ve experienced the frustration of being held to different standards than our white counterparts. It’s no surprise that Markle has reached her breaking point and wants to leave this toxic environment behind.

What’s particularly telling about the reaction to Markle’s decision is how it’s highlighted the racial divide in Britain. Black Britons are largely supportive of her decision, while many white Britons have criticized her for “abandoning” the royal family. This speaks to a larger issue of white privilege and the inability of some to acknowledge the impact racism has on the lives of people of color.

Markle’s decision to leave the royal family is a wake-up call for Britain. It’s time for the country to confront its issues with racism and privilege. Until we do, stories like Markle’s will continue to make headlines and reveal the ugly truth about how some segments of British society view people of color.

In the end, Markle’s decision is a courageous act of self-preservation. It’s a reminder that no one should have to endure racism and discrimination in silence. As black Britons, we stand with her and support her decision to put her mental health and well-being first. We hope that this will lead to a larger conversation about racism in Britain and eventually bring about real change.
