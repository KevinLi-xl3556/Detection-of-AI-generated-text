After Homes Collapse in Earthquake, Puerto Ricans Ask: Are We Safe? â€“ The New York Times

Puerto Ricans have been hit hard by a series of earthquakes that have rocked the island since December 2019. Homes have collapsed, leaving many homeless and wondering if they are safe living on the island. The most significant earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.4, struck on January 7, 2020, and destroyed hundreds of homes.

Many of the affected people are still living in tents or sheltering in their cars, while others have fled the island altogether. The situation has left Puerto Ricans asking themselves: are we safe? The earthquakes have not only caused physical damage but also emotional and mental distress.

The Puerto Rican government has estimated that around 8,000 homes were damaged in the earthquakes, and at least six people lost their lives. The situation has been made worse by the fact that the island is still recovering from Hurricane Maria, which struck in 2017, causing widespread damage and leaving many without power or water for months.

Puerto Ricans feel that they have been left alone to deal with the aftermath of the earthquakes. Some have criticized the lack of government response and the lax enforcement of building codes that could have prevented some of the damage. Although Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, the Trump administration has been criticized for its slow response and lack of support.

Despite the challenges, many Puerto Ricans remain hopeful and resilient. They are working together to rebuild their homes and their lives, relying on each other for support. The earthquakes have brought communities closer together as they work to overcome a common challenge.

The earthquakes have also reminded Puerto Ricans of their vulnerability to natural disasters. While the island is known for its natural beauty, it is also prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. The situation has raised questions about how prepared the island is for future disasters and what more needs to be done.

In conclusion, the earthquakes that have hit Puerto Rico have left many people struggling to rebuild their lives and their homes. The situation has raised questions about the island's preparedness for natural disasters and the response of the government and outside organizations. However, the resilience and strength of the Puerto Rican people have shone through, and they are working together to overcome this challenge.
