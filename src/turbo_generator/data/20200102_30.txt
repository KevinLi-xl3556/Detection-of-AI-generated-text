Mark Galli, the editor-in-chief of Christianity Today recently penned an article criticizing the “ethical naïveté” of those who remain staunch supporters of President Trump. His article, titled “Trump Should Be Removed From Office,” has caused quite a stir in the evangelical community.

In his piece, Galli points specifically to Trump’s immoral behavior and the impact that it has on the Christian witness. He points out that evangelicals have long been at the forefront of advocating for moral values in public life, and that this support for Trump undermines their credibility.

“This president has been an advocate for policies that are explicitly un-Christian,” Galli writes. “But even more importantly, he has been an immoral man—boastful, arrogant, vindictive, unrepentant—whom no Christian should support.”

Galli’s article has sparked a variety of reactions, with some applauding his courage in speaking out against the president and others criticizing him for being politically motivated. Some have argued that by condemning Trump, Galli is also condemning the millions of Americans who voted for him.

While it is true that many evangelicals support Trump for his stance on issues such as abortion and religious liberty, Galli argues that Christian witness is more important than any one policy. He believes that supporting Trump undermines the moral authority of the church and that Christians should be leading the way in speaking out against immorality and corruption.

Despite the backlash, Galli stands by his article and his call for Trump’s removal from office. He believes that the church needs to take a stand on morality and that this means being willing to speak out—even when it is uncomfortable or unpopular.

“The Church’s job is not to endorse political candidates or parties,” Galli writes. “It is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to bear witness to his love in a broken world. And when we see something that is clearly immoral and ungodly, we have a responsibility to speak out.”

As the debate over Trump’s impeachment rages on, Galli’s words serve as a reminder to Christians to remain focused on what really matters—the Gospel message of love and redemption. While political wrangling and power struggles are important, they should not distract from the ultimate goal of spreading God’s love and truth to a world in need.
