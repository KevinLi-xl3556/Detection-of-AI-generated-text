The Trump administration has been making significant changes to environmental regulations in recent years. While these changes might seem beneficial to some industries, they come at a significant cost to the public. Trump’s weakening of environmental rules would leave the public in the dark about the impacts of pollutants and toxic chemicals on their health and the environment.

One of the most significant changes made by the Trump administration was to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) review process for new chemicals. In 2016, the EPA updated its Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require manufacturers to submit new chemical applications for review before they entered the market. The overhaul provided the EPA with the necessary authority to assess the risk of new chemicals before approving them.

However, the Trump administration rolled back this overhaul, and chemical manufacturers were no longer required to submit new chemical applications for review before they entered the market. This change means that new and potentially hazardous chemicals could be introduced into the market without any review or evaluation for their environmental or health impacts.

Moreover, the weakening of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) could have a significant impact on the public's ability to access information about environmental risks. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of major decisions and projects. However, under the Trump administration's latest proposal, many projects would be exempt from NEPA requirements, leaving communities largely in the dark about the risks they are facing.

The Trump administration has also weakened the Clean Air Act by rolling back regulations on pollution from power plants, allowing the oil and gas industry to release more methane into the atmosphere, and weakening automobile emission standards. These changes could lead to increased exposure to toxic pollutants like mercury, lead, and asbestos, which can result in severe respiratory and neurological problems.

All of these actions have significant consequences for public health and safety. By weakening environmental regulations, the Trump administration is prioritizing the interests of industry over those of ordinary citizens, who rely on clean air, water, and soil for their health and well-being.

In conclusion, Trump’s weakening of environmental rules would leave the public in the dark about the impacts of pollutants and toxic chemicals on their health and the environment. It is time for the administration to recognize the hazardous impact of these changes and prioritize the health and safety of the public. The EPA and other federal and state agencies must take action to protect the environment and the public from the harmful effects of pollution and chemical exposure.
