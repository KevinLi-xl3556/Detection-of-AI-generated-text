Buck Henry, a legendary comedy writer, director, and actor who helped shape the landscape of American cinema with his seminal works, has passed away at the age of 89. His passing was confirmed by his wife, Irene Ramp, who said he died of a heart attack in Los Angeles.

Henry was an iconic figure in the entertainment industry, and his legacy will be forever entwined with some of the most beloved films and television shows in history. He was a gifted writer and producer whose humor and wit helped define the sensibilities of an entire generation of artists and writers.

One of Henry's most significant contributions was helping create the iconic spy-comedy series, "Get Smart," which he co-created with Mel Brooks. The show starred Don Adams as the bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart, also known as Agent 86, and Barbara Feldon as his glamorous partner, Agent 99. The show was a massive hit in the 1960s, running for five seasons and earning multiple Emmy Awards.

Henry's influence on American cinema extended far beyond his work on "Get Smart," however. He also co-wrote, with Calder Willingham, the screenplay for the classic 1967 film "The Graduate," which starred Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. The film is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, and Henry's writing and dialogue played a significant role in its success.

In addition to his work on "Get Smart" and "The Graduate," Henry was also known for his appearances on-screen. He appeared in several memorable supporting roles in films throughout his career, including "The Last Detail" and "Heaven Can Wait." He also hosted "Saturday Night Live" several times in the show's early years, cementing his status as a comedy icon.

In a statement, Henry's wife, Irene Ramp, said that her husband "loved writing and was always working," up until the time of his death. She added, "He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather, and a loyal friend to many. He will be deeply missed."

Buck Henry's contribution to American comedy and entertainment cannot be overstated. He was a master of his craft and will be remembered fondly by fans of television and film the world over.
