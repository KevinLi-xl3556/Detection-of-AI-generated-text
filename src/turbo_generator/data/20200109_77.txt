On February 9th, the Oscars will take place without a host for the second consecutive year. This decision was made after comedian Kevin Hart stepped down as host in 2019 due to controversial past tweets. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has since announced that they would not replace him, and the show would be run by various presenters.

After last year's success with this format, the Academy has chosen to give it another try. The show's producers are taking a collaborative approach to the event, with each presenter taking on their own responsibilities to make the show entertaining for the audience.

This year's presenters include some of Hollywood's biggest names, such as Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, and Kristen Wiig. They will be joined by a number of other presenters, including some of the nominees, to cover the various categories throughout the night.

However, not having a host does have its downsides. Without a single person to carry the show and provide witty commentary, there is a risk that the event will not be as entertaining for the viewers. Additionally, having a host helps to create continuity throughout the evening, which could be lost without one.

Despite this shortcoming, many people have expressed excitement about not having a host for this year's show. It provides a unique opportunity for presenters to showcase their individual styles and personalities, making the event more unpredictable and entertaining than ever before.

In the end, the decision to not have a host for the Oscars in 2020 will prove to be a bold choice. It will be fascinating to see how the presenters will take on their roles and make the night a success. Whether it will be well received by critics and audiences remains to be seen, but there is no doubt that it will be a night full of surprises and drama.
