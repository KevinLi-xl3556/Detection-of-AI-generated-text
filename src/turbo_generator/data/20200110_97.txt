Justin Bieber’s Flavorless Pivot to R&B, and 10 More New Songs - The New York Times

Justin Bieber has always been a pop sensation, but with the release of his sixth studio album "Justice," he seems to be trying to pivot his sound towards R&B. Unfortunately, this shift in musical direction doesn't quite hit the mark.

The album's opening track, "2 Much," has a groovy R&B beat but falls flat with lyrics that feel clichéd and lacking in depth. Similarly, the song "Peaches," featuring Daniel Caesar and Giveon, falls prey to trite lyrics that are far from groundbreaking.

Another issue with "Justice" is that Bieber seems to be catering to current trends in music, rather than creating something truly unique. Songs like "Hold On" and "Off My Face" feel like attempts to mimic the sound of Billie Eilish and The Weeknd, respectively.

While there are a few standout tracks on the album, such as "Loved By You" featuring Burna Boy, overall, "Justice" feels like a lackluster attempt at reinvention.

Fortunately, there are plenty of other new songs that are worth checking out. Here are a few:

1. "Leave The Door Open" by Silk Sonic - This track, featuring Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars, is a catchy throwback to 70s R&B.

2. "Plastic Hearts" by Miley Cyrus - Cyrus continues to prove her versatility, delivering a strong rock-infused title track from her latest album.

3. "Jealousy, Jealousy" by Olivia Rodrigo - Following the massive success of "Drivers License," Rodrigo shows off her songwriting chops with this introspective track about social media and comparison.

4. "929" by Halsey - The singer gets deeply personal on this track about her journey to success, with lyrics that are both haunting and relatable.

5. "Follow You" by Imagine Dragons - This upbeat track is the perfect combination of catchy pop and fun rock, with a memorable chorus that will have you singing along.

Overall, while Justin Bieber's attempt at a musical pivot might not have been entirely successful, there are plenty of other new songs to enjoy. From old favorites like Imagine Dragons to breakout stars like Olivia Rodrigo, there's something for everyone.
