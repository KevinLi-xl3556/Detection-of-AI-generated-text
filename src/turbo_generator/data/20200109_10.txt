In 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, with one of its main objectives being to expand Medicaid health coverage to low-income Americans. Over a decade later, many states have expanded their Medicaid programs and decreased the uninsured rate among their populations. However, certain states, such as Kansas, have not yet made the move to expand Medicaid. That may soon change.

Kansas' efforts to expand Medicaid have been met with major obstacles, including opposition from former Republican Governor Sam Brownback, resistance from the state legislature, and legal challenges. But now, under the leadership of Democratic Governor Laura Kelly, Kansas is poised to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly 130,000 low-income residents.

The plan is simple: Kansas would expand Medicaid coverage to people with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. This would expand the program to include adults who earn up to $17,775 a year and parents who earn up to $32,319 a year. This expansion would be funded mostly by the federal government, with the state contributing 10% of the cost.

The benefits of expanding Medicaid are clear. It would provide health coverage to thousands of low-income Kansans who desperately need it. It would also lower healthcare costs for everyone by reducing emergency room visits and uncompensated care. Research has shown that states that have expanded Medicaid have lowered their uninsured rates and saved money on healthcare costs.

Moreover, expanding Medicaid would provide an economic boost to Kansas. It would create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue. A 2019 report from the Kansas Hospital Association estimated that expanding Medicaid would create over 13,000 jobs and inject nearly $3 billion into the state's economy by 2028.

Despite the clear benefits, Kansas' efforts to expand Medicaid have been fraught with political hurdles. In 2017, the state legislature passed a bill that would have expanded Medicaid, only for it to be vetoed by then-Governor Brownback. Following Brownback's departure, the state legislature once again passed a Medicaid expansion bill in 2019. However, the bill was vetoed by Governor Kelly's predecessor, Jeff Colyer.

Now, with Governor Kelly in office, Kansas seems poised to finally expand Medicaid. The governor has made expanding healthcare coverage a top priority and has been working with lawmakers to pass a bill that would make it a reality. In March 2021, the Kansas House of Representatives passed a Medicaid expansion bill, and it now awaits action in the state Senate.

Although there are still hurdles to overcome, expanding Medicaid in Kansas is closer than ever to becoming a reality. The benefits are clear: improved health outcomes for low-income Kansans, lower healthcare costs for everyone, and a boost to the state's economy. It's time for Kansas lawmakers to put politics aside and do what's best for their constituents by expanding Medicaid.
