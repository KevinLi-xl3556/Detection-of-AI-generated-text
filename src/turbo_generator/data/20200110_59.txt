The New York Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Semyon Bychkov reunited for a program of works by Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, and Prokofiev at David Geffen Hall on Thursday evening. The performance was the first time the two had worked together since 1985, and the audience seemed to relish the renewed collaboration.

The concert began with Tchaikovsky's "Symphony No. 5." Bychkov brought out the best in the orchestra, creating a lush and passionate rendition of the renowned work. The sweeping melodies of the first and second movements were executed with precision and feeling, and the "waltz" of the third movement was played with exuberance.

Next on the program was Shostakovich's "Cello Concerto No. 1," featuring soloist Truls Mørk. Mørk's performance was exceptional, delivering a powerful and expressive interpretation of the work. Bychkov and the orchestra were sensitive accompanists, working in tandem with the cellist to create a captivating and emotionally charged performance.

The final work on the program was Prokofiev's "Symphony No. 6." Bychkov and the orchestra played with focused intensity, creating a visceral and dynamic atmosphere. The work's somber and melancholic moments were balanced with moments of defiant energy, resulting in a performance that was both astute and emotional.

Throughout the concert, Bychkov and the orchestra exhibited a fine-tuned understanding of each other's strengths. Bychkov's expressive conducting style and attention to detail allowed the orchestra to shine, while the orchestra's technical prowess and emotional depth provided Bychkov with fertile ground to explore.

In a poignant moment, Bychkov dedicated the performance to the late conductor and former music director of the New York Philharmonic, Kurt Masur. Masur was a mentor to Bychkov and a beloved figure in the orchestra's history, and his legacy was palpable in the evening's program.

Overall, the performance was a resounding success, showcasing the best of both the New York Philharmonic and Semyon Bychkov. The reunion of these two musical powerhouses was a memorable occasion, leaving the audience with a stirring and inspiring musical experience.
