How Forced Labor in Eritrea Is Linked to E.U.-Funded Projects

The New York Times - Eritrea, a small country located on the eastern coast of Africa, has been plagued by accusations of human rights abuses for years. Among the most alarming is the use of forced labor, which has been linked to E.U.-funded projects in the country.

The Eritrean government has been accused of relying on a system of forced labor to execute large-scale public works projects, such as roads and buildings, as well as to complete military service obligations. A United Nations report released in 2015 revealed that “systematic, widespread and gross” human rights violations, including forced labor, were taking place in Eritrea.

In response to these allegations, the European Union has suspended funding for several Eritrean projects, including a large-scale road construction initiative. However, critics argue that the E.U. should go further and take a more proactive role in ensuring that their funds are not being used to support human rights abuses.

The road project, which was partly funded by the E.U., was reportedly constructed with the help of forced labor. According to an investigation by The New York Times, conscripts and prisoners were forced to work on the road, enduring harsh conditions and receiving little to no compensation for their labor.

Eritrea’s system of forced labor is tied to the national military service program, which requires all citizens over 18 to serve for an indefinite period. Many conscripts are sent to work on public projects or for private companies, where they are subject to abuse, exploitation, and forced labor.

The Eritrean government has denied allegations of forced labor and human rights abuses, presenting military service as a necessary obligation for national defense.

The E.U. has long been a major donor to Eritrea, providing substantial aid for development projects aimed at improving the country’s infrastructure, education system, and healthcare sector. However, critics argue that these projects are being executed with little oversight or accountability, allowing the Eritrean government to continue using forced labor with impunity.

Human rights organizations have called on the E.U. to take stronger action to combat forced labor in Eritrea. This includes halting funding for projects with known or suspected ties to human rights abuses, as well as working with Eritrean civil society groups to promote human rights and accountability.

As the E.U. continues to grapple with its role in supporting development projects in Eritrea, it must take a more proactive stance against the use of forced labor. By holding the Eritrean government accountable for its human rights abuses and ensuring that aid funding is not being used to support these abuses, the E.U. can make progress towards promoting human rights and development in this small but troubled country.
