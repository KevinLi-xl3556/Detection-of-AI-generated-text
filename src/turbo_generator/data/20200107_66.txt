On Tuesday, December 4th, 2018, prosecutors for the United States Department of Justice asked the judge presiding over the Michael Flynn case to sentence the former national security adviser to prison time for lying to the FBI.

This request comes after Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the former Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak. Flynn’s sentencing has been delayed multiple times, as he has cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In a 13-page sentencing memo submitted to the federal court in Washington, D.C., prosecutors argued that Flynn’s “false statements were intentional and calculated” and “undermine[d] the FBI’s ability to investigate and detect violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.” They also noted that Flynn’s extensive military and government service did not exempt him from being held accountable for his actions.

The memo also described Flynn as a prominent public figure who had used his “privileged access to classified information to benefit foreign nationals” and had made public statements “casting doubt on the unanimous assessment of the intelligence community regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.” The prosecutors argued that a sentence of probation would not be sufficient punishment for his offenses.

Flynn’s lawyers have until December 11th to respond to the memo. In the past, they have argued that Flynn was not aware that lying to the FBI was illegal when he made his false statements, and that he was driven to do so by the pressures of the investigation.

The sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn is scheduled for December 18th. It remains to be seen what sentence he will receive, but the prosecutors’ request for prison time demonstrates their commitment to holding him accountable for his actions, regardless of his past service to the country.
