On Monday, January 6th, mourners began to gather in the streets of Iran to pay their respects to Qassim Suleimani, the top Iranian general who was recently killed by a United States drone strike. Suleimani was seen as a hero among many Iranians, and his death has sparked widespread mourning and anger throughout the country.

The funeral marches, which began in Ahvaz, Suleimani's hometown, have drawn enormous crowds of Iranians who are mourning the general's passing. Many have been seen weeping openly and chanting slogans in support of Suleimani and the Iranian government. The processions have been organized by the Iranian government and have been attended by high-level officials, including members of Iran's military and political leadership.

While the funeral processions have been peaceful so far, tensions remain high between Iran and the United States following the assassination of Suleimani. The Iranian government has vowed to retaliate for the killing, and in recent days, it has taken steps to increase its military presence in the region. The United States, meanwhile, has signaled that it is willing to use force to protect its interests in the Middle East.

Despite these tensions, however, the funeral marches have provided an opportunity for Iranians to come together and pay their respects to one of their country's most iconic figures. Suleimani was widely seen as a patriotic and courageous military leader who was deeply committed to protecting Iranian interests in the region. His death has left many Iranians feeling that their country has lost a revered and important leader.

The funeral marches are expected to continue in the coming days, with the procession ultimately culminating in Tehran, where Suleimani will be buried. It remains to be seen how long the mourning period will last in Iran, and what impact Suleimani's death will have on the country's political and military landscape. But for now, as mourners continue to pack the streets to pay tribute to their fallen hero, it is clear that Suleimani's legacy will long be remembered by Iranians, both at home and abroad.
