Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking immunity from corruption charges, weeks before the country's general election. This move comes after facing criminal charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in three separate cases.

The Prime Minister is requesting immunity from prosecution, which would prevent him from being charged while he remains in office. Netanyahuâ€™s request is the first of its kind in Israeli history.

Many are speaking out against the Prime Minister's move, touting it as a blatant attempt to avoid being held accountable for his actions. Netanyahu has strongly denied any wrongdoing, claiming the charges are politically motivated.

A rejection of the Prime Minister's request would mean that he will have to face trial in the coming months, which could hugely affect his chances of winning the upcoming election, formerly scheduled for March but recently moved to April.

An official statement from Avigdor Feldman, the Prime Minister's lawyer, stated that the legal proceedings against Netanyahu should not proceed while he remains in office. A decision on the immunity request will be made by the Israeli parliament.

The Prime Minister has been the driving force behind numerous controversial policies, such as the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the annexation of the Golan Heights, and the construction of settlements in the West Bank, all of which have led to international criticism.

Furthermore, the charges against him come amidst reports of corruption allegations against his associates as well. These allegations have led to a rift within the ruling Likud party, with some members openly criticizing Netanyahu and advocating for his ousting.

The move of seeking immunity by the Prime Minister has been met with anger and disappointment by many Israelis who see this as an attempt to avoid being held accountable for his actions. Some believe this move sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the rule of law in the country.

In conclusion, the request for immunity by the Prime Minister has been met with mixed reactions. The move has raised questions about his ability to govern effectively while facing legal charges, and the impact this could have on the upcoming election. The decision on the immunity request now rests with the parliament, and it remains to be seen what implications this would have for the Prime Minister's future.
