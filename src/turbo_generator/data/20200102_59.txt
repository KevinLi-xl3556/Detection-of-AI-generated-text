In 2019, Hollywood got nostalgic with movies like "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" and "The Irishman" taking us back to the golden age of cinema. But as we approach the 2020 Oscars ceremony, the question arises: Will the Oscars get as nostalgic as Hollywood did?

Looking at the nominations, it seems that there is a mix of both modern and old-fashioned films. "Joker," the origin story of Batman's arch-nemesis, is set in the 1980s and gives a nod to classic movies like "Taxi Driver." "1917" takes us back to World War I, a period often romanticized in Hollywood films. "Little Women" is a retelling of a classic novel that has been adapted several times before.

On the other hand, there are films that deal with contemporary issues, such as "Parasite," a South Korean movie that tackles social inequality, and "Jojo Rabbit," a satirical take on Nazi Germany.

Perhaps the real question is not whether the Oscars will be nostalgic, but whether they will be inclusive enough to recognize diverse stories and voices. In recent years, the Academy has faced criticism for its lack of diversity, leading to the #OscarsSoWhite movement. While there are more films by and about people of color this year, such as "Harriet" and "Just Mercy," there is still room for improvement.

The Oscars have always been a reflection of the times, whether it's through groundbreaking films like "Moonlight" or politically charged speeches by winners. This year, the ceremony will take place amidst ongoing debates about representation and inclusion in Hollywood. The question is whether it will rise to the occasion and celebrate the diversity that makes cinema so powerful.

In the end, the Oscars may or may not get as nostalgic as Hollywood did in 2019. But what truly matters is that they recognize and celebrate the films and filmmakers that push boundaries, challenge conventions, and tell stories that resonate with audiences everywhere.
