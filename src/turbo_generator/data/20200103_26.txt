When the news of Qassim Suleimani’s death broke out, it was clear that the United States had just escalated the already heightened tensions with Iran. The killing was undoubtedly a significant event, leading to Iran’s retaliation, which resulted in the accidental downing of a Ukranian passenger plane. However, after the dust has settled, it is now evident that Suleimani’s demise has not caused any significant changes in Iran’s geopolitical landscape.

Iran has survived many crises in the past, including the Iran-Iraq War, strict economic sanctions, and more recently, the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Iran has a robust and resilient political structure and has managed to navigate its way through difficult situations. The current regime is not likely to crumble due to the death of one of its senior leaders, especially when it is under internal and external pressure.

Moreover, Suleimani was not Iran's decision-maker, but rather an influential figure. He held no formal position in the state but was the commander of the Quds Force, a unit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps that oversees Iran's foreign military operations. That does not suggest that the loss of such a vital chess piece was insignificant, but it indicates that the regime can replace its high-ranking officials and continue with its agenda.

Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran's stratagem has been to resist the United States and Israeli hegemony in the region. The state has pursued this agenda through concerted policies, including the deployment of proxies such as Hezbollah, backing of the Syrian government, and supporting the Yemeni Houthi rebels. Suleimani spearheaded these operations and efficiently executed them, but they were not his individual projects—logistic and organizational support came from the state's institutions.

Therefore, despite the symbolic significance of Suleimani's death, Iran's policies and posture are not likely to change. Iran’s hostility towards the United States predates Suleimani, and his death will not spur them to change their policies. Iran will continue to resist the United States' presence in the Middle East, support its foreign allies, and seek regional dominance.

In conclusion, after the initial backlash and tensions that followed Suleimani's death, it is now clear that the event did not trigger any significant changes in Iran's approach to its foreign policies. Iran's political structure and strategy are still intact, and its posture towards the United States will remain constant. Therefore, rather than underestimating Iran's resilience, the United States should re-engage with Iran through diplomatic channels and embark on dialogue that could lead to long-lasting peace instead of triggering deadly confrontations.
