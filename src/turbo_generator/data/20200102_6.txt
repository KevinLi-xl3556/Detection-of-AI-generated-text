David Stern, the former commissioner of the NBA, recently passed away at the age of 77. Stern left behind a legacy that has impacted the sports world more than anyone could have ever imagined. Stern was known for his iron fist when it came to enforcing the league's rules, but he also saw that his job was more about making the league successful.

Under his leadership, the league thrived, and he was instrumental in taking the NBA to a global stage. He had a vision, and he made it his mission to see it through. Stern's stern leadership style was a topic of conversation around the NBA, and many have felt his wrath. Despite this, he will be missed by those who loved him, like those 850 NBA players, whom he made rich.

When Stern took the helm of the NBA in 1984, the league was struggling financially and had a lackluster image. He quickly set out to change that perception, and he succeeded through his strategic thinking and marketing skills. He secured lucrative television deals, sought out new sponsors, and promoted the league in countries around the world. He even helped create the WNBA, the NBA's women's league, which has provided opportunities for female basketball players.

Although the league prospered under Stern's leadership, he was not without his controversies. He was criticized for his handling of the NBA's dress code, which many saw as a way to control the league's predominantly African-American players. He also faced criticism for his handling of the Indiana Pacers-Detroit Pistons "Malice at the Palace" brawl in 2004, which resulted in several players being suspended and losing millions of dollars in salary.

But despite the controversies, Stern's impact on the NBA cannot be overstated. He transformed the league into the thriving business it is today, with teams worth billions of dollars and players earning millions annually. He was a pioneer in the sports world, and his impact will be felt for generations to come.

David Stern will be missed by many, even those who felt his wrath. He was a visionary who brought the NBA to the forefront of the sports world, and his impact on the league is immeasurable. His legacy will continue to inspire future leaders, and the NBA will always remember his influence on the game. Rest in peace, David Stern.
