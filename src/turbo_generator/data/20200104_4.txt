On the 4th of January, a deadly airstrike was carried out in Libya, killing at least 30 people and injuring dozens of others at a military academy in the capital of Tripoli. The attack has been described as one of the deadliest in recent months, and has prompted widespread condemnation from international human rights organizations.

According to reports, the airstrike was carried out by a foreign air force, likely from the United Arab Emirates, who have been linked to previous attacks in Libya. The strike hit the Military Technical College in the Janzour district of Tripoli, where cadets were taking part in a graduation ceremony. The force of the blast caused widespread destruction, and emergency responders are still working to clear the rubble and assess the full extent of the damage.

The Libyan government has condemned the attack in the strongest terms, labeling it a "heinous crime" and calling on the international community to hold those responsible to account. They have also accused the UAE of carrying out the attack, though this has not been confirmed.

Human rights organizations have also spoken out against the attack, with Amnesty International describing it as a "war crime". The organization has called on the UN Security Council to launch an investigation into the incident and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.

The attack comes amid an ongoing conflict in Libya between the internationally recognized government and a rival faction led by General Khalifa Haftar. The conflict has been ongoing since 2014 and has intensified in recent months, with both sides carrying out airstrikes and other attacks on civilian targets.

The international community has been largely divided in their response to the conflict, with some countries backing General Haftar's forces and others supporting the government in Tripoli. The attack on the military academy is likely to further deepen these divisions and fuel the ongoing violence in the country.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is all the more important that we do not forget about the ongoing conflicts and crises that continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the globe. The attack in Libya is a stark reminder of the devastating toll that war and violence can take, and serves as a call to action to work towards a more peaceful and just world.
