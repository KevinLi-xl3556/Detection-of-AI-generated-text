Marian Finucane, one of the most influential voices in Irish radio, passed away at the age of 69. A renowned journalist, broadcaster, and presenter, Finucane contributed significantly to the development of Irish broadcasting, particularly in the area of current affairs.

Finucane began her career as a journalist, working for the Irish Press newspaper in the 1970s, where she covered a range of topics, including politics, social justice, and women's issues. In 1979, she joined RTÉ, the Irish public broadcaster, as a presenter on the Weekend World programme. She went on to present a variety of current affairs programmes, including Women Today, Liveline, and The Marian Finucane Show.

Throughout her career, Finucane was a champion of social justice and equality, using her platform to highlight issues affecting vulnerable members of society. She campaigned for causes such as women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and the rights of people with disabilities, often using her interviews to challenge government ministers and policy makers on these issues.

In addition to her journalism and broadcasting work, Finucane was involved in several charities and campaigns. She served as a board member of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and was a trustee of the World Wildlife Fund (Ireland). She was also a supporter of marriage equality, campaigning for a Yes vote in the 2015 Irish referendum.

Despite her significant achievements, Finucane remained modest and down-to-earth, often referred to as "a national treasure" by her listeners. Her warmth, intelligence, and insight made her a favourite among Irish audiences, and her influence on Irish broadcasting was immeasurable.

In a statement, RTÉ Director-General Dee Forbes said, "Marian was a broadcaster of immense capability; a household name, she was first and foremost, a tenacious journalist with a zeal for breaking new ground. She will be deeply missed by all of us who had the privilege and pleasure of working with her."

Marian Finucane's contribution to Irish broadcasting and society will be remembered for years to come. She leaves behind a legacy that will continue to inspire generations of journalists and broadcasters, and her voice will be sorely missed by her many listeners and admirers.
