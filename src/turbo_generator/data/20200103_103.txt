As a writer, I feel compelled to voice my thoughts and feelings about Martin Scorsese's latest film, 'The Irishman'. While it may be praised for its cinematic excellence and superb storytelling, I cannot help but feel a sense of unease and discomfort after watching it.

As someone who grew up with a stepfather involved in the Irish mob, I was initially excited to see a film that touched on this topic. However, the way in which 'The Irishman' portrays the characters and their actions left me feeling frustrated and disappointed.

My stepfather was not a cartoonish, one-dimensional character that was solely defined by his criminal actions. He was a complex human being who was fiercely protective of his loved ones and actively sought ways to give back to his community. While he may have had his faults and made some choices that were not ideal, his entire being cannot be defined by his criminal past.

Unfortunately, 'The Irishman' perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces negative perceptions of Irish Americans as being brutish, ignorant, and violent. Rather than portraying an accurate depiction of the complexities of the Irish mob, the film instead depicts a caricature of these individuals that does nothing to challenge or subvert harmful stereotypes.

It is frustrating to see a film that is so lauded by critics and audiences fail to accurately portray the lived experiences of those involved in the Irish mob. While 'The Irishman' may be entertaining to watch, it ultimately maligns and dehumanizes those who are involved in this subculture.

As a writer, I urge filmmakers to take greater care in how they depict real-life individuals and communities. The damaging effects of harmful stereotypes and one-dimensional characterizations are far-reaching and can have lasting consequences for those they negatively impact.

In conclusion, I believe that 'The Irishman' fails to accurately and respectfully portray the complexities of the Irish mob, and stands as a frustrating example of harmful stereotypes and misrepresentations.
