According to a recent article published in The New York Times, whole milk may be a better choice when it comes to children's weight.

For years, low-fat and skim milk have been touted as the healthier options for children, with the idea that reducing dietary fat intake leads to lower body weight. However, recent studies have challenged this notion, suggesting that children who consume low-fat dairy products may actually be at a higher risk for obesity.

One study conducted by Dr. Mark DeBoer, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, found that children who consumed whole milk had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who drank skim or low-fat milk. The study analyzed data from over 18,000 children ages 1 to 6 years old, and concluded that whole milk may be a better choice for promoting healthy weight in children.

Why might whole milk be a better option than low-fat or skim milk? One theory is that the fat in whole milk helps to regulate satiety, or the feeling of fullness. When children consume low-fat or skim milk, they may be more likely to feel hungry and eat more calories overall.

Another factor to consider is that many low-fat and skim milk products contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners to improve their taste. These additives can contribute to excess calorie intake, which can ultimately lead to weight gain.

Of course, it's important to note that moderation is key when it comes to any dietary choice. While whole milk may be a better option than low-fat or skim milk for promoting healthy weight in children, it's still important to balance dairy intake with other nutrient-rich foods.

The takeaway from these studies is clear: when it comes to promoting healthy weight in children, whole milk may be a better choice than low-fat or skim milk. By offering children a balanced diet that includes nutrient-rich dairy products, we can help them lay the foundation for lifelong health and wellness.
