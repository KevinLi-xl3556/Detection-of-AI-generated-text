Andrew Yang, the American entrepreneur and presidential candidate, has reportedly raised $16.5 million in the last three months for his 2020 campaign, according to a report by The New York Times.

Yang has been gaining momentum in the race for the Democratic nomination, with his focus on issues such as universal basic income and addressing the impact of automation on the workforce. His fundraising numbers are a testament to his growing support.

As reported by The New York Times, the fundraising numbers for Yang's campaign are a significant boost from earlier in the year when he faced challenges in raising funds. The campaign's third-quarter haul of $16.5 million could give Yang an edge in the coming months.

Some of Yang's most significant supporters have been members of the tech industry, as his focus on the impact of automation on the economy resonates with these individuals. His message of a universal basic income, which proposes to give every citizen a stipend to help support them financially, has also gained attention.

The fundraising numbers for Yang's campaign come at a time when the Democratic field is narrowing. Yang has outlasted some of his fellow candidates who have already dropped out of the race, including Kamala Harris and Beto O'Rourke.

It remains to be seen how Yang will fare in the primaries and caucuses that will kick off the nominating process next year. However, his fundraising numbers show that his message is resonating with voters and supporters.

Overall, Andrew Yang's fundraising success demonstrates that his campaign is gaining traction as we approach the primary season. His message has resonated with many Americans, and his ongoing engagement with voters will be essential in attracting more supporters in the coming months.
