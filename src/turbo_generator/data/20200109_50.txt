"What Students Are Saying About 2020, Growing Up in Another Era, and Distraction"

The year 2020 has brought forth many changes to our daily lives. From the pandemic and its effects on education to the rise in social activism and political unrest, this year has proven to be a turning point for many. Amidst it all, students are trying to navigate through these changes while also trying to grow up in an era vastly different from the one their parents experienced. The New York Times recently asked students from around the country to share their thoughts on 2020, growing up in another era, and the challenge of distraction.

Firstly, students expressed their frustration with the constant distractions they face on a daily basis. With social media and technology a driving force in their lives, it becomes all too easy to lose focus on their studies or get caught up in the latest trends. Students recognize the need to balance their use of technology with their responsibilities, but it remains a challenge. "I feel like as a teenager, it's just in our nature to be distracted," said one high school student from California. "It's something we have to work through and try to limit."

For many students, the pandemic has brought forth feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. The shift to online learning has disrupted their routines and made it difficult to stay motivated. Some students expressed worry about the future and how this experience will impact their lives in the long run. Despite these challenges, there is a sense of resilience and determination amongst students to push through and adapt to the changes.

Another theme that emerged was the idea of growing up in a different era from their parents. The current generation of students has access to more information and technology than any other before them, which has both positive and negative effects. On one hand, students have a greater understanding and awareness of the world around them. On the other hand, they also face new and unique challenges that their parents may not have experienced. "I feel like our generation has a lot more awareness and exposure to different things," said a high school student from Ohio. "But at the same time, it's like we're navigating through uncharted waters."

Finally, students shared their thoughts on the events of 2020 and the impact it has had on them. The rise in social activism and racial justice movements have created a sense of hope and drive for change amongst students. They recognize the importance of taking action and standing up for what they believe in. However, the constant barrage of negative news can also take a toll on their mental health. For some students, finding a balance between staying informed and protecting their mental health remains a challenge.

In conclusion, students are navigating through a rapidly changing world filled with distractions, uncertainty, and a desire for change. They are facing new and unique challenges, but also display a sense of resilience and determination. As we move forward into the future, it's important to listen to the voices of the younger generation and understand their perspectives on the world around us. Only then can we hope to create a better tomorrow for all.
