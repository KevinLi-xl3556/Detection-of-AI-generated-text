Today's Friday briefing covers three major events happening across the world â€“ Iran's missile attack on US bases in Iraq, the Ukrainian airliner crash in Iran, and the Taiwan elections.

Starting with Iran's missile attack, tensions have been high between the US and Iran for months, and this attack was a direct response to the US's killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike earlier this month. The attack was launched on two major US military bases in Iraq, with reports indicating that there were no US casualties. However, there were still fears of retaliation and escalation of violence. The situation is still developing, and the world is watching closely.

In a tragic turn of events, a Ukrainian Airlines Boeing 737 crashed just hours after Iran's missile attack, killing all 176 people onboard. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but it's suspected that it was brought down by a missile fired by Iranian forces. This has led to further outrage and protests in Iran, with citizens demanding accountability and answers from their government. The international community is offering condolences to families and loved ones of the victims.

Lastly, Taiwan held its presidential elections on Saturday, with the incumbent Tsai Ing-wen winning by a landslide. This is seen as a significant victory for Tsai and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, as it sends a strong message to China, which claims Taiwan as its territory. The elections were closely watched by the international community, especially given China's growing influence in the region and its ongoing trade war with the US.

Overall, these events highlight the volatile global political climate, with tensions escalating between major powers and the potential for further instability. The world is still processing the outcomes and implications of these events, and it remains to be seen how they will impact the international community in the coming weeks and months.
