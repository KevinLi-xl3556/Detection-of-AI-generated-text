In a recent announcement, Tesla reported record output for the third quarter of the year. This achievement comes as a major victory for CEO Elon Musk who had set a goal to produce 500,000 vehicles annually for the company. This milestone was finally reached after several years of hard work and dedication from the Tesla team.

The company produced 145,000 vehicles in the third quarter of 2020, which is a significant increase compared to the previous year. This was due to a combination of factors, including the opening of the company's new factory in Shanghai, China, which helped to boost production in the region. Additionally, the company's Fremont factory in California resumed operations after a brief shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase in production has also helped to reduce the company's expenses and increase its overall profitability. This is a crucial development for Tesla, which has struggled to achieve profitability in past years due to high manufacturing costs and low sales numbers.

In a recent statement, Musk expressed his enthusiasm for the company's growth, stating that "I'm extremely proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone. When we started Tesla 16 years ago, there were only a handful of people who believed in us. Now, we are one of the most valuable companies in the world and we are still growing fast."

The company's success has also been reflected in its stock price, which has soared in recent months. This is a testament to the confidence that investors have in Tesla's future growth and prospects.

Looking ahead, Tesla has a number of ambitious plans for the future, including the launch of their new Model Y SUV, the Cybertruck, and the development of self-driving technology. With its recent success and a visionary CEO at the helm, it seems likely that Tesla will continue to change the automotive industry and redefine what it means to be an innovative and forward-thinking company.
