Bollywood has been known for its masala films with larger-than-life characters, bright colors, vibrant songs and dances, but with "Ghost Stories," the Indian film industry ventures into the horror genre.

Released on Netflix on January 1, 2020, "Ghost Stories" is an anthology movie consisting of four spine-chilling tales directed by four of India's most notable directors: Karan Johar, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee, and Anurag Kashyap. The directors have had previous successes in the industry, and their talents come together to make this collaboration one of the most anticipated movies of 2020.

The movie starts with a cautionary message appealing to viewers to watch the movie in complete darkness and with headphones to enhance the overall experience. Indeed, the directors' choice of the genre as well as the screenplay goes beyond the traditional jump scares and instead focuses on the psychological aspects of horror.

The first story, directed by Karan Johar, is titled "The Ghost Bride," which features a newlywed couple moving into a big mansion. The story's opening sets the tone of the overall narrative, with its dark, ominous atmosphere and an unnerving background score. As they start settling, the bride starts experiencing malevolent supernatural entities. The use of shadows, lighting, and camera angles adds an element of intrigue to the narrative, making it all the more spine-chilling.

The second story, directed by Zoya Akhtar, is called "Lust," which narrates the story of a nurse who takes care of an ailing woman who is kept locked inside a room. The nurse starts to notice strange things happening in the house leading to the revelation of horrific events that took place in the past. This story delves into the genre of psychological horror and is terrifying in its own way.

Dibakar Banerjee's "Unleash" is the third story, which is about a professor named Avinash, who starts experiencing the presence of a ghost in his house. The story is different from the rest and provides a unique perspective that shows the ghost turning the tables on the protagonist in an unexpected way.

Anurag Kashyap's "Trigger Warning" is the final story, and it revolves around a pregnant woman and a newly married couple that find themselves trapped in a ghostly realm of their own making. The story is a perfect blend of physical and psychological horror, and its unpredictable twists keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

Overall, "Ghost Stories" is a display of exceptional talent, and the directors showcase their prowess by scaring the viewers in unusual ways. The performers' performances are outstanding, with actors like Janhvi Kapoor, Sobhita Dhulipala, and Mrunal Thakur delivering strong performances, adding credibility to the storyline.

While the movie may not cater to the taste of all audiences, this is an impressive effort by Bollywood to try something new and attempt to scare the audiences. "Ghost Stories" is perfect for fans of the horror genre who are looking for something that goes beyond cheap thrills and jump scares. It is a commendable effort that is worth every minute of its runtime.
