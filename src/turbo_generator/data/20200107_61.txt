The Lord of the Rings, 2020 and Stuffed Oreos: Read the Andrew Bosworth Memo

In a recent memo, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's head of hardware, addressed the social network's polarizing role in modern society, comparing it to the "one ring" in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga.

Bosworth's memo, which was leaked to the media, acknowledges Facebook's power to connect people and foster communities, yet highlights the potential for abuse, such as the platform's role in spreading misinformation and amplifying extremist views.

Looking ahead to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Bosworth warns that Facebook must remain vigilant in preventing interference, particularly from foreign entities, and ensuring that its algorithms don't dictate what people see and share.

But amidst the serious tone of the memo, there's a surprising mention of Stuffed Oreos, a product that may seem unrelated to Facebook's mission. Bosworth suggests that as they work towards improving the platform, the team should take a break and indulge in a little whimsy.

It's easy to dismiss Bosworth's call for Stuffed Oreos and levity as a distraction from the gravity of Facebook's impact on society. Yet, it's worth noting that The Lord of the Rings, a story about the corrosive nature of power and the need for moral leaders to resist corruption, is also a work that celebrates the joy of fellowship and the beauty of nature.

Perhaps Bosworth's memo is a reminder that while Facebook has tremendous power to shape our world, it's still a platform made by people who need a break to enjoy simple pleasures like Stuffed Oreos. It's also a call to keep perspective on the challenges of preventing the "one ring" from corrupting our society, while acknowledging that fellowship and humor can also help us resist temptation.
