Into The Dark: Puerto Rico After the Earthquake

The New York Times, January 15, 2020

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — As the sun sets over the Caribbean Sea, thousands of people in Puerto Rico are still without electricity, water, or shelter more than two weeks after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the island. The quake, which followed several smaller ones, killed at least two people, injured dozens, and damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings, including schools, hospitals, and homes.

The disaster has exposed the vulnerability and resilience of Puerto Ricans, who are still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017, which caused more than $90 billion in damage and claimed an estimated 3,000 lives, mostly due to the lack of basic services such as electricity and healthcare. Since then, the island has struggled to rebuild its infrastructure, economy, and political stability amid a debt crisis and a contentious relationship with the United States government, which controls many aspects of its governance and funding.

The earthquake has amplified those challenges, as well as new ones, such as the fear of more quakes and aftershocks, the shortage of supplies and resources, the communication and coordination problems among agencies and leaders, and the psychological toll on the affected communities, who feel abandoned and forgotten.

"We are still in a state of emergency, but we are also in a state of hope and solidarity," said Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, who gained national attention for her outspoken criticism of the Trump administration's response to Maria. "We are not alone, and we are not afraid. We are Puerto Ricans, and we will rise again."

However, the road to recovery is long and uncertain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has pledged to provide financial assistance and disaster relief, but many Puerto Ricans are skeptical of its effectiveness and integrity, especially given the recent scandals and controversies involving the agency's response to previous disasters in different parts of the country, such as the delayed and inadequate aid to Hurricane Maria survivors.

"We cannot rely on FEMA alone, or on any other external force, to solve our problems," said Edgardo Miranda-Rodríguez, a Puerto Rican artist and activist who has been helping to distribute supplies and resources to the affected communities. "We need to look within ourselves, and to each other, for the strength and resources we need to survive and thrive."

That spirit of resilience and solidarity has been evident in many parts of the island, where volunteers and organizations have been working tirelessly to provide relief and support to those in need. From cooking and delivering meals to clearing debris and setting up shelters, these grassroots efforts have shown the power of community and compassion in times of crisis.

"We have seen the worst of nature, but we have also seen the best of humanity," said José Andrés, the acclaimed chef and founder of World Central Kitchen, a non-profit organization that has served more than 150,000 meals to Puerto Ricans affected by the earthquake. "Food is not only nourishment, but also love and hope. We are here for you, Puerto Rico."

As the night falls, the darkness is broken by the light of candles, flashlights, and cell phones, as people gather in the streets, parks, and plazas, to share stories, songs, and prayers. The sound of drums and guitars echoes through the humid air, expressing the passion and resilience of Puerto Rican culture. The stars twinkle above, offering a glimpse of the beauty and wonder of the universe. The future may be uncertain, but the present is alive with the spirit of Puerto Rico.

"We may be shaken, but we are not broken," said Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican singer and actor who has been advocating for more aid and awareness of the earthquake's impact. "We need your help, your compassion, your voice. We need you to tell the world that Puerto Rico is not a colony, not a foreign land, but a part of America and humanity. We need you to stand with us, into the dark, and beyond."
