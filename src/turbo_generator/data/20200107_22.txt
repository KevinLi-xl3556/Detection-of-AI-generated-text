The United States and France are currently racing to conclude digital tax talks, amidst the threat of tariffs on French goods. The negotiations are aimed at resolving a long-standing dispute over how to tax digital companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook that rely on local markets but pay little in taxes.

The negotiations, which are being facilitated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), have been ongoing for more than a year. But they have been complicated by disagreements between the United States and France over how to tax companies that rely on local markets but don't have a physical presence there.

France has been pushing for a tax on digital services that would affect companies with revenues of at least 750 million euros ($847 million) worldwide and 25 million euros ($28 million) in France. The United States, however, opposes such a tax, arguing that it unfairly targets American companies.

The dispute has worsened in recent months, with the United States threatening to impose tariffs on French goods worth up to $2.4 billion in retaliation for the digital tax. France, in turn, has warned that it would respond in kind, raising fears of a wider trade war between the two countries.

Both sides have expressed a willingness to reach a compromise, however. In January, the United States and France agreed to a truce, deferring any tariffs until December 2020 to give negotiators time to work out a deal.

Since then, negotiations have intensified, with both sides exchanging proposals and engaging in high-level talks. But with just a few months left until the December deadline, time is running out.

The potential consequences of failing to reach an agreement are significant. A breakdown in negotiations could lead to the imposition of tariffs, which would harm businesses and consumers in both countries. It could also set a dangerous precedent, by eroding the principles of free trade and fair competition that underpin the global economy.

Despite the challenges facing negotiators, there are some reasons for optimism. Both sides have shown a willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue, and there are signs that they are making progress on key issues.

The French government, for example, recently indicated that it is willing to accept a lower threshold for the digital tax, which could help to address American concerns. The United States, for its part, has proposed a new framework for taxing digital companies that could be more palatable to France.

Ultimately, the success of the negotiations will depend on the willingness of both sides to compromise. If they can find a way to bridge their differences, they could pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable tax system that benefits all countries, not just a select few. But if they fail, the consequences could be dire.
