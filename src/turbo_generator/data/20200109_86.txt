‘Like a Boss’ Review: Tiffany & Rose’s Very Unfortunate Adventure - The New York Times

‘Like a Boss’ is a comedy film directed by Miguel Arteta, that follows the lives of two best friends, Tiffany (Rose Byrne) and Rose (Salma Hayek), as they navigate the ups and downs of running their small cosmetics business.

The story begins with Tiffany and Rose struggling to keep their business afloat, with bills piling up and a looming deadline to pay back their loans. Enter the wealthy and successful makeup mogul, Claire Luna (played by the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge), who offers to invest in their company and help it expand.

Tiffany and Rose are ecstatic, but as soon as Luna comes into the picture, everything starts to go downhill. Luna wants full control of their business, and her demands become increasingly ridiculous as the movie progresses. What follows is a series of mishaps and misfortunes that ultimately lead to the dissolution of Tiffany and Rose's friendship.

One of the standout performances in the movie is Salma Hayek's portrayal of the aggressive and controlling Claire Luna. She delivers her lines with such conviction and humor, making her presence on screen impossible to miss. Rose Byrne also gives a noteworthy performance as the more reserved and level-headed Tiffany, who tries her best to keep the business and her friendship with Rose intact.

However, despite the strong performances and some genuinely funny moments, ‘Like a Boss’ falls short in some aspects. The plot is predictable and lacks the depth and originality that would keep audiences engaged from start to finish. While the movie aims to be empowering and inspiring, it falls into the trap of presenting women as catty and competitive towards each other, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Overall, ‘Like a Boss’ is an enjoyable movie that delivers some good laughs and memorable performances, but ultimately fails to leave a lasting impact. It's definitely worth a watch for its entertaining value, but don't expect it to be a game-changer in the world of comedy films.

In conclusion, if you're in the mood for a light-hearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, ‘Like a Boss’ is definitely worth a watch. However, if you're looking for something that's fresh and original, you might want to give this one a miss.
