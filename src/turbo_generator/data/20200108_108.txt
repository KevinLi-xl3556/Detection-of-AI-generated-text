Military Kids Change School Up to 9 Times. So Let's Make It Easier.

For many children, moving to a new school can be a daunting experience. But for military kids, changing schools is a routine part of life. According to a report by the Military Child Education Coalition, military families will move on average six to nine times during a child's education, which can be a challenging and disruptive experience. 

Military families, who constantly relocate for their country, need support from the community to ensure that their kids are able to seamlessly transition to new schools. Many military kids have to cope with the new surroundings, make new friends, and adjust to new academic challenges each time they move.

While the transient nature of military life can be exciting, it also brings many challenges that can affect the education of military children. Studies have shown that military children are at a greater disadvantage academically than their civilian peers, due to changing schools and curriculum gaps. 

Additionally, military-dependent students often do not receive the same academic and social-emotional support when transitioning to new schools compared to other students. This can result in a negative impact on academic performance and overall well-being.

In response, there are steps that schools and communities can take to make the transition easier for military children. It is important for schools to reach out to military families and offer resources such as counseling, tutoring, peer support groups and social events. These types of programs provide the necessary support and sense of community that military kids need during frequently occurring transitions.

Additionally, schools can ensure that military children's records are transferred quickly and there is continuity in terms of academic credit, graduation requirements and eligibility for extracurricular activities. States can also facilitate a more uniform transfer of records and academic credit across inter-state boundaries.

Another solution is to implement measures to make it easier for military families to stay together. One idea is to consider the geography of military bases when developing school catchment areas. This would allow military children to attend the same schools as their siblings and friends, promoting social cohesion and a sense of belonging.

It is important to recognize and support the sacrifices of military families by ensuring their children have access to quality education no matter where they live. By providing comprehensive support, we can ensure that military kids can thrive in different schools and communities, and not just survive. 

We all owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women who serve our country, and by extension, their familes. Let us honor them by supporting policies and programs that ease the burden of this unique experience. Let us make it easier for military kids to transition to new schools so that they can focus on learning and achieving their full potential.
