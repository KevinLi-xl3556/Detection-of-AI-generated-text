As Americans, we have a shared responsibility to protect and defend our country. While this is an admirable goal, the process of who actually signs up to fight in the military is not without its issues.

Recently, The New York Times released an article titled "Who Signs Up to Fight? Makeup of U.S. Recruits Shows Glaring Disparity". The article detailed the glaring differences in the demographic makeup of those who choose to join the military.

One of the most significant disparities noted was the difference in education levels. According to the article, "The share of recruits with no more than a high school diploma is now 79 percent, compared with 75 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in 2005." This statistic is concerning as it suggests that those with higher levels of education may not see the military as a viable option.

Another concerning disparity highlighted in the report is the racial composition of those who choose to serve. The article revealed that black Americans make up just 16 percent of the recruit population, compared to their 26 percent share of young adults nationwide. Meanwhile, white Americans make up 55 percent of recruits but only 50 percent of young adults.

When examining these disparities, it's important to consider the reasons behind them. One explanation for the education gap may be a lack of access to college for many low-income individuals in our country. They may see the military as a way to gain skills and alternative education options.

The race disparity is more complex and likely results from various factors such as systemic racism or higher rates of poverty in minority communities. It's worth noting that these discrepancies are not new and have been a topic of discussion for years.

Ultimately, it's important to ensure that our military is made up of a diverse and representative group of individuals. When only certain segments of the population choose to serve, it can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy among troops, which can have a detrimental impact on our military readiness and overall national security.

Thankfully, there are efforts in place to address these disparities, such as recruitment programs aimed at historically underrepresented groups. It's crucial that we continue to assess and address these disparities to ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity to serve their country and contribute to our national defense.
