On January 3, 2020, President Donald Trump authorized a drone strike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qasem Soleimani, at Baghdad International Airport. The strike escalated tensions between the United States and Iran and prompted a retaliation from Iran in the form of missile strikes on two Iraqi air bases housing American troops.

In the aftermath of the attack, Trump made several public statements justifying his decision to target Soleimani. One statement, in particular, caught the attention of many: Trump claimed that Soleimani was planning to attack four U.S. embassies, including the embassy in Baghdad.

In an interview with Fox News, Trump said, "I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies. You know, Baghdad certainly would have been the lead, but I think it would have been four embassies, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent, and then all of a sudden he was gone."

The claim that four embassies were targeted by Iran immediately raised questions among journalists and politicians. No other official intelligence report had mentioned any such plan and the administration had failed to provide any evidence to support Trump's claim. Some wondered whether the president had made up the claim to justify the strike on Soleimani.

The New York Times conducted an investigation into the matter and found that Trump's claim was inconsistent with the information presented during classified briefings to members of Congress. According to the article, "lawmakers said that they were not presented with specific, tangible evidence indicating that Iran was planning to attack four embassies."

The article also highlighted the confusion within the administration regarding the intelligence on the supposed embassy attack plans. When asked about the matter, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that he had not seen any specific evidence that backed Trump's claim. On the other hand, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that the threat was "imminent" and justified the strike on Soleimani.

As tensions between the U.S. and Iran continue to simmer, the controversy over Trump's claim about the embassy attacks has not died down. Critics argue that Trump's statements have made it difficult to discern what is fact and fiction and have undermined the credibility of U.S. intelligence agencies. Some have called for Congress to investigate the matter further to determine whether Trump acted appropriately in ordering the strike on Soleimani.

In the end, the claim that four embassies were targeted by Iran remains a point of contention between the administration and the public. Only time will tell whether it was made in error or if it was a deliberate attempt to manipulate the narrative surrounding the decision to take out Soleimani.
