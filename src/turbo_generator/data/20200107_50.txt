On Saturday, January 4th, two Milwaukee children were shot after reportedly throwing snowballs at passing cars. The incident occurred around 7:45 p.m. on the 6100 block of North 28th Street.

According to Milwaukee police, a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy were throwing snowballs at passing vehicles when they hit a white Toyota. The driver of the vehicle then allegedly pulled out a gun and fired several shots at the children, striking both of them.

The children were transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The 13-year-old boy was shot in the leg and the 12-year-old girl was grazed by a bullet.

The driver of the Toyota fled the scene and as of Monday, January 6th, no arrests had been made in connection with the incident. The Milwaukee Police Department is currently investigating the shooting.

This incident has understandably horrified the community, sparking outrage and disbelief that such violence could occur in response to a harmless, albeit mischievous, childhood activity. Many are left wondering what could drive someone to take such extreme measures.

Mayor Tom Barrett, in an interview with CBS 58, condemned the incident, stating, "This is obviously a situation where there's no place for guns, and certainly no place for guns to be used in that manner."

The Milwaukee Police Department has urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them immediately.

This incident serves as a sobering reminder of the ongoing issue of gun violence in Milwaukee and across the country. While the circumstances surrounding this incident are still under investigation, it is clear that much work needs to be done to address the root causes of gun violence and to prevent events like this from occurring in the future.
