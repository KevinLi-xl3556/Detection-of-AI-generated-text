Qassim Suleimani, the slain Iranian major general, was known for his masterful strategies and cunning plans in building Iran’s Shiite axis of power in the Middle East. But who was he and how did he become such a formidable figure in Iran’s military and political circles?

Born in 1957 in the eastern region of Iran, Suleimani grew up in a poor family and joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. He quickly rose through the ranks and became the commander of the elite Quds Force in 1998, which is responsible for Iran's operations abroad, especially in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Afghanistan.

Suleimani's role in building Iran’s axis of power in the Middle East began to emerge after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. His ability to work with Shiite groups in Iraq, including the powerful militia group, the Mahdi Army, helped shape the political and military landscape in Iraq. This allowed Iran to gain influence and leverage in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. 

Suleimani was also instrumental in the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. He coordinated the efforts of various Shiite militias, Syrian government forces, and Russian air power in defeating the extremist group. This victory further cemented Iran’s influence in the region and brought Suleimani into the spotlight as a hero and a master strategist.

But Suleimani's success in building Iran’s Shiite axis of power did not come without controversy. He was accused of supporting brutal crackdowns against protesters in Iran, as well as the killing of American troops in Iraq through his support of Shiite militias.

Suleimani’s death in a U.S. drone strike in January 2020 was a blow to Iran’s influence in the region and a loss of a key figure in Iran’s military and political establishment. His death also heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, leading to fears of a wider conflict.

In conclusion, Qassim Suleimani was a master of intrigue and a key figure in building Iran’s Shiite axis of power in the Middle East. His death was a significant loss for Iran and highlighted the complexities and challenges of the region. It remains to be seen how his successors will navigate these challenges and maintain Iran’s influence in the region.
