Altadena, a small town located in the hills above the cities of Pasadena and Los Angeles, is often overlooked by travelers when exploring the Los Angeles area. However, what Altadena lacks in tourist attractions, it makes up for in natural beauty and a rich history.

One of the main reasons to visit Altadena is for its open spaces. The town is bordered by the San Gabriel Mountains and Angeles National Forest, providing ample opportunities for hiking, camping, and picnicking. For those who prefer a more leisurely outdoor experience, there are several parks within Altadena, including Loma Alta Park, which offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains.

Altadena is also home to several historic landmarks, including the Altadena Library, which was built in 1929 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Cobb Estate, also known as the Haunted Forest, is a former estate that is said to be haunted and is popular for its hiking trails and beautiful gardens.

Another must-see in Altadena is the Mount Lowe Railway, which was in operation from 1893 to 1938 and carried passengers up Mount Lowe for breathtaking views of Los Angeles. Although the railway is no longer in operation, visitors can still hike the trail and see the remains of the railway and the resort that was once at the top of the mountain.

Altadena is also home to a vibrant arts community, with several galleries and art studios scattered throughout the town. The Altadena Farmers’ Market, which is held every Wednesday, offers fresh produce and handmade goods from local vendors.

Overall, Altadena offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, with its natural beauty and rich history. Whether you’re an outdoor enthusiast, history buff, or art lover, Altadena has something to offer.
