On October 26th, Johnson & Johnson was sued by the state of New Mexico, adding to the mounting legal challenges facing the company over their beloved baby powder.

This is not the first time the company has been challenged in the courtroom over claims that their talc-based product contains dangerous asbestos fibers. In fact, Johnson & Johnson has been accused of this on numerous occasions in recent years, leading to billions of dollars in legal settlements.

But the lawsuit from New Mexico takes a different approach. Rather than accusing the company of directly causing harm to consumers, the state is suing Johnson & Johnson for its alleged role in creating a public health crisis.

According to the lawsuit, Johnson & Johnson has known for decades that their baby powder is potentially contaminated with asbestos, yet they continued to market it as safe and beneficial for use on infants and adults alike. This, the state argues, amounts to a deliberate attempt to deceive the public about the risks associated with the product.

The lawsuit also claims that Johnson & Johnson's conduct has led to an increased number of cancers and other health problems in New Mexico, including mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. The state is seeking monetary damages to help cover the costs associated with treating these conditions, as well as injunctions to prevent the company from continuing to market and sell products that may contain asbestos.

Johnson & Johnson, of course, disputes these claims. In a statement to the New York Times, a spokesperson for the company said that they were "confident" in the safety of their baby powder and that they would "vigorously defend" themselves against the lawsuit.

But in a climate where consumers are increasingly skeptical of big corporations and their claims about the safety of their products, it remains to be seen who the public will side with in this ongoing legal battle. Johnson & Johnson has built its reputation over more than a century, but as more information comes to light about the potential dangers of their signature product, that reputation may be increasingly fragile.
