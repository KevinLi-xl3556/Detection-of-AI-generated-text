In recent years, the world has been witness to several instances of civilian planes being mistakenly or intentionally shot down, leading to tragic loss of innocent lives. These incidents have left us with a grim history that cannot be forgotten.

One of the most horrific incidents of civilian planes being shot down occurred in 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a missile over eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers and crew members on board were killed. Investigations revealed that the missile was fired by pro-Russian separatists using a weapon provided by Russia. The incident led to an international outcry, with demands for justice and accountability.

Another instance of civilian planes being shot down took place in 1983 when Korean Air Flight 007 was shot down by Soviet Union fighter jets while flying over restricted Soviet airspace. The incident was a result of a communication error, as the flight crew had unintentionally strayed into prohibited airspace. All 269 people on board, including 61 American citizens, were tragically killed.

Closer home, India too has faced its share of such incidents. In 1999, Indian Airlines Flight 814 was hijacked by terrorists and taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan. In the aftermath of the incident, the Indian government agreed to release three terrorists in exchange for the passengers being released. However, one passenger was killed during the hijacking, and another died after being released.

More recently, in 2019, tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bombing attack on Indian paramilitary forces in Kashmir. In the aftermath of the attack, India conducted air strikes on a terrorist camp in Pakistan. Pakistan retaliated by launching air strikes into India, and in the ensuing confusion, a civilian plane was mistakenly shot down by the Pakistani military, killing all on board.

These incidents remind us of the importance of maintaining proper communication and coordination between countries and avoiding the use of violence in conflict situations. Civilians should never be targeted or caught in the crossfire, and it is the responsibility of nations to safeguard the lives of their citizens and those of other nations.

In conclusion, the history of civilian planes being shot down is a grim reminder of the devastation that can be caused by misguided actions and poor communication. The world needs to come together to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future and that proper measures are taken to prevent them. We owe it to the victims of such incidents to work towards a more peaceful and safer world.
