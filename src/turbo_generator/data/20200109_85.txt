As the United States nears the end of Donald Trump's first term, and the 2020 presidential election looming on the horizon, many Democrats are grappling with a crucial question: which path should the party take in order to win back the White House? 

The answer to this question is far from straightforward, as Democrats must navigate a number of complex factors in order to secure victory. While many of the country's more progressive voters are calling for a radical shake-up of the party's establishment, others believe that the key to success lies in a more pragmatic approach. 

One strategy that has been suggested involves doubling down on the party's progressive base. Many on the left argue that a shift towards the political center played a significant role in Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in 2016, and that the key to victory in 2020 lies in energizing the more progressive wing of the party. This would involve embracing bold policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, which would appeal to a younger generation of voters who are skeptical of the status quo. 

Others argue that the key to victory lies in capturing moderate voters. The 2018 midterm elections saw a number of moderate Democrats, including Conor Lamb and Abigail Spanberger, win in traditionally red districts, suggesting that a more centrist approach could be the key to flipping swing states. This would involve appealing to traditional Democratic voters who may have been put off by the party's more progressive stance, and crafting a message that speaks to disillusioned voters who may have stayed home in 2016. 

Ultimately, the answer to this question may boil down to which candidate the party chooses to run in 2020. Some of the leading contenders, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have already embraced a more progressive platform, while others, like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, have been more reticent to adopt such policies. The key will be finding a candidate who can energize the party's base while also appealing to voters in key swing states. 

As the road to the 2020 election continues to unfold, it is clear that the Democratic party must carefully consider its options in order to secure victory in the coming years. Whether through a renewed focus on progressive policies or a more pragmatic approach, the party must continue to evolve and adapt in order to meet the challenges of a rapidly-changing political landscape.
