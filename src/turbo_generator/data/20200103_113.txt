New in Paperback: ‘The Schoolhouse Gate’ and ‘Ghost Wall’

The New York Times has recently announced the paperback release of two remarkable books, ‘The Schoolhouse Gate’ and ‘Ghost Wall’.

Penned by renowned author Justin Driver, ‘The Schoolhouse Gate’ is a compelling read which delves deep into the history and complexity of the United States Supreme Court's decisions on educational inequality. With evocative prose, Driver takes the reader on a journey through the decades, uncovering the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and how these have been tested in the context of education. Spanning from the Civil War era to the present day, ‘The Schoolhouse Gate’ is a wide-ranging, illuminating examination of one of the most pressing issues in American society today.

Sarah Moss’ ‘Ghost Wall’ is a haunting and introspective novel, fusing contemporary and ancient storytelling techniques in a narrative that is both mesmerizing and visceral. The story follows Silvie, a young woman whose family has agreed to join an archaeological reenactment of an Iron Age settlement in Northumberland. As Silvie and her family are forced to confront the brutal realities of life in a traditional, patriarchal society, the novel’s themes are deftly woven into the story, including the issues of gender norms, toxic masculinity, and the corrosive influence of history. Moss’ writing is an excellent command of language, and her use of imagery is all-consuming, making ‘Ghost Wall’ the kind of book that stays with readers long after the last page is turned.

Both books have received widespread critical acclaim for their exceptional writing, deep insight into complex issues, and powerful storytelling that leaves a lasting impact on the reader.

With their paperback release, ‘The Schoolhouse Gate’ and ‘Ghost Wall’ are poised to become essential additions to any book lover's collection. We highly encourage everyone to get their hands on both of these exceptional titles today.
