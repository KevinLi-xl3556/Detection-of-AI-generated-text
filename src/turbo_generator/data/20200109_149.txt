For decades, the case of the Knapp family's murder has been one of the most perplexing unsolved crimes in American history. On April 11, 1906, John and Hannah Knapp, their son Herman, and their maid, Bridget Durgan, were found brutally murdered in their home in West Virginia. The killer had left no trace and the case went cold for over a century.

But recently, new evidence has emerged that sheds light on the case and points to a possible culprit. In 2019, a descendant of the Knapp family, Candace Foster, hired a team of investigators to examine the case afresh. The team uncovered new documents and historical records that suggest the likely killer was a man named Joseph Mays, a neighbor and former business partner of John Knapp.

Mays, a notorious bootlegger, had a long-standing feud with Knapp over a business deal gone sour. He had reportedly threatened Knapp in the past and was seen in the vicinity of the Knapp home on the day of the murder. Moreover, one of his employees, a man named William "Red" Snyder, had fled the area soon after the murder and was later found to have committed suicide.

The investigators also found that Mays had a criminal record and had been involved in several other murders and robberies in the area. They concluded that he had a motive and the means to carry out the crime, and that Snyder may have been his accomplice.

The discovery of this new evidence has reopened the debate about the Knapp family's murder and raised questions about why Mays was never charged with the crime. Some speculate that there may have been a cover-up by corrupt officials or that Mays had powerful allies who protected him from the law.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that the Knapp family's murder was a heinous crime that has haunted their descendants and the local community for over a century. The discovery of new evidence may not bring closure to the case, but it does give us a better understanding of what happened on that fateful day in 1906 and who may have been responsible.

As we reflect on this tragic event, we must remember that justice is not always easy to come by and that it is up to us to keep searching for the truth even when the trail has gone cold. Who killed the Knapp family may never be fully resolved, but we owe it to the victims and their families to keep seeking answers and to never forget this terrible crime.
