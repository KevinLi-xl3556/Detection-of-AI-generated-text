Fran Drescher, the actress and writer best known for her iconic role in the hit television show "The Nanny," is now making her mark on Broadway. According to a recent article in The New York Times, Drescher is developing a musical version of "The Nanny" for Broadway audiences.

"The Nanny" originally aired on television from 1993 to 1999 and became a beloved sitcom for many viewers. The show followed Fran Fine, a cosmetics saleswoman from Queens, who becomes the nanny for the wealthy Sheffield family. Drescher, who co-created and starred in the show, quickly became a household name with her unique voice and style.

The musical version of "The Nanny" is still in the early stages of development, but Drescher has announced that she will be co-writing the show's book with her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson. The two were married for 21 years and created "The Nanny" together.

In addition to the book, the musical will feature original music by Rachel Bloom, the creator and star of "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend." Drescher has expressed excitement for Bloom's involvement in the project, saying that "her style is very musical theater and she writes incredibly clever lyrics that are both funny and heartfelt."

Fans of "The Nanny" can expect to hear some familiar tunes in the musical, including the show's theme song, "The Nanny Named Fran." Drescher has stated that the show will also explore some of the characters' backstories and offer a deeper look into their lives.

While no official casting announcements have been made yet, Drescher has hinted that she might make an appearance in the show. "I'm certainly not opposed to it," she said.

The musical adaptation of "The Nanny" is just one example of the recent trend of turning popular television shows and movies into musicals for the stage. Other recent adaptations include "Mean Girls," "Frozen," and "The Prom."

For fans of "The Nanny," the announcement of a musical adaptation is exciting news. The show's blend of comedy and heart made it a fan favorite during its original run, and the musical version has the potential to capture that same magic for a new generation of audiences.
