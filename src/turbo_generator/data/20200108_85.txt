On January 8th, 2021, a shooting in Ottawa left one person dead and at least three injured in what authorities are calling a "targeted" attack. The New York Times reports that the shooting occurred at approximately 7:30 pm in a residential neighborhood of the Canadian capital.

According to Ottawa police, the shooting took place in a parking lot where a number of people were gathered. The shooter, who has not yet been identified, drove up to the group and opened fire before fleeing the scene in a vehicle. The victims were taken to area hospitals, where one was pronounced dead and three others were treated for injuries.

Police have been tight-lipped about the possible motive for the shooting, but have stressed that it was not a random act of violence. "We believe this was a targeted attack," said Ottawa police Chief Peter Sloly at a press conference.

The shooting has sparked outrage among Ottawa residents, many of whom took to social media to express their shock and sadness. In a statement, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson condemned the shooting as a "cowardly act of violence" and pledged to work with police to bring the perpetrators to justice.

The incident is the latest in a string of shootings that have rocked Canada in recent years, including a deadly attack on a Quebec City mosque in 2017 and a mass shooting in Nova Scotia in 2020 that left 22 people dead. The Ottawa shooting also comes amid heightened tensions in the United States, where a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol on January 6th.

As authorities continue to investigate the Ottawa shooting, many Canadians are left wondering how such acts of violence can be prevented in the future. In the meantime, residents of the affected neighborhood are mourning the loss of one of their own and wishing a speedy recovery for the injured victims.
