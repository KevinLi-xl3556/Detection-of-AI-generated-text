What if Children Ran the School Lunchroom? 

The idea of allowing students to take charge of their school lunchroom may sound far-fetched, but it is not that unusual of a concept. The New York Times published an article titled "What if Children Ran the School Lunchroom?" and it poses an interesting approach to improve the quality of school lunches.

For many years, students have voiced their concerns about the quality of food served in school cafeterias. Complaints range from the lack of variety to the unappetizing appearance and taste of the food. These concerns have led to calls for healthier menu options and the inclusion of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Some schools have taken steps to address these concerns by partnering with local farmers and procuring farm-fresh ingredients for their lunch program. But what if students played a more active role in the school lunchroom? Could they improve the quality of food served?

To answer this question, the New York Times surveyed a group of elementary school students and asked them about what they would do if they were in charge of the lunchroom. The answers ranged from serving pizza every day to offering more vegetables and fruits. But one common thread was the idea of giving students a say in what was served.

This idea is not new, as some schools have already implemented programs that allow students to vote on menu items for the week. These programs empower students to make choices about their food, resulting in a greater interest in trying new foods and making healthier choices.

But what if students went beyond just voting for menu items? What if they also took part in the preparation and cooking of their meals? This approach would not only improve the quality of food but also teach valuable life skills, such as cooking and nutrition.

Of course, it would not be practical to have students cooking lunch by themselves. Instead, schools could partner with local chefs or nutrition experts to teach students about healthy meal preparation techniques. This partnership would allow students to gain hands-on experience in the kitchen while also learning about the importance of healthy food choices.

Overall, the idea of giving students more control over their school lunchroom is a promising one. It not only addresses concerns about the quality of food being served but also empowers students to take an active role in their own health and wellbeing. Schools that implement such programs will likely see an increase in student engagement and a greater sense of community in the lunchroom.
