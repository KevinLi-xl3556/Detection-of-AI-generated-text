It’s no secret that Jordan Peele’s newest horror film, “Us,” has gained plenty of buzz since its release. The imagery of the haunting tethered clones has quickly become iconic. But there’s another aspect of the film that’s caught the attention of fashion-conscious audiences: the T-shirts worn by the Wilson family.

From the first scene of the film, the family’s matching “Thriller” T-shirts immediately conjure up memories of Michael Jackson’s iconic music video. As the film progresses, we see the characters wearing a variety of graphic tees with phrases like “Howard University” and “Frisbee Golf Pro Tour.” These shirts serve not only as a fashion statement, but also as a way to reveal the characters’ personalities and interests.

But it’s not just the Wilson family’s shirts that tell a story. The T-shirts worn by the film’s antagonists, the tethered, are also significant. The group is seen wearing red jumpsuits that are clearly symbolic of the oppressed working class. But it’s their T-shirts that truly reveal the darker side of their existences. The clones wear simple white T-shirts with the logo of Hands Across America – a real-life charity event from 1986, in which millions of Americans formed a human chain across the country to raise money for hunger and homelessness. The image of the clones, dressed in their identical shirts, standing in a line and holding hands in solidarity is both eerie and disconcerting.

The use of T-shirts in “Us” is reminiscent of other films that have used clothing as a subtle form of storytelling. In Wes Anderson’s “The Royal Tenenbaums,” each character’s unique wardrobe serves to reflect their personality and quirks. In the classic teen film “The Breakfast Club,” the characters’ attire is used to signify their respective cliques: the jock, the nerd, the popular girl, the rebel, and the outcast.

It’s clear that the use of T-shirts in “Us” is not accidental. Peele, who is known for imbuing his films with social commentary, is purposeful in his choice of clothing. The use of the Hands Across America logo, for example, can be seen as a commentary on the history of social movements in America – a reminder that even the best-intentioned efforts can have unintended consequences.

The T-shirts in “Us” may seem like a small detail, but they are a powerful tool for storytelling. They provide us with clues about the characters and their motivations, and add an extra layer of meaning to an already complex and thought-provoking film. As we continue to analyze and unpack the themes of “Us,” let’s not forget to pay attention to the details – even if they’re as seemingly insignificant as a T-shirt.
