As the 2020 presidential election draws closer, the Democratic Party is faced with a crucial decision: which path will lead them to victory? With a crowded field of candidates vying for the party's nomination, Democrats must decide whether to lean towards progressive policies or adopt a more moderate approach. The answer may determine who will become the next President of the United States.

On one side, there are candidates like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who are championing progressive policies such as Medicare for All and free college tuition. These policies may resonate with the younger generation, who are facing mounting debt and are struggling to make ends meet. However, such proposals could alienate moderate voters who are wary of a government takeover of healthcare and education.

On the other hand, candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are positioning themselves as centrist candidates who promise to restore political stability and unite a deeply divided country. Such candidates may appeal to independent voters who are disillusioned with politics and yearn for a return to the status quo. However, their policies may not inspire enthusiasm and fail to energize the progressive base of the party.

It's a delicate balancing act for Democrats, who must win over a diverse set of voters dispersed across the country. As demographics shift and traditional battleground states now lean either Democratic or Republican, Democrats must broaden their appeal and capture voters in new areas.

One thing is for certain: Democrats need to find a candidate who can energize voters and bring about change. The 2016 election was evidence that simply being anti-Trump is not enough. Democrats need a bold vision that can inspire people to head to the polls and vote.

Ultimately, it may not be a matter of choosing between progressive and moderate policies. Instead, the Democratic Party needs a candidate who can offer a nuanced approach, one that addresses the concerns of both wings of the party. As the race heats up, Democrats must choose wisely, or risk another four years of Trump's administration.
