Bernie Sanders, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, has announced that he raised an impressive $34.5 million in the final quarter of 2019, making it the largest fund-raising quarter for any Democratic candidate so far.

The Vermont senator's announcement on Thursday is likely to fuel his campaign, marking a major milestone ahead of the Iowa caucuses on February 3. Sanders said that the donations came from over 1.8 million donors who contributed an average of $18.53.

Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir said that Sanders’ recent surge in donations came on the back of strong grassroots support from people who want to see big changes in America, including the complete overhaul of the healthcare system.

Sanders is known for championing Medicare For All in the United States, as part of a plan to provide free healthcare to Americans. The candidate argues that this is necessary to provide access to quality healthcare to every citizen in the country, saying healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.

Sanders’ fundraising success is unprecedented in terms of the volume and variety of contributions. Small donors, including unions, grassroots organizations and individuals, were instrumental in supporting Sanders’ latest fundraising campaign.

The latest figures from the Sanders campaign shows that the Vermont lawmaker raised more donations than any other candidate during the last quarter. This is a reflection of Sanders' broad support, ranging from progressives and socialists on the left, to regular Democrats who admire his determination to address issues such as income inequality and climate change.

With $34.5 million raised in the fourth quarter, Sanders can now start the year with an impressive financial war chest. This is a clear indication of the energy and strength behind the Sanders campaign, leaving his opponents trailing behind.

However, the fundraising success is only part of the story. The Iowa caucuses will be the true test for the senator, as he seeks to secure delegates and establish his candidacy as a serious contender for the Democratic nomination. 

As the election campaign heats up, Sanders’ rivals will be closely watching his every move. But, with a war chest full of donations from individual citizens who believe in his message, the senator is sure to make an even bigger impact in the coming months.
