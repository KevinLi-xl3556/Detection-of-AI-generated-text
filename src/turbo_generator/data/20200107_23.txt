On Wednesday, April 28th, 2021, tragedy struck in New York City as two pedestrians were killed in separate accidents involving a sanitation truck and a concrete truck.

The first incident occurred just before 7am in Queens, when a 42-year-old woman was struck by a sanitation truck as she was crossing the street. The truck, operated by a private company hired by the city, was turning onto a one-way street when it hit the victim. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

Less than four hours later, another pedestrian was killed in a similar accident in Brooklyn. A 37-year-old man was crossing the street when he was hit by a concrete truck at the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U. The driver of the truck remained on the scene, and the victim was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

These two tragic incidents highlight the dangers that pedestrians face in New York City every day. Despite efforts to improve safety measures and reduce traffic fatalities, pedestrians continue to be at risk on the city's busy streets.

According to data from the New York City Department of Transportation, there were 118 pedestrian fatalities in 2019, the most recent year for which statistics are available. This represents a 30% decrease from 2013, when the Vision Zero initiative was launched to eliminate traffic deaths in the city, but there is still much work to be done.

In response to these recent incidents, city officials have called for increased enforcement of traffic laws and stronger safety measures for pedestrians. Councilmember Antonio Reynoso, who represents the district where the Queens accident occurred, said in a statement, "We must prioritize the safety of pedestrians and cyclists on our streets, and hold reckless drivers accountable for their actions."

Mayor Bill de Blasio also expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and stressed the need for greater vigilance on the part of drivers. "We cannot accept senseless loss of life on our streets," he said. "Drivers must take responsibility for their actions and be extra cautious when sharing the road with pedestrians."

As a city, we must do more to protect the safety of all those who travel on our streets. This means investing in infrastructure improvements, increasing education and awareness campaigns, and holding drivers accountable for their actions. All New Yorkers deserve the right to travel safely, whether on foot, on bike, or in a vehicle, and we must work tirelessly to ensure that this becomes a reality.
