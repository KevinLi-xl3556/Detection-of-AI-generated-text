If you’re looking for a fast-paced, action-packed underwater adventure movie, “Underwater” might seem like a promising pick. Directed by William Eubank and starring Kristen Stewart, the movie follows a team of researchers in an underwater laboratory as they fight for their survival against a deadly threat.

However, while “Underwater” boasts some impressive visuals and intense sequences, it ultimately falls short due to its lack of character development and shaky plot.

The film opens with a jolt as the main character, mechanical engineer Norah Price (Kristen Stewart), tries to escape from her rapidly flooding underwater lab. She joins the remaining members of her team, including the captain (Vincent Cassel), another engineer (Mamoudou Athie), a biologist (T.J. Miller), and a researcher (Jessica Henwick), as they try to navigate their way to safety.

The underwater scenes in “Underwater” are visually stunning, creating a sense of claustrophobia and danger as the characters struggle to navigate the murky waters. The special effects are top-notch, making the sea creatures and other hazards they face seem terrifyingly real.

However, that’s where the excitement comes to a halt. While the characters are in constant peril, there’s little time or effort devoted to fleshing them out. We hardly get to know them, and their backstories are barely touched upon, which makes it difficult to care about their ultimate fate.

The plot, too, is murky and often feels like a muddled mess. The story is full of holes, and the pacing is uneven, with some scenes feeling rushed and others dragging on. While the overall narrative is straightforward enough, it lacks the depth and complexity that could have made it truly compelling.

Stewart does a decent job as Norah, managing to convey fear and determination even as her character is given little in the way of backstory or development. She’s a capable action hero, but the movie often falls back on clichés and predictable tropes.

“Underwater” does manage to deliver some thrills and chills, but it’s ultimately a forgettable and underwhelming entry in the genre. Its few strengths are overshadowed by its many weaknesses, and it’s unlikely to make much of a splash with audiences.
