As Britain takes steps to regulate its art trade, art collectors and dealers will now be required to carry identification to buy or sell artwork worth more than €10,000.

The new regulations, which came into effect on June 10th, are part of a broader crackdown on money laundering and the proceeds of crime. The move comes in response to mounting pressure from international organizations, including the Financial Action Task Force, to regulate the art market.

The art market is notoriously opaque when it comes to transactions, making it an attractive target for laundering illicit funds. Money can easily be moved through the purchase of expensive art pieces that can be easily transported and kept out of sight.

Under the new regulations, dealers will be required to carry out customer due diligence (CDD) procedures when handling art transactions that exceed the €10,000 threshold. This will involve collecting information on the customer, verifying their identity and assessing the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.

If dealers identify any suspicious activity, they may be required to report their suspicions to the authorities. Failure to do so could lead to criminal sanctions and fines.

The new regulations have been met with mixed reactions from the art industry. Some dealers argue that the increased bureaucracy and expense will make it harder for legitimate collectors to buy and sell art, particularly for those who are not regular art market players.

Others argue that the regulations are necessary to tackle the problem of money laundering and make the art market more transparent. They argue that the new rules will help to restore confidence in the market and ensure that it remains a legitimate and credible part of the global economy.

Regardless of the views of the industry, the new regulations are now in force and dealers will need to adapt accordingly. They may need to invest in new systems and processes to ensure that they are compliant with the new rules.

Ultimately, the move to regulate the art market is a positive step towards creating a more transparent and accountable art industry. This will help to protect both buyers and sellers, and ensure that the art market remains a vital part of the cultural and economic landscape.
