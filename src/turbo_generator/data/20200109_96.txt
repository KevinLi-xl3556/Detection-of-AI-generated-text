Books have the power to shape our thoughts, emotions, and perspectives. They can transport us to different worlds, introduce us to new ideas and beliefs, and inspire us to take action.

Many of us have a book that has impacted our lives in a significant way. It might have been a novel that helped us escape a difficult reality, a memoir that taught us empathy, or a self-help book that provided guidance during a challenging time.

The question is, which book changed your life? We want to hear about it.

The New York Times is inviting readers to share their personal experiences of how a book transformed their lives. The submissions will be featured in an upcoming series about the power of reading.

Why is it important to share these stories? For one, it shows others that they are not alone in their love for literature. It also highlights the diversity of books that can have a profound impact on readers.

Reading can be a solitary activity, but sharing our experiences with others can create a sense of community and connection. By sharing stories of life-changing books, we can inspire others to pick up a book and possibly change their lives in the process.

So, take a moment to reflect on a book that has impacted your life. What was it about the book that moved you? How did it change the way you see the world?

We encourage you to share your story with The New York Times and be part of a community of readers who have been transformed by the power of words.
