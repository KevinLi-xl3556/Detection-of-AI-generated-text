As the impending presidential election draws near, it becomes clear that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as our commander in chief. His actions during his presidency and his statements prior to his time in office demonstrate that he lacks the necessary qualities to successfully lead the United States.

Since his election in 2016, Trump's behavior has been erratic and volatile, causing chaos and uncertainty both domestically and internationally. For example, his sudden decision to withdraw troops from Syria in 2019 was widely criticized by military experts and his own advisors. The move ultimately led to the destabilization of the region and the resurgence of the Islamic State in the area.

Trump's statements also show that he lacks the necessary temperament for the presidency. He frequently engages in name-calling and public feuds with political opponents, the media, and foreign leaders. Such behavior is unacceptable for a person in the highest office of the land, as it undermines the authority and respect that the United States historically represents.

Furthermore, Trump’s disdain for facts and reason raises deep concerns about his ability to make important decisions based on evidence and rational thinking. His tweets, statements, and actions are often inconsistent, haphazard, and counterproductive. Trump frequently doubles down on false claims, such as the size of his inauguration crowd, and ignores or dismisses sound scientific data.

Trump’s demagogic style of leadership, where he appeals primarily to the emotions and irrational fears of a specific segment of the electorate, is another reason he is ill-suited for the presidency. It is divisive and contrary to the fundamental principles of democracy. Successful leadership requires a level of inclusivity and respect for all people, regardless of race, gender, religion or politics.

Finally, Trump’s failure to demonstrate basic competence in handling the COVID-19 pandemic crisis is indefensible. His refusal to take responsibility for the widespread loss of life and economic failure has shaken our belief in the capacity of the presidency to lead during times of crisis.

In light of these concerns, it is clear that Donald Trump is not qualified to serve as our commander in chief. Americans deserve a leader who is level-headed, competent, and respectful. We must all vote accordingly in the upcoming election to ensure that our country is in responsible and effective hands.
