As a writer, our ability to perceive the world in a unique and creative way is essential to the craft. However, what happens when we start to look at the world in a different way? Does this mean we have reached the end of our artistic journey? According to a recent interview with The New York Times, this perspective is far from accurate.

In this insightful piece, various writers across different genres, including poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, discuss the impact that new ways of looking at the world have on their writing. They provide valuable insight into the transformative power of perspective and how it can be harnessed to improve one's writing.

For some, changing their outlook on the world is an inevitable part of the writing process. Award-winning poet and professor of English at Boston University, Rosanna Warren, speaks about how her view of the world changed after experiencing a trauma. She said, “When you’re forced to see the world through new eyes, it widens your imagination, and that’s what poets rely on.” The trauma helped her to discover new ways of understanding human suffering, which has enriched her writing.

Similarly, fiction writer Karen Russell believes that writers can benefit from stepping out of their comfort zones and trying to see the world from different perspectives. In her novel "Swamplandia," she writes from the perspective of different characters, some of whom are not human, and this helps to expand the scope of her writing.

This perspective on the transformative power of new perspectives is also endorsed by American novelist, Zadie Smith. She believes that writers can always improve their craft by simply expanding their worldview. Smith says, “I’m finished when I start looking at the world in a different way. Then the work is done.”

In conclusion, it is clear that writers can benefit greatly from stepping out of their comfort zones and discovering new ways of viewing the world. This process may be painful, but ultimately it can lead to richer and more successful writing. By embracing the transformative power of perspective, writers can continue to grow and evolve, advancing their craft to new heights.
