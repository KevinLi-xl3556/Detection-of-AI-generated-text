The divisional round of the N.F.L. playoffs is set to kick off this weekend, with some of the league’s top teams vying for a spot in the Conference Championships.

The New York Times has made its picks for which teams will come out on top in the upcoming games, based on their regular season performances and current form.

In the first game on Saturday, the San Francisco 49ers will host the Minnesota Vikings. Despite being the lower seed, the Vikings come into this game with some momentum after their stunning upset of the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round. However, the 49ers are a force to be reckoned with, boasting one of the best defenses in the league and a dynamic offense headed by quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Our pick: San Francisco 49ers.

The second game on Saturday will see the Baltimore Ravens, the top seed in the AFC, take on the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens have been the most dominant team in the league this season behind the historic play of quarterback Lamar Jackson. The Titans, on the other hand, have relied on their bruising running back Derrick Henry and a stout defense to make it this far. While many expect this game to be a one-sided affair, the Titans could pose a real challenge if they can control the clock and keep Jackson off the field. Our pick: Baltimore Ravens.

On Sunday, the Kansas City Chiefs will host the Houston Texans in what should be a high-scoring affair. The Chiefs, led by superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes, boast one of the most explosive offenses in the league. The Texans, meanwhile, are coming off a thrilling comeback win against the Buffalo Bills in the wild card round. While the Texans have weapons of their own in quarterback Deshaun Watson and wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, it’s hard to see them keeping pace with the high-flying Chiefs. Our pick: Kansas City Chiefs.

The final game of the weekend will see the Green Bay Packers take on the Seattle Seahawks at Lambeau Field. The Packers come into this game with a well-rested squad after earning a bye in the wild card round, while the Seahawks narrowly escaped with a win against the Philadelphia Eagles. Both teams boast strong defenses, but the Packers have the edge on offense behind quarterback Aaron Rodgers and running back Aaron Jones. Our pick: Green Bay Packers.

With so much on the line in these pivotal games, it’s anyone’s guess who will come out on top. But with our picks for this weekend’s games, we think we’ve got a pretty good idea of which teams will advance to the Conference Championships.
