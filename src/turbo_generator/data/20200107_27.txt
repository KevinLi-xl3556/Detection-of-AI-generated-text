The .org domain name has been around since the early days of the internet, providing a non-commercial online space for charities, non-profits, and other organizations. But in recent months, the ownership of .org has become the center of a fierce battle worth billions of dollars.

The nonprofit organization that has managed the .org domain name for the past two decades, the Internet Society, had announced in November 2019 that it would sell the rights to the domain name to the private equity firm Ethos Capital for a whopping $1.1 billion. The announcement took the internet by surprise and sparked immediate opposition from several organizations, including ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), which oversees internet infrastructure.

The sale of .org would mean more than just a windfall for the Internet Society. It would give Ethos Capital control over a vital online resource, which tens of thousands of organizations worldwide have used to build their online presence, communicate with their supporters, and raise funds.

Critics of the sale have pointed out that Ethos Capital is not a typical buyer of online resources, but a private equity firm with no previous experience in managing domain names. Furthermore, given that Ethos Capital is a for-profit entity, there are concerns about its potential conflicts of interest and its ability to raise the price of domain name registration fees, which could have a devastating effect on the nonprofit sector.

Over the past several months, the battle over .org has been waged in various arenas, from blog posts and social media to courtrooms and government agencies. In January 2020, ICANN rejected the sale, stating that it was not in the best interest of the internet community. However, Ethos Capital has not given up on its bid for .org and is pursuing alternative routes to complete the transaction, including challenging ICANN's decision.

The future of .org remains uncertain, but the battle over its ownership has highlighted an important issue that goes beyond a domain name. Nonprofits and charities, which already face challenges in raising funds and communicating with their supporters, are increasingly reliant on online platforms to achieve their goals. The ownership of these platforms and the policies that govern them can have significant consequences for the nonprofit sector and the communities it serves.

As the internet continues to evolve, it is crucial that we pay close attention to who owns and controls its resources and ensure that they are used in the public interest. In the case of .org, it is not just a matter of billions of dollars; it is a matter of upholding the values and principles that underpin the nonprofit sector and the public good.
