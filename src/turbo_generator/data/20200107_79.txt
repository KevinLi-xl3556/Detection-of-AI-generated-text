The 2020 award season is underway, and the nominations for both the Producers Guild Awards (P.G.A.) and Directors Guild Awards (D.G.A.) have been announced. Topping the lists are "Parasite," "1917," and "The Irishman."

"Parasite," directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a critically acclaimed South Korean film that has already received multiple awards and nominations. It tells the story of a low-income family who becomes entangled with a wealthy family in a gripping and suspenseful tale that examines the class divide in modern society. The film received both P.G.A. and D.G.A. nominations, indicating its status as a strong contender for the awards circuit.

"1917," directed by Sam Mendes, is a World War I epic that was shot to look like one continuous take, immersing the viewer in the gripping story of two soldiers on a dangerous mission. The film received a P.G.A. nomination, cementing its place as a top contender for the season.

Finally, "The Irishman," directed by Martin Scorsese, is a Netflix original film that reunites Scorsese with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, alongside a cast that includes Al Pacino. The film, which spans several decades and explores the life of a hitman, has received both P.G.A. and D.G.A. nominations, solidifying its place as a front-runner.

Of course, there were other notable nominees as well. "Joker," "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood," and "Ford v Ferrari" all received P.G.A. nominations, while "Joker" and "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" also received D.G.A. nominations. Interestingly, Greta Gerwig was snubbed for a D.G.A. nomination for her film "Little Women," despite the film's critical acclaim and box office success.

As always, the nominations are just the beginning of the award season, with the winners for both the P.G.A. and D.G.A. Awards being announced on January 18th and January 25th respectively. But with "Parasite," "1917," and "The Irishman" leading the way, it promises to be an exciting season filled with impressive films and talented filmmakers.
