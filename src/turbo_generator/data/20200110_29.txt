Black Britons Wonder What Took Harry and Meghan so Long

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey has sparked a flurry of reactions around the world, including in the United Kingdom, where the couple had been members of the royal family until last year. While many Americans have expressed support for Harry and Meghan's account of racism, mental health struggles, and disillusionment with the royal institution, some British commentators have criticized them for disloyalty, ingratitude, and exaggeration.

Yet amidst the polarized responses, one group that has largely welcomed Harry and Meghan's revelations are Black Britons, who share some of the couple's experiences and frustrations. For them, the interview was a rare and powerful spotlight on the structural and systemic racism that pervades not only the tabloids and the palace, but also the broader society. It was a validation of their long-held suspicions and grievances, and a reminder of the need to dismantle the historical and ongoing inequalities that affect Black people in the UK.

Some Black Britons have expressed surprise and even skepticism that Harry and Meghan stayed as long as they did in the royal family before deciding to step back. As one Twitter user put it, "If Meghan, a non-white woman, couldn't cope with the racism and hypocrisy, what makes anyone think Diana, a white woman, could have handled it?" Diana, Harry's mother, also faced intrusive media coverage and marital problems before her tragic death in 1997, but she never spoke out against the royal family or the press in such a blunt and public way.

Others have noted that Black people in the UK have been warning for decades about the racism they face, but often their voices have been ignored or dismissed as "playing the race card". As a recent report by the UK government's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities claimed, there is no evidence of institutional racism in the country, despite numerous studies that show otherwise. The report has been widely criticized as a whitewashing of the reality faced by Black and minority ethnic people, and as a betrayal of the consultative process and the evidence-based recommendations that were expected.

For Black women in particular, Harry and Meghan's interview resonated deeply with their own struggles to assert their dignity and agency in a society that often stereotypes, fetishizes, or erases them. Meghan, who is biracial and grew up in the US, described how she felt trapped and suicidal because of the isolation, deception, and hostility she faced from some members of the royal family and the media. She also revealed how some unnamed person(s) in the palace had expressed concerns about how "dark" her unborn son's skin would be, and how she and Harry were denied security protection and support for their mental health.

Although some white commentators have dismissed these claims as unfounded or irrelevant, they fail to understand and acknowledge the racial dynamics that shape such incidents. As Reni Eddo-Lodge, a Black British author, wrote in response to the Commission's report, "The problem with insisting that 'race' has nothing to do with how people are treated is that it leaves many people excluded from the debate." The problem with insisting that Harry and Meghan should have kept their 'dirty linen' private is that it silences the voices of those who have been oppressed and disregarded for centuries.

It remains to be seen what consequences, if any, Harry and Meghan's interview will have on the royal family and the media landscape in the UK. Some have called for a boycott of the tabloids that hounded them and other public figures, or for a radical reimagining of the monarchy itself as a more diverse and inclusive institution. Others have criticized Harry and Meghan for their privilege and their association with an elitist and colonialist system that they now claim to reject.

However, what the interview has achieved already is to stir up a much-needed conversation about the realities of racism and mental health, and to challenge the complacency and denialism that still pervade many sectors of the UK. As a Black British woman who watched the interview wrote, "I feel like Meghan spoke for so many of us who are told to just 'get over it' or 'stop playing the victim'. She showed the world that we are not crazy or sensitive, but that we have been gaslit and mistreated for too long." The question now is whether this moment of reckoning will lead to meaningful change, or whether it will be lost in the noise and inertia of a society that prefers to ignore the uncomfortable truths that Harry and Meghan have exposed.
