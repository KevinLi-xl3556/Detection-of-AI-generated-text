Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced their intention to "step back" from their roles as senior members of the royal family on January 8th, 2020. The decision has caused ripples across the world and been the subject of much discussion and conjecture. Here's a look at their announcement and what it means for the couple and the royal family.

Why have Prince Harry and Meghan decided to step back?

In their statement, the couple cited their desire to "carve out a progressive new role within this institution." They explained that they wanted to "balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America" and take on new roles that would allow them to "become financially independent."

The decision comes after increased scrutiny of the couple's private lives by the media and, in particular, following the release of a documentary about their African tour, in which Meghan spoke emotionally about the impact of media coverage on her mental health. It's also worth noting that Prince Harry has always struggled with his role within the royal family and spoken out about his difficulty in finding a place for himself.

What does stepping back mean in practical terms?

The Sussexes have revealed that they plan to split their time between the UK and North America, which means they will no longer be performing royal duties full-time. They will also no longer receive public funds for their official duties, funding themselves through private means instead.

The couple has stated that they will continue to support the Queen and the monarch and have expressed their hope that they can maintain their charitable work. They have indicated that they will be working towards establishing a new charity in the future.

What has the response been?

The response to the announcement has been divided, with some expressing admiration for the couple for following their own path and others critical of the move. There has also been speculation that the announcement came as a surprise to other members of the royal family, including the Queen.

Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, has reportedly expressed concern for his brother's mental health and well-being, while Prince Charles and the Queen are said to be "disappointed" by the announcement. There are fears that the couple's move could damage the image of the royal family and its role within the United Kingdom.

What does this mean for the future of the royal family?

The decision by Prince Harry and Meghan to step back from their royal duties is undoubtedly a significant one, and it remains to be seen what impact it will have on the future of the monarchy. There are already reports that other members of the family could follow in their footsteps and seek a more independent role, but it's important to note that the royal family is an institution that has faced challenges in the past and will no doubt continue to evolve in the future.

For now, many will be watching to see how Prince Harry and Meghan's new chapter unfolds and what their next move will be. While the couple has expressed their hope that they can "start to build a happy and peaceful new life," it's clear that their decision to step back has opened up a new chapter in the history of the royal family.
