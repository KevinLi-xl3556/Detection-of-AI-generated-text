On Friday, January 10th, 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives could send articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate as early as next week. Pelosi had previously delayed sending the articles, citing the need for more information and assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about a fair trial.

The impeachment articles, which charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, were approved by the House in December 2019. However, Pelosi has held off on sending them to the Senate, in an effort to pressure McConnell to agree to call additional witnesses and provide more evidence during the Senate trial.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Pelosi said she would consult with House Democrats before making a final decision on when to send the articles to the Senate. "I'll be talking with my members this week about when they're available to send the articles over," Pelosi said. "We want to see what the process is on the Senate side, and I think that will be soon."

Pelosi's announcement came after new evidence emerged this week, including documents released by House Democrats showing that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was in contact with individuals linked to the Ukrainian government in an effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election. The documents also provide evidence that Giuliani was working at Trump's direction.

The delay in sending the articles to the Senate has sparked criticism from Republicans, who have accused Pelosi of attempting to undermine the impeachment process. However, Democrats argue that they need to ensure a fair trial, and that McConnell has been unwilling to make any commitments regarding witnesses or evidence.

If Pelosi does send the articles to the Senate next week, the Senate trial could begin as soon as next week. However, McConnell has indicated that he plans to pursue a quick trial with minimal witnesses, which could limit the amount of evidence presented.

The impeachment of President Trump is shaping up to be one of the most contentious political battles in recent history. Pelosi's announcement on Friday was just the latest development in a tense and unpredictable process, and it remains to be seen how the Senate trial will unfold in the coming weeks.
