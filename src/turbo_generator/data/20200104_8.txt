In the midst of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India, Muslims across the nation have organized huge protests, challenging the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The New York Times reports that these demonstrations have been marking the largest mobilization of Indian Muslims in decades.

The CAA, passed by Modi's government last December, enables non-Muslims who have entered India illegally from Muslim-majority countries to gain citizenship. This policy has been widely condemned as discriminatory against Muslims and has sparked nationwide outrage.

In response to the CAA, Muslim communities in India have organized massive protests across the country, including in major cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, and the capital, New Delhi. Muslims have been joined in solidarity by other citizens rejecting the notion of religious discrimination within the country.

Though the demonstrations have been primarily peaceful, the sheer scale of these protests has caused concern for authorities. The government has responded to the protests with violent crackdowns, including curfews and internet blackouts in certain areas, and arrests of hundreds of Muslim protesters.

Despite these measures, which some argue are an infringement of basic rights, the Muslim community has continued to stand firm in its fight for religious freedom and equality.

The situation in India has also garnered international attention. The United Nations Human Rights Council and the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom have both expressed concern over the CAA and the response to protests by Indian authorities.

The Muslim community in India has been an integral part of Indian society for centuries. They have significantly contributed to the growth and development of the country across all areas like arts, culture, and business. However, recent policies by the Modi government have left many questioning the future of their place in the country.

In conclusion, the massive protests by Muslims across India, in the face of discriminatory policies, have brought to light the issue of religious freedom and human rights in India. The protests highlight the need for India to prioritize its secular values and respect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their religion or background.
