How to Make Friends Online the Old-Fashioned Way (Buying Clothes Together)

In this digital age, it's becoming increasingly common for people to make friends online. From social media to online communities, the internet has made it easier than ever to connect with people from all over the world. But with so many options, it can be overwhelming to figure out how to make authentic connections. That's where the old-fashioned method of buying clothes together can come in handy.

Shopping is a social activity, one that has been bringing people together for centuries. In a pre-internet era, going to the mall or shopping center with friends was a common pastime. And the act of trying on clothes, giving feedback, and sharing opinions led to closeness and camaraderie. While shopping online removes us from the tactile experiences of trying on clothes and being in a physical space together, there are still ways to bond with new friends over clothing choices.

One way to start is by joining online shopping communities. Websites like ModCloth and ThredUP offer community features where individuals can share their fashion inspirations and tips, and comment on each other's outfits. These communities are great places to begin conversations with like-minded individuals who share a similar fashion sense, as well as get a feel for trends and get inspiration for your own style.

Another option is to go beyond the confines of pre-existing online associations in order to forge new connections. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok offer a wealth of fashion and style inspiration, but can also be used to initiate new friendship connections. For instance, you could leave a comment on someone's outfit post with a compliment or ask where they got a particular piece of clothing. If they respond posiively, you could build a connection from there. The key is to genuinely connect over shared interests.

Once you've made a connection over clothing choices, the next step is to take it offline. It might seem intimidating, but organizing a virtual shopping session with your new friend can be an easy way to take the relationship to the next level. Use video chat software like Skype or Zoom to try on clothes digitally, give each other advice and get feedback in real time. Not only will you get to know each other better, but you'll also have a fun fashion-centric experience to bond over.

While making friends online may seem like it's all about the digital realm, there's still a lot of value in bringing offline traditions like shopping into the mix. By using fashion as a common ground to connect with others, we can create authentic friendships that break through the digital barrier. And who knows? By connecting over shared love of fashion, you might just end up with a lifelong friend.

In conclusion, while there are many ways to make friends online, using fashion as a starting point can be an effective way to build genuine connections. By joining online fashion communities or connecting with others on social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok, fashion lovers can bond over clothing choices, learn new fashion tips, and even organize virtual shopping sessions together. So next time you're scrolling through your favorite fashion blog, consider using it as an opportunity to make a new friend.
