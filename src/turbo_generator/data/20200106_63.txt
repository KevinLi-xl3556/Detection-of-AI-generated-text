The Golden Globes is one of the most prestigious awards given to the best television series and films. With that in mind, one can’t help but eagerly anticipate the winners of the Golden Globes each year. This year was no different, with a lot of extraordinary works being honored by the awards committee. However, alongside the best, there were also a few disappointments. Let's take a closer look at the best and worst of this year's Golden Globes.

The Best

One of the highlights of this year's Golden Globes was "Nomadland" (2020), directed by Chloe Zhao, which won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Drama). The film stars Frances McDormand, who also won the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama). McDormand's performance was outstanding, portraying a woman who embarks on a journey of self-discovery after losing everything.

On the television side, “The Crown” continued to reign. The Netflix historical drama won four awards, including Best Television Series (Drama), Best Actor in a Television Series (Drama) for Josh O’Connor, Best Actress in a Television Series (Drama) for Emma Corrin, and Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series for Gillian Anderson. The series, which chronicles the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, has been a favorite among viewers and critics alike since its debut.

Another standout was John Boyega, who won Best Supporting Actor in any Motion Picture for his role in "Small Axe" (2020). The film directed by Steve McQueen tells the story of West Indian immigrants in London from the 1960s to the 1980s.

The Worst

While the 2021 Golden Globes had its moments of brilliance, it wasn't without its disappointments. Perhaps the biggest shocker of the night was the lack of diversity in the winners. Despite the diverse range of nominees, very few of them won. This raised a lot of questions and criticism about the whole selection process.

As for the awards themselves, the Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy award went to "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" (2020). While the film had its share of humorous moments, it was not exactly the type of movie that is usually associated with the quality of a Golden Globe winner. Many viewers felt that the award should have gone to a more deserving film.

Another less-than-stellar moment was the decision not to allow the Zoom screens of nominees during the telecast. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the awards were held virtually, and this meant that nominees could only join via video calls. However, the decision not to allow the Zoom screens of nominees was a letdown for many, making it feel more like a corporate meeting rather than a glamorous awards ceremony.

In conclusion, the 2021 Golden Globes had its highs and lows, just like any other awards ceremony. Despite the controversies, there were some deserving winners, and some inspiring performances. Nonetheless, the lack of diversity in the winners' circle was a reminder of the work that still needs to be done to increase representation in entertainment. Hopefully, this year's Golden Globes will open the door for more diversity and inclusivity in the future.
