Hate Negative Political Ads? This Is the Primary for You

The New York Times

As the 2020 presidential race heats up, political ads seem to be everywhere, bombarding us with messages that often resort to negative tactics: character attacks, distortions of records, sound bites taken out of context. It’s enough to make even the most dedicated voter tune out.

But there’s good news. In several states, primaries are taking place that offer a refreshing alternative, ones in which candidates are striving to take the high ground, talking about their own records and plans for the future without denigrating others.

One such primary is currently underway in Wisconsin for the state’s 7th Congressional District. During the campaign, candidates have refrained from personal attacks and instead talked about their own accomplishments and goals for the future.

This approach is not only refreshing, it’s also effective. Recent studies have shown that negative ads can actually decrease voter turnout and lead to more negative views of politics in general. When candidates focus on their own message, however, it can have a positive effect on voters, inspiring them to engage with the political process and even vote.

But why is it so difficult for candidates to stick to the high road? One factor may be the pressure to win at all costs. In a tight race, it can be tempting to tear down opponents in order to garner more support. However, this approach can backfire, leading to negative perceptions of both the candidate and the political process as a whole.

Another factor is the influence of outside groups, such as political action committees (PACs), which are not officially affiliated with candidates but often fund attack ads on their behalf. These groups have no interest in playing fair and instead resort to baseless attacks in order to sway voters.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. As voters, we can demand more from our candidates and reject negative campaigning by supporting those who take the high road. By investing in positive messaging and focusing on the issues that matter most to voters, candidates can inspire a more engaged and hopeful electorate.

The Wisconsin primary offers a glimmer of hope in what can often seem like a bleak political landscape. Let’s hope that more candidates take this approach and that voters reward those who do. After all, isn’t it time for a change?
