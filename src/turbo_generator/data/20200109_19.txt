Meet Mary Steenburgen, Songwriter â€“ The New York Times

When you hear the name Mary Steenburgen, you might best associate it with the Academy Award-winning actress known for her work in films like "Melvin and Howard," "Back to the Future III," and "The Help." However, there is another side to this talented woman that is just as noteworthy: her songwriting.

Steenburgen began playing the guitar at the age of 14, but it wasn't until later in life that she began writing her own songs. She has said in interviews that the songs just began to flow out of her, and that she often writes them in a sort of stream-of-consciousness style. According to Steenburgen, writing songs is a deeply personal experience and a way for her to express herself emotionally.

Steenburgen's songwriting has garnered praise from both fans and industry professionals. Her debut album, "American Elegy," was released in 2018 to critical acclaim, with its emotional and poignant songs taking listeners on a journey through personal and societal issues.

Her song "Ghosts of Highway 20" is a haunting reflection on the memories of a past relationship and the sadness of losing touch with that person, while "Burgundy Red" is a beautiful ballad about the simple pleasures of life and love.

Steenburgen's songwriting talent has also caught the attention of Nashville's top songwriters, leading to collaborations with the likes of Brett James and Caitlyn Smith. Steenburgen has even co-written songs with country music legend Willie Nelson.

Despite her success as an actress, Steenburgen has found a certain freedom in songwriting. She has stated that writing music is a way to express herself in a way she can't always do through acting. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she said, "It's just me, and the guitar, and whatever's coming out of me. And I love that."

Steenburgen has proven herself to be a true artist, showcasing her immense talent not only in the film industry, but also in the world of music. With her heartfelt lyrics and beautiful melodies, it's clear that Mary Steenburgen is a force to be reckoned with in both arenas.
