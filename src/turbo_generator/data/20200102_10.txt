Which Subway Seat Is Best? Your Answer Is Obviously Wrong

As New Yorkers, we spend a good portion of our lives on the subway. Rushing to work, running errands, or catching up with friends, the subway is our lifeline to the city. But there's one question that has plagued us all: which subway seat is the best?

Most of us have a go-to seat, whether it's the ones by the door or the ones facing forward. But we often forget that there are pros and cons to each seat, and our choice may not be the best after all.

Let's start with the obvious: the seats by the door. They're easy to get to, especially if you’re running late or carrying a heavy load. But they're also the most crowded, with people constantly getting on and off the train. Plus, they offer limited views of the subway car, making it hard to people-watch or read ads.

Moving on to the seats in the middle of the car, they offer more space and better views. You can see everything happening in the car and enjoy a more comfortable ride. But they're not ideal for getting off at your stop, as you'll have to navigate through a sea of people to get to the door.

The seats facing forward are another popular choice. They offer the best views of the tracks and provide a sense of motion sickness (in a good way). But they also require more effort to get to, as they're located at the end of each car.

Lastly, we have the seats facing backward. They’re often overlooked but they offer some advantages. For one, they're less crowded and provide a quieter ride. Plus, they're close to the emergency exit door, which makes it easier to evacuate in case of an emergency.

So, which seat is the best? The truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It all depends on your preferences and needs. Do you value easy access or good views? Is your stop at the beginning, middle, or end of the subway line? Each seat has its pros and cons, and it's up to you to decide which one suits you best.

In conclusion, the next time you board the subway, take a moment to consider your seat choice. Don't just go for your go-to spot; take a chance to explore the options and try something new. Who knows, you might even discover a new favorite spot.
