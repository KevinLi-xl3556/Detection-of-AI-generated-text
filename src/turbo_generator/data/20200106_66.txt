California has always been one of the favorite destinations for luxury home buyers. From Malibu to Silicon Valley, California's real estate market is known for its high-end homes and exclusivity. The New York Times recently published an article discussing how $1.4 million homes in California are a new normal. 

The article highlights that homes priced at $1.4 million are no longer considered luxury homes but rather the median price point in certain areas of California. Moreover, the article mentions that the real estate market in California has been on a steady rise in recent years, with the average price of homes increasing year over year.

The article also cited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the real estate market, which has driven high demand for homes with outdoor space and more square footage amidst a growing work-from-home trend. Many people are moving to California to settle down in more spacious and luxurious homes that provide them with the kind of amenities and lifestyle they need.

Real estate experts suggest that the California market's growth will continue in the coming years, with more high-end homes getting listed every year. This means that buyers need to be more discerning than ever when selecting the perfect home based upon their lifestyle preferences and requirements.

Although California's luxury real estate market is known for celebrities, movie stars, tech billionaires, and other wealthy individuals, the average $1.4 million price point is achievable for many people with proper planning and financial stability. However, finding the perfect home requires a comprehensive search accompanied by a well thought out strategy.

In conclusion, California's real estate market is booming, with plenty of options for buyers looking for a luxury home. With a median price of $1.4 million, finding the perfect home in California requires careful planning, research, and a realistic understanding of the market's trajectory. It's apparent that the demand for high-end homes is only continuing to increase, making now an excellent time to invest in a California home.
