On Thursday, the world woke up to a news cycle dominated by the tragic Ukrainian airline crash in Iran, as well as the dramatic escape of former Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn from Japan. Here's a brief on what you need to know:

Ukrainian Airliner Crash in Iran:
On Wednesday, a Ukrainian passenger plane crashed in Iran, killing all 176 passengers and crew members onboard. The plane, which was operated by Ukraine International Airlines, was en route to Kiev from Tehran when it went down. The cause of the crash is still unclear, but Iranian authorities have ruled out a missile attack as the cause. Most of the passengers onboard were Iranian, Ukrainian or Canadian citizens, and dozens were students returning from their holidays.

As with any such disaster, families and friends of the victims are struggling to come to terms with their loss. Politicians around the world, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have expressed condolences and called for a thorough investigation into the crash.

Escape of Carlos Ghosn:
The mystery surrounding Carlos Ghosn's escape from Japan continues to deepen. The former Nissan executive, who was facing charges of financial misconduct, somehow managed to evade 24/7 surveillance in his Tokyo residence and flee to Lebanon, where he holds citizenship. His escape, which reportedly involved hiding in a musical instrument case, has raised questions about Japan's security and legal system.

Ghosn, who was one of the auto industry's most high-profile executives, has denied the charges against him and accused Japan of trying to frame him. His sudden departure has left many wondering whether he will ever face trial or how he could be brought to justice, given that Japan has no extradition agreement with Lebanon.

The world will be watching as the events surrounding the Ukrainian airliner crash and Carlos Ghosn's escape continue to unfold. In times like these, we are reminded of the fragility of life and the unpredictability of events. We can only hope for answers, justice and a better future.
