In a move that is likely to shake the foundation of the United Methodist Church, leaders have recently announced a plan to split the denomination over the contentious issue of same-sex marriage. The split is expected to occur in May 2020 and will result in the formation of a new denomination focused on traditionalist beliefs.

This announcement comes after years of debate within the church over the issue of LGBTQ rights. While some United Methodist churches have welcomed and included members of the LGBTQ community, others have held firm to traditional beliefs that prohibit same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ pastors.

The official plan, known as the Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation, was drafted by a group of 16 church leaders representing different factions within the denomination. The plan allows for traditionalist churches to leave the United Methodist Church and form their own denomination, while also giving them $25 million in funding for the new organization.

However, the plan has not been met with universal approval. Some members of the church believe that splitting the denomination sends the message that the church views LGBTQ individuals as “less than” and unwelcomed in their denomination. Others worry that the church will lose members and influence in a world that is growing more accepting of LGBTQ individuals.

Despite these concerns, leaders who support the split argue that it is necessary to preserve the unity and sanctity of their denomination. In a statement released by the United Methodist Church, Rev. Keith Boyette, president of the Wesleyan Covenant Association and a key architect of the plan, said, “We have come to a moment of great crisis in our denomination. But this is a hopeful moment, because this protocol provides us with a path forward that would maintain and promote a traditional, orthodox understanding of the Christian faith.”

The split is not yet a certainty, as it will require approval by the United Methodist Church’s General Conference in May 2020. If the split is approved, it will be a major departure from the church’s history of bringing diverse groups together and finding common ground. However, it may also provide a path forward for those who have felt excluded from the church’s teachings on gender and sexuality, allowing them to find a religious community where they feel loved and accepted.

Regardless of the outcome, the announcement of the plan to split the United Methodist Church highlights the ongoing debate over LGBTQ rights within many mainstream religious organizations. It may also serve to spark important conversations and shifts in perspective that will shape the future of the church and its relationship to social justice issues for years to come.
