“Just Mercy” is a powerful and emotional film about the fight for justice and the importance of empathy. Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and based on Bryan Stevenson’s book, “Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption,” the film tells the story of Bryan Stevenson, a Harvard-educated lawyer who fights for the rights of prisoners on death row in Alabama.

One of the film’s strengths is how it gets close to its characters. Every character in the film is well developed, and the audience gets to know them intimately. From Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan), the lawyer who believes in justice and is willing to fight for it, to Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), the wrongfully convicted prisoner who has lost all hope, to Eva Ansley (Brie Larson), Stevenson’s assistant who shares his passion for justice, each character is fully realized.

The film’s strong character development is a result of its empathetic approach. The filmmakers do not judge their characters but instead seek to understand them. For example, they show us how the lives of the prisoners are shaped by poverty, racism, and lack of access to education and healthcare. They also show us the fear and anger of the prison guards who work in a system that is broken and corrupt.

The film’s empathetic approach is not only evident in its portrayal of the characters but also in its depiction of the legal system. The filmmakers show us the flaws in the system, the way it fails the innocent and disproportionately affects people of color. But they also show us the humanity of the people who work within the system. For example, Stevenson’s interactions with the district attorney, played by Tim Blake Nelson, are both tense and respectful. The film does not demonize the district attorney but rather shows us the pressures he faces and the biases he may hold.

Another way the film gets close to its characters is through its use of close-ups. The filmmakers use close-ups to capture the emotions of their characters, to show us the pain and suffering they endure. In one scene, the camera stays on Walter McMillian’s face as he describes the fear he felt when he was first arrested. Foxx’s performance is outstanding, and the close-up allows us to see the pain and anguish in his eyes.

In conclusion, “Just Mercy” is a powerful and empathetic film that gets close to its characters. The filmmakers seek to understand their characters rather than judge them, and in doing so, they create a powerful story about the fight for justice. The film’s use of close-ups and its empathetic approach make it an emotional and unforgettable experience.
