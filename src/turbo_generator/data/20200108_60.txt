Elizabeth Wurtzel Finally Grew Up, Like the Rest of Gen X

As the world mourns the loss of Elizabeth Wurtzel, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on her legacy — and the bigger picture of being a child of the ’60s and ’70s. Elizabeth was known for many things, including her best-selling memoir “Prozac Nation,” which chronicled her struggles with depression and addiction. But perhaps more than that, she was an emblematic member of Generation X, the oft-overlooked demographic cohort that has struggled to find its place in a society that worships both youth and age.

Like so many of her peers, Elizabeth was born in the late ’60s — a time of hope and possibility, but also a time of great upheaval. She grew up in an era marked by the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the sexual revolution. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she spent much of her childhood shuttling between homes and fighting against the limitations imposed on her as a young girl.

At 17, Elizabeth was admitted to Harvard, where she studied under the great literary critic Harold Bloom. It was there that she began to develop her voice as a writer, and to explore the themes that would come to define her work — insecurity, alienation, and the search for authenticity in a world that often feels fake.

But after college, Elizabeth struggled to find her footing. She moved to New York, where she worked as a stripper and a temp, and began to spiral into a deep depression. It was during this time that she began to abuse drugs, and to write about the experience in a brutally honest way. “Prozac Nation” — which was published in 1994, when Elizabeth was just 27 years old — was both a commercial and critical success. But it was also controversial, and some critics accused Elizabeth of exploiting her own pain for profit.

In the years that followed, Elizabeth continued to write — not just about her own experiences, but about the larger cultural moment. She criticized the self-help movement, the rise of social media, and the glorification of wealth and celebrity. But even as she railed against these things, she struggled with her own demons — and with the fact that she was no longer the enfant terrible of her youth.

As she wrote in a 2018 essay for The Cut, “Prozac Nation” was “a long time ago,” and she was no longer the same person she had been when she wrote it. “I got sober. I did therapy. I grew up. I became my own cure.” But even as she grew more stable and grounded, she remained an icon to a generation of young women who saw themselves in her struggles, and who looked to her for guidance and inspiration.

Now that Elizabeth is gone, it’s tempting to idealize her — to see her as a tragic figure who burned too bright, and who died too soon. But that would be a mistake. Elizabeth was a complex, flawed person, and her writing was a reflection of that. She was fiercely intelligent, fiercely passionate, and fiercely honest. And like so many of her peers, she struggled to reconcile the dreams of her youth with the realities of adulthood.

But in the end, she did what so many of us do — she grew up. She accepted that life is messy and imperfect, and that there are no easy answers. She embraced the contradictions that make us human, and she used them to create something powerful and lasting. In doing so, she left behind a legacy that will continue to inspire and challenge us long after she’s gone.
