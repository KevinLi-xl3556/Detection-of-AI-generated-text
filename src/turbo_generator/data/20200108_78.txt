With the globalisation of basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is experiencing a shift in power dynamics. Where once the top NBA players hailed from the United States, the sport is now seeing a surge of elite international players. As The New York Times recently highlighted, the NBA's elite are now from everywhere.

International players in the NBA have been on the rise since the 1990s, but in recent years, the number of elite international players entering the league has increased significantly. In the 2020 NBA All-Star game, 19 of the 24 players were born outside the United States. This was a significant shift from just a decade ago, when international players made up only 9% of the league.

This trend can be attributed to a few factors. First, basketball has become a global sport, with more youth in countries like China, Australia, Nigeria, and Spain picking up the game. This is due in part to the NBA's efforts to expand their brand globally by hosting preseason games in other countries and investing in basketball academies overseas.

Second, the NBA has a strong presence outside of the United States. The league has offices in countries around the world, which allows them to scout for talent and build relationships with international players.

Finally, international players are becoming key fixtures on NBA teams. Thanks in part to the success of players like Dirk Nowitzki, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker, teams are now more willing to draft and invest in international players. This has led to a greater level of diversity on NBA rosters, which in turn, has attracted a broader fan base.

While this shift may be surprising to those who grew up with the NBA dominated by American players, it represents an exciting evolution of the sport. As the league continues to expand globally, we can expect to see more elite players from diverse backgrounds making waves in the NBA. This can only serve to make basketball a stronger and more exciting sport to watch.
