The Boeing company was once known to be the shining example of American innovation and engineering prowess. For decades, Boeing manufactured some of the world's most advanced and successful aircraft from the iconic 747 jumbo jet and to the technologically advanced 787 Dreamliner. However, in recent years, the company has come under intense scrutiny and criticism, particularly over its handling of the 737 Max crisis.

At the heart of the crisis is a systemic issue with the company's culture, which allegedly prioritized profit over safety. The New York Times’ newly published article on the matter aptly titled, ‘I Honestly Don’t Trust Many People at Boeing’: A Broken Culture Exposed sheds light on several harrowing details that highlight the culture of dishonesty and mismanagement that has engulfed the company.

The article asserts that widespread problems at the company were already evident in a 2015 survey that showed troubling indicators of some of the issues contributing to today's controversy. The survey revealed that “just one-third of employees felt they could rely on upper management to treat them honestly and with respect" while another showed that 65% of respondents felt pressure to present themselves as the type of employee who did not raise concerns.

It's now widely accepted that corporate culture can have a significant impact on a company's ethical and legal behavior. As the article reveals, Boeing was driven by the pressure to keep up with its competition, particularly European rival Airbus. The company kept its 737 Max cost-effective by providing a computer-based training program for pilots instead of using costly simulation training procedures.

Moreover, the company gave the responsibility of approving the 737 Max to its own employees, which meant that regulatory agencies that typically checked the manufacturer's designs were less involved. As a result, several design faults were overlooked, leading to the two crashes that killed 346 people in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019.

The company's management is accused of brushing off concerns raised by Boeing employees and frequently firing 'whistleblowers' who tried to raise questions about the 737 Max's safety. The culture of the company was designed to prioritize the protection of 'Boeing's image' over listening to and addressing potential risks.

In the end, the company's culture of prioritizing profits over safety and ignoring employee’s concerns may have contributed in no small measure to the tragedies that occurred. The damning revelations are a call to action for corporate leaders to change their priorities from profit-making to helping protect their workers and the general population.

To put Boeing back on track and rebuild its once untarnished image, it must first acknowledge the mistakes made in the past and work to make things right. This should begin with firing executives who sanctioned cost-cutting at the expense of safety and re-evaluating the company's culture in a way that prioritizes safety over anything else.

In conclusion, when the public's safety is at stake, companies must prioritize ensuring the safety of the people they serve. Boeing's failures have exposed a culture of greed and mismanagement that places cost reduction and profit-making above customer safety. The company's management must swear an oath to bring about changes that ensure the safety of their customers, their employees, and the public.
