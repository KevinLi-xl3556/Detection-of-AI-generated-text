Bill Cosby, the disgraced American comedian and actor who was convicted of sexual assault in 2018, has filed a new appeal seeking to overturn his conviction. The appeal, filed in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, alleges that the #MeToo movement and other forms of bias played a significant role in the comedian's conviction.

The new appeal comes after a Pennsylvania appeals court rejected Cosby's previous attempt to overturn his conviction earlier this year. Cosby, who is currently serving a three-to-10-year prison sentence in a Pennsylvania state prison, has always maintained his innocence and has refused to attend any of the sexual assault counseling programs that are required for parole.

Cosby's lawyers argue that the trial judge allowed testimony from five other women who have accused him of sexual assault, despite the absence of any physical evidence or independent witnesses. They say that the testimony from the other accusers was unfairly prejudicial and that it played a significant role in swaying the jury's decision. Cosby's lawyers also argue that the judge should not have allowed the prosecutors to use Cosby's own words against him in the trial.

Cosby, who is now 83 years old, was once a beloved figure in American popular culture. He starred in several successful television shows and movies, most notably "The Cosby Show," which ran for eight seasons in the 1980s. In 2015, numerous women came forward with accusations of sexual assault, which ultimately led to Cosby's conviction in 2018.

The #MeToo movement, which began in Hollywood in 2017, has led to numerous high-profile cases of sexual misconduct being aired in public. The movement has been a particularly potent force in the entertainment industry, where powerful figures have long been accused of using their positions to coerce or assault others.

Cosby's new appeal may be seen as an attempt to capitalize on the current political climate, where issues of sexual harassment and assault are at the forefront of public discourse. However, his case is also likely to raise uncomfortable questions about the potential for bias in the legal system, particularly in cases where the accused is a high-profile figure.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is unlikely to hear arguments in Cosby's new appeal for several months. In the meantime, Cosby is likely to remain in prison, where he will continue to serve his sentence. Despite his attempt to clear his name, it's unclear whether he will ever be able to regain the public's trust or reputation.
