Have you ever felt like the world was spinning around you? That feeling of dizziness, lightheadedness, and disorientation can be a truly overwhelming experience. For those who suffer from chronic vertigo, this sensation can become a daily reality. 

In a recent article by The New York Times, researchers and medical professionals shed light on the struggles of those who live with ongoing vertigo.

Living with chronic vertigo can impact every aspect of one's life, from work to socializing to simply getting out of bed in the morning. It can also be a difficult condition to treat, as there are many possible underlying causes. Some individuals may experience vertigo as a symptom of a larger medical issue, such as a neurological disorder or inner ear problem.
