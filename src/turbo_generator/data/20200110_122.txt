For years, “Mad Men” stood as an iconic and unmatched television series, showing us the glamour and drama of the 1960s advertising world. But after the series ended, many of us were left wondering where to turn for our next fix of sophisticated storytelling and elegant visuals. The answer may be found in an unlikely place: Canada.

“Kim’s Convenience,” a Canadian sitcom created by Ins Choi, has been quietly gaining critical acclaim and wide popularity since its debut in 2016. The show follows the Korean-Canadian Kim family, who run a convenience store in Toronto, and the challenges they face as they navigate family dynamics, cultural differences and the ups and downs of everyday life.

Like “Mad Men,” “Kim’s Convenience” is much more than a straightforward sitcom. It tackles social and political issues with intelligence and nuance, often through the characters’ subtle interactions and the light touch of the writing. But unlike “Mad Men,” “Kim’s Convenience” is also a joyous celebration of family, community and the resilience of the human spirit.

The show’s strength lies in its deep and complex characters, who are brought to life by a talented and diverse cast. There is Mr. and Mrs. Kim, the hardworking and loving parents who struggle to understand their two very different children. Jung, the rebellious son who has a troubled past and a strained relationship with his father. Janet, the ambitious daughter who struggles to balance her career aspirations with her family’s expectations.

But “Kim’s Convenience” is more than just a family drama. It also explores the experiences of the Korean-Canadian community, and the challenges and opportunities they face as they navigate a new culture while trying to preserve their own traditions. The show’s humor is often rooted in cultural misunderstandings and clashes, but it is never cruel or mocking. Rather, it invites us to laugh with the characters as they learn to bridge the gap between their two worlds.

In an age when many of us are feeling uncertain about our place in the world, “Kim’s Convenience” offers a hopeful and uplifting perspective. It reminds us that no matter how different our backgrounds and experiences may be, we are all bound together by our shared humanity. And it does so with a warmth, wit and charm that will leave you wanting more. 

So, if you’ve been looking for a worthy successor to “Mad Men,” look no further than “Kim’s Convenience.” It may not have the same slickness or polished veneer, but it has heart, soul and substance in abundance. And in these uncertain times, that’s worth its weight in gold.
