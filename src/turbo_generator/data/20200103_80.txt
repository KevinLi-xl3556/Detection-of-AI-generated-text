As we head into the weekend, here are a few topics to keep up with in the news: Iran, Democrats, and Carlos Ghosn.

Iran has been a hot topic in the news lately, as tensions continue to rise between the United States and Iran. In recent days, Iran shot down a U.S. drone, which President Trump called a "big mistake." The U.S. has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, which Iran has denied. President Trump has responded to these incidents by imposing new sanctions on Iran, including its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It remains to be seen how this situation will continue to unfold, but it is definitely one to keep an eye on in the coming weeks.

On the political front, the race for the Democratic nomination for president is heating up. The first Democratic primary debates were held this week, with 20 candidates taking the stage over two nights. Among the highlights were Elizabeth Warren's strong performance, Julian Castro's breakout moment, and Joe Biden's somewhat lackluster showing. With so many candidates and so much at stake, the next few months should prove to be a fascinating and unpredictable period in American politics.

Finally, former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn is back in the news. Ghosn was arrested last year in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, including underreporting his income and using company funds for personal expenses. After months in jail, he was released on bail and placed under house arrest in Tokyo. However, this week Ghosn fled to Lebanon, apparently with the help of accomplices who smuggled him out of Japan. Ghosn's escape has caused a stir and raised questions about how he was able to evade Japanese authorities. It also marks the latest twist in a high-profile case that has captivated the business world.

As always, these stories and others will continue to develop in the coming days and weeks. Stay tuned and stay informed.
