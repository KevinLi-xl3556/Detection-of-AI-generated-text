As the popularity of electric bikes continues to rise across the United States, so too does the incidence of theft. In cities like New York, where e-bikes are particularly popular among delivery workers, cyclists have reported an increase in thefts in recent months. In some cases, e-bike riders have even been attacked and robbed.

The thefts and attacks are reminiscent of a similar trend that occurred in the early 2000s, when delivery workers in urban centers were frequently targeted for the cash they carried while making deliveries. Now, instead of cash, e-bikes have become the new target.

E-bikes, or electric bicycles, have exploded in popularity over the last few years as a more environmentally friendly and efficient mode of transportation. They’re particularly popular among gig economy workers like food delivery drivers, who rely on the bikes to quickly navigate through crowded urban areas.

However, the bikes are also more expensive than traditional bicycles, with some models easily running over $2,000. This, coupled with their popularity and ease of theft, has made them a prime target for thieves.

One e-bike rider in Brooklyn, who preferred not to be named, told The New York Times that he had his bike stolen three times in three months. “It’s really frustrating. I rely on this bike for work, and every time it gets stolen, I lose money and time,” he said.

In addition to thefts, e-bike riders have also reported attacks. Earlier this year, a delivery worker in the Bronx was attacked and robbed of his e-bike and the food he was delivering. In another instance, a group of attackers on bikes robbed a delivery worker of his phone, money, and e-bike.

Some law enforcement officials and advocacy groups believe that the increase in e-bike thefts and attacks can be attributed to a lack of regulations around the bikes. While e-bikes are legal in New York City, the city’s laws around their use are often unclear, and riders are frequently ticketed for violations.

Advocacy groups like the Electric Bike Action Coalition are pushing for clearer regulations and better enforcement to protect e-bike riders from thefts and attacks. It’s a small but growing movement that could help to protect the rights and safety of those relying on e-bikes for work.

As e-bikes continue to grow in popularity, it’s clear that something must be done to address the increase in thefts and attacks. Until then, e-bike riders will have to remain vigilant, taking whatever steps they can to protect themselves and their bikes from potential threats.
