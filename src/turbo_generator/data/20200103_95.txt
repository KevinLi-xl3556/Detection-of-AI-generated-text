As the 2020 Presidential Election draws closer, many are already speculating about the possibility of Joe Biden running for a second term, should he win the presidency. However, in my opinion, the best-case scenario would be for Biden to make a clear commitment to serving only one term.

Joe Biden is no stranger to the presidency, he served as Barack Obama’s Vice President for two terms. His extensive career in government has earned him the respect of many, but at age 78, he is one of the oldest presidential candidates in history. Age shouldn't be the only determining factor for whether he should run again, but it is certainly a point of concern, as implicit memory impairments can set in, leading to inappropriate comments and actions.

Moreover, serving as President is an immense responsibility and takes a significant physical and mental toll on anyone who takes on the job. Joe Biden has already publicly acknowledged this, saying that “If anything changes in my health, making it incapable for me to fully exert all the energy and mental acuity needed to carry out this job, I won’t hesitate to step aside and let someone else take the reins.”

One of the great things about committing to one term is that it allows a President to put the country before their own political aspirations. Instead of focusing on re-election and posturing for the next term, a one-term President can concentrate on carrying out their platform without being distracted by the politics of re-election. This can lead to more productive and effective policies that work for everyone, instead of just those who voted for the President.

In his campaign, Biden has made it clear that he intends to unite the country, create a fairer and more equitable society, and bring hope to millions of Americans who have felt overlooked in recent years. With only four years in office, he could focus all of his efforts on achieving these goals and delivering the change his supporters are asking for.

Furthermore, committing to a one-term presidency would create an opportunity for the Vice President, who would take on a more significant leadership role in the next election. This would give the party an opportunity to highlight another strong candidate and ensure continuity in the platform and policies that Biden has put forth. Additionally, this would create more chance for diversity within the party, as there would be time for other candidates to emerge and build a following before 2024.

In conclusion, Joe Biden running for just one term would be good for the country and good for the Democratic Party. He has the ability to make a lasting impact in just four years, and by doing so, leave the party in a strong position for the future. Of course, it is up to Biden to decide whether to commit for one or two terms, but I hope that he will keep in mind the benefits of focusing on the country rather than politics.
