On June 26, 2020, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to delay the hearing of a lawsuit against Obamacare until after the presidential election in November. The lawsuit, led by Republican attorneys general, seeks to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.

The Trump administration's request comes as the country grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of access to affordable healthcare. The lawsuit, if successful, could leave millions of Americans without health insurance coverage, including individuals with pre-existing conditions.

The administration has long opposed Obamacare, which was enacted in 2010 under President Barack Obama. President Trump has repeatedly attempted to repeal the law and replace it with a new healthcare plan, but has not been successful in doing so.

The lawsuit against Obamacare centers around the law's individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance or face a penalty. In 2017, a Republican-led Congress eliminated the penalty, leading to the current legal challenge.

The Trump administration argues that the Supreme Court should not hear the case until after the election because the issue of healthcare is a major campaign issue. They also cite the challenges of responding to the Covid-19 pandemic while dealing with the lawsuit.

Democrats criticize the administration's stance, arguing that delaying the lawsuit would only create more uncertainty for Americans who rely on Obamacare for their healthcare coverage. Furthermore, they argue that the timing of the request suggests that the administration is more focused on the presidential election than on the health and wellbeing of Americans.

The fate of Obamacare remains uncertain, but it is clear that the issue of healthcare will continue to be a major topic of discussion during the 2020 election. As the pandemic continues to impact millions of Americans, access to affordable healthcare has become more important than ever. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in the Obamacare lawsuit in the fall, but it remains to be seen how the case will ultimately be settled.
