Fazle Abed, the founder of the leading relief agency, BRAC, has passed away at the age of 83. Abed dedicated his life to poverty alleviation and established BRAC in 1972, beginning with a modest relief operation to help refugees who fled from the war-torn Bangladesh.

BRAC, which stands for Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, has since grown to become the world's largest non-governmental development organization, operating in over 10 countries around the globe. Abed's death is a significant loss to the humanitarian world, which has seen a sharp rise in the number of crises over the years.

Abed's dedication to poverty alleviation and commitment to the cause saw him become a significant figure in the global development community. He received numerous national and international awards throughout his lifetime, including the prestigious Spanish Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation and the World Food Prize.

BRAC's success is built on the principle of empowering individuals and communities to bring change from within. Through its programs, BRAC has provided millions of people with access to healthcare, education, and financial services. For example, its microfinance program has enabled thousands of women to start their businesses, lifting them out of poverty and creating economic opportunities in their communities.

As news of Abed's death spreads, condolences have started pouring in from across the world. His life and legacy have touched the hearts of millions, and he leaves behind a lasting impact on the development world.

His legacy will remain an inspiration to all those who continue this vital work, and for generations to come. His passion for helping others and building sustainable communities will continue to inspire those who wish to bring about lasting change around the world.
