In India, pickles are often considered more than just a condiment. They are a part of the country’s culture and heritage, and play a crucial role in preserving regional cuisines. And who better to represent this than India’s very own ‘Pickle Queen’, Shubha Jain.

Shubha, a resident of the city of Indore in Madhya Pradesh, has been making pickles for over 15 years now. What started as a hobby, quickly turned into a passion and eventually a full-time profession. Shubha’s unique blend of spices and her attention to detail have made her pickles a favorite among many in India and abroad.

But it’s not just about the taste for Shubha. She believes that pickling is a way to preserve the past, and her pickles are a testament to this belief. “Pickles are not just a food item, they are a memory”, she says. “Every time I make a pickle, I am preserving a piece of history”.

Shubha’s pickles are not just limited to mangoes, lemons, and chilies. She has experimented with a variety of ingredients and has pickled everything from raw jackfruit and carrots to garlic and even meat. Her pickles are often infused with ingredients that are specific to a particular region or culture, making them a true representation of India’s diverse food culture.

In addition to her commercial venture, Shubha also runs workshops to teach people the art of pickling. She believes that teaching others is the key to preserving the tradition of pickling, and ensuring that it is passed down to future generations.

Shubha’s pickles may just be a condiment to some, but to her and many others, they represent much more. They are a piece of history, a way to preserve regional cuisines, and a symbol of India’s diverse culture. And for that reason, she truly deserves the title of India’s ‘Pickle Queen’.
