On January 5th, 2020, the Golden Globes ceremony was hosted by none other than the controversial comedian Ricky Gervais. Gervais, an infamous funnyman, known for his irreverence, snarky jokes, and biting sarcasm, returned for his fifth time hosting the prestigious ceremony. And as usual, his monologue was a combination of laughs, gasps, and cringes.

Opening with a scathing attack on the Hollywood elite, Gervais, clad in a black suit and tie, addressed the audience with his signature deadpan sarcasm, “Hello and welcome to the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards, live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, in Los Angeles. I'm Ricky Gervais, thank you. You'll be pleased to know, this is the last time I’m hosting these awards. So, I don’t care anymore."

Gervais quickly established the tone for the evening with jokes aimed at the film and television industry's elite. He joked that the award statues were just meaningless trophies that people gave to themselves, and he scolded the audience for their hypocrisy, calling them out on their involvement in various scandals, and chastising them for their holier-than-thou attitudes.

His no-holds-barred style created awkward moments throughout the ceremony, leaving viewers torn between laughter and offense. Gervais ruffled a few feathers when he introduced the cast of the Netflix series "The Crown" by taking a shot at Prince Andrew's ties to alleged sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

He also took aim at celebrities who use their platform to espouse political views, "If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So, if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God and f##k off," he said.

Gervais's dark humor may have been offensive to some, but his fans loved every moment of it. Viewers who were familiar with his previous controversies wouldn't have been too surprised by his abrasiveness. However, there were moments that were genuinely hilarious in his monologue, such as his joke about many of the nominated actors “are pretending to be nice people, but most of you are not.”

In conclusion, Ricky Gervais's hosting of the Golden Globes was a memorable experience, indicative of the rude, crude, and socially unacceptable humor that he’s come to be known for. His jokes combined with his devil-may-care attitude, stunned and delighted viewers. Regardless, his performance undoubtedly left an impression on the audience, an impression that will not be soon forgotten.
