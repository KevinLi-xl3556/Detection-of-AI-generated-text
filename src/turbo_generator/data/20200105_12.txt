The city of Berkeley, California, is taking a bold step in the fight against climate change. The City Council is currently considering a proposal that would ban natural gas hookups in new buildings starting next year, and expand the ban to all buildings by 2045.

Natural gas is used to heat homes and buildings, but it also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of natural gas releases carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming.

Berkeley's proposed ban is a significant move towards reducing carbon emissions and meeting the city's climate goals. Mayor Jesse Arregu√≠n said in a statement, "We cannot wait any longer to take bold action on the climate crisis. Berkeley has always been a leader in sustainability and this ordinance continues that legacy."

The proposal has received mixed reactions. Some, like environmental groups and clean energy advocates, praise the city for taking action to address climate change. Others, including the natural gas industry and some homeowners, are concerned about the costs of switching to electric heating and worry that the ban could limit consumer choice.

However, Berkeley is not alone in taking action on natural gas. Several other cities in California, including San Francisco and San Jose, have implemented similar bans on natural gas in new buildings. In Massachusetts, the city of Brookline recently passed a bylaw prohibiting the installation of new fossil-fuel infrastructure in any type of building.

With increasing awareness of the dangers of climate change and the urgent need to reduce emissions, it seems likely that more cities will follow Berkeley's lead in banning natural gas in buildings. By taking action at the local level, cities can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change and create a cleaner, more sustainable future for everyone.
