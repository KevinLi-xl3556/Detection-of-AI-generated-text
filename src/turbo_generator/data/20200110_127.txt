On Monday, the Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti endorsed Joe Biden for president. This is a significant endorsement for Biden, as Garcetti is a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, with a national profile and personal ambitions.

In his endorsement statement, Garcetti said, "We need a leader who understands what's at stake, who will fight for working families, and who can defeat Donald Trump in November. That leader, without a doubt, is Joe Biden."

Garcetti's endorsement was not unexpected. He served as the national co-chair of Biden's 2020 campaign, and has been a vocal supporter of the former Vice President for months. Garcetti himself had considered running for president earlier this year, but ultimately dropped out of the race.

This endorsement comes at a critical time for Biden's campaign, as he seeks to consolidate support among Democratic Party leaders and voters ahead of the closely contested primary season. With the Iowa caucuses less than two weeks away, endorsements from prominent politicians can help sway voters and signal to the party establishment who they should support.

The endorsement also highlights the importance of California's primary, which takes place on March 3rd. California is the most populous state in the country and has a large number of delegates, making it a critical battleground in the Democratic race. Garcetti's endorsement gives Biden an added boost in a state where his main rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, has been polling strongly.

Biden's campaign responded to Garcetti's endorsement with a statement thanking the mayor for his support. "Eric has been a tireless advocate for Los Angeles and a trusted ally to our campaign," the statement read. "We're honored to have his support as we work to restore the soul of the nation and build a better future for all Americans."

Overall, Garcetti's endorsement is a significant boost for Joe Biden's campaign. With support from a prominent Democratic Party leader and potential vice presidential candidate, Biden can continue to build momentum and consolidate his support ahead of the primary season. As the race heats up, it will be interesting to see which other influential politicians follow Garcetti's lead and endorse a candidate for president.
