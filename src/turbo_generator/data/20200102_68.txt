As a lawyer, Few people would guess that a person could be a passionate advocate for human rights and social justice while also being a successful criminal defense attorney. However, in her new documentary "Advocate," director Rachel Leah Jones defies this stereotype.

The film focuses on Lea Tsemel, an Israeli lawyer who has spent her entire career fighting for Palestinians charged with crimes against the Israeli state. Despite being both revered and reviled in her homeland, Tsemel is an unwavering presence, fiercely advocating for the rights of her clients, even when it means going up against the powers that be.

One of the most striking elements of "Advocate" is Tsemel’s own personal story. Born and raised in Jerusalem, Tsemel rejected the traditional path of marriage and motherhood and instead dedicated her life to fighting for social change. Throughout the documentary, we see her personal struggles, including the pressures of being a public figure, the toll it takes on her family life, and the constant death threats.

Jones’s documentary is not just about Tsemel’s story; it also offers an insightful look into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the perspective of the Palestinian defendants Tsemel represents. Through intimate interviews with her clients and their loved ones, "Advocate" shows us the devastating human toll of the ongoing conflict

However, it’s Tsemel herself who steals the show in "Advocate." She is a fiercely intelligent and unapologetic advocate for justice, dedicating her life to those who are oftentimes forgotten and neglected by society. As one of her colleagues puts it, "She defends more than just her clients: she defends the principle of human rights."

"Advocate" is not just a compelling and thought-provoking documentary; it’s also a call to action. The film’s narrative is a powerful reminder of the importance of human rights and social justice, especially in times of political turmoil and division.

"Advocate" is a film that should be seen by anyone who values human rights and social justice. It’s a compelling story of a woman who stood up for what she believed in, even when it was difficult and unpopular. It’s an ode to the power of the individual to make a difference in the world, even in the face of overwhelming adversity. And, most importantly, it’s a call to action for all of us to do the same.
