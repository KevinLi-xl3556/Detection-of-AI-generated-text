In a world where women's voices are often drowned out or belittled, there is a seething anger bubbling up from within. This rage is not unfounded, but rather a response to years of oppression, discrimination, and marginalization. To help channel this energy and give it a voice, we have compiled a list of 16 books that explore the complexities of female rage.
