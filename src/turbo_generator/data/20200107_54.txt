On Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he will move forward with the impeachment trial of President Trump without making a deal regarding witnesses. This decision has drawn criticism from Democrats who want to hear from witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial.

McConnell released a statement on Sunday evening outlining his stance on the witness issue. "I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement that sets forth a structure for the impeachment trial of the President that is fair to all sides," McConnell said. "We will vote on whether to call witnesses at the appropriate time during the trial."

McConnell's announcement comes after weeks of negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats over the issue of witnesses. Democrats have been pushing for witnesses to be called during the trial, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who has indicated he would be willing to testify.

While McConnell has not ruled out the possibility of calling witnesses at a later time, Democrats are concerned that witnesses will be called only after the trial has concluded, rendering their testimony essentially useless. Some Democrats have also accused McConnell of trying to rush the trial through and prevent a fair and thorough investigation.

The decision by McConnell to move forward without a witness deal could have significant implications for the impeachment trial. Without witnesses, Democrats will have a more difficult time making their case against Trump. However, McConnell has argued that witnesses are not necessary and that the evidence presented by the House of Representatives is sufficient to make a decision on impeaching the President.

As the impeachment trial moves forward, it is unclear how the lack of witness testimony will impact the final outcome. Democrats will likely continue to push for witnesses to be called, while Republicans will argue that the House of Representatives should have presented a stronger case if they wanted to impeach the President.

Despite the contentious nature of the impeachment trial, both sides have expressed a desire to move quickly through the proceedings. With the Iowa caucuses just weeks away and the 2020 Presidential election looming, there are concerns that the trial will affect the Democratic primary race and disrupt the electoral process.

In the end, it remains to be seen whether the lack of witnesses in the impeachment trial will impact the final outcome. However, the decision by McConnell to move forward without making a deal on the issue indicates that he is confident in the strength of his case against the President. Whether that confidence is justified, only time will tell.
