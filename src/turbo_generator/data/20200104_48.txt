"What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Midsommar’ and ‘Dracula'"

Saturday nights are usually filled with exciting TV options, and this week is no exception. If you're a fan of horror and suspense, you don't want to miss out on two fantastic titles that will premiere on Jan. 16.

"Midsommar" is a 2019 film directed by Ari Aster, following the life of Dani, played by Florence Pugh, after a tragic accident. The film takes her to a summer festival in a remote Swedish village with her boyfriend, played by Jack Reynor, and other travelers. The festival is far from idyllic, however, and the group finds itself caught up in the traditions and rituals of a pagan cult that celebrates the summer solstice.

"Midsommar" is a stunningly visualized and well-crafted horror film that manages to be both gorgeous and terrifying. Florence Pugh's performance has been praised and recognized for its complexity and emotional depth. The film is a must-watch for fans of the genre.

"Dracula" is a new three-part series from the creators of "Sherlock." Starring Danish actor Claes Bang as the iconic vampire count, the program is a retelling of the classic Bram Stoker tale with a modern twist. The story is told over three episodes, each following a different period in Dracula's long life.

The series has already aired in the UK to rave reviews, and it looks to be one of the most successful and ambitious adaptations of the novel in years. Claes Bang's performance has been compared to some of the classic portrayals of Dracula on screen, and the series itself has been praised for the way it manages to reinvent the story while remaining true to the original.

Both "Midsommar" and "Dracula" offer fantastic options for an evening of entertainment. Whether you're in the mood for a terrifying and emotional experience or a fresh take on a classic tale, you won't be disappointed in these offerings. Tune in on Jan. 16 and see for yourself!
