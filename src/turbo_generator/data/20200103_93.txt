As college basketball continues to evolve, the hiring of younger, up-and-coming coaches has become increasingly common. While these coaches may bring fresh perspectives and new strategies, there is still value in the wisdom and experience of the older coaches who have been through it all. This is where the sages of college basketball come in.

These veteran coaches, who have been around for decades, are often brought in to assist these newer coaches with their transition into the world of high-stakes basketball. They offer guidance and support, and provide a different kind of mentorship that cannot be replaced.

One example of this is former Georgetown coach John Thompson Jr., who recently became an advisor to current Georgetown coach Patrick Ewing. Thompson brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, having coached Georgetown for 27 years and leading the team to the NCAA championship in 1984. His guidance has undoubtedly been invaluable to Ewing, who is in his second year as head coach.

Another example is Tom Izzo, the longtime coach of Michigan State. Izzo has been with the Spartans for over 20 years and has led them to eight Final Fours and a national championship. He has also been instrumental in mentoring his assistant coaches, such as current Northern Illinois coach Mark Montgomery, who spent 12 years as an assistant under Izzo. Montgomery credits Izzo for teaching him the importance of hard work and discipline, and for preparing him for his current position.

Older coaches also have a unique perspective on the game, having seen it evolve over the years. They can offer insights and strategies that younger coaches may not have considered, and can help them adapt to changes in the sport. This is especially important in college basketball, where recruiting and player development are crucial to success.

Some may argue that the hiring of older coaches is a sign that younger coaches are not capable of handling the job on their own. However, this is simply not true. Bringing in a sage of college basketball is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength. It shows that the newer coach is willing to humble themselves and seek out the advice of those who have come before them. It also shows a commitment to excellence, as these veteran coaches have a proven track record of success.

In conclusion, the sages of college basketball play an important role in the development of younger coaches and the success of their programs. They offer a unique perspective, valuable experience, and unwavering support. As college basketball continues to evolve and younger coaches emerge, it is important not to forget the wisdom and mentorship that these legends of the sport can provide.
