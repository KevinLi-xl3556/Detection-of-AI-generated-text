On August 24, 2018, the New York Times released an article that shook the environmental community. The article, titled "Trump Rule Would Exclude Climate Change in Infrastructure Planning," outlined the Trump administration's newest proposal to re-define the guidelines for infrastructure planning in the United States. The implications of this decision are severe, and the potential consequences will impact both the short and long-term future of America.

The proposed changes suggest that when evaluating would-be construction projects, agencies should no longer consider the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather patterns and droughts. The administration claims that these considerations are unnecessary because they fall outside the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act, the primary guidebook for federal agencies in the planning and permitting process. Instead, federal agencies would focus on more narrow criteria, such as safety conditions, project costs, and the impact on local communities.

This move by the Trump administration is a massive mistake and a short-sighted policy decision. Climate change is one of the most significant environmental challenges facing the world today, and it's already affecting every aspect of American infrastructure. Roads, bridges, electrical grids, and other critical pieces of infrastructure are all exposed to the impacts of climate change, and ignoring this in planning will only exacerbate the problem. Failure to account for the damage that infrastructure can inflict upon climate change raises the chances of catastrophic natural disasters, leading to untold destruction, displacement and economic costs.

The proposed policy cannot be overlooked just because of the possible immediate benefits to the country's infrastructure. This rule change will only worsen the impending damage of climate change, which has catastrophic costs, including rising sea levels, loss of life, and immeasurable economic damage. Speeding up infrastructure projects at the expense of the environment and the planet altogether should always be a matter of concern.

The United States government should not purposefully turn a blind eye to climate change. The country must prepare for it as the crisis it is. The decision-making process must factor in the long-term impacts of human activity, including those which exacerbate climate change. This decision undermines the ability of government officials to make informed choices from the available information.

In conclusion, the Trump administration's proposed rule change would exclude climate change from infrastructure planning. This decision is a mistake that could have irreversible consequences for the environment and millions of people in America. The continued exposure of critical infrastructure and long-term economic plans to rising sea levels, storms, and variations in temperature will not disappear with a single executive order. Instead, the guidelines for infrastructure planning should account for the long-term impact of human activity on climate change. The short-sightedness exhibited must be stopped, and all stakeholders in consideration should support and take into account the adverse consequences of climate change for infrastructure planning.
