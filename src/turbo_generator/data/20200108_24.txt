In the aftermath of Iran's retaliation against the United States for the killing of their top general Soleimani, many were bracing themselves for a full-blown war between the two nations. However, Iran's calculated response seems to have halted further escalation of the conflict, and surprisingly given President Trump a way to declare victory.

Despite being rhetorically tough on Iran, Trump has long voiced his opposition against the prolonged involvement of the United States in Middle Eastern wars. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that after authorizing a drone attack that killed Soleimani in early January, Trump seemed eager to step back slightly, hoping that Iran would not respond with further aggression.

As Iran's initial missile strikes primarily targeted Iraqi bases containing U.S. troops, no direct loss of life occurred, thus giving Trump an opportunity to relax his stance and avoid further escalation, albeit with a retaliatory airstrike and tough sanctions.

Iran's predictable, targeted and proportionate response allowed both sides to avoid further bloodshed and come out with some gain in this high-stakes gamble. Iran showcased its military prowess and gave a signal to the United States that it will not be cowed into submission easily. On the other hand, Trump can claim he has successfully averted a major war and bring back troops, bolstering his domestic appeal with upcoming elections.

However, the situation remains somewhat fragile. The Trump Administration’s campaign of “maximum pressure” and stringent sanctions continue to cripple Iran's economy, further exacerbating domestic turmoil in the country. Therefore, in the upcoming months, we need to keep a close eye on this political stand-off, as even a small miscalculation can trigger a full-scale war.

In conclusion, Trump's strategy has been to use the threat of military action to achieve his desired goals. This time, Iran chose not to take an unpredictable approach and respond with bloodshed, but rather respond proportionately. Whether Iran will choose a similar approach in the future or will resort to such actions remains to be seen. However, if the United States continues down the path of "maximum pressure," it is more likely that Iran will eventually take unpredictable actions, possibly leading to severe consequences for both nations, and the global community.
