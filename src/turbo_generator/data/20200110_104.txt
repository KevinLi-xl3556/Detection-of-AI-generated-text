In a somewhat unexpected twist, an ex-Democrat received an endorsement from none other than former President Donald Trump, shaking up a GOP primary race. A frontrunner, who seemed to be cruising towards victory, suddenly found themselves facing a formidable opponent with the power of Trump's endorsement.

Trump's endorsement of Susan Wright, the widow of the late Republican Representative Ron Wright in a special election for Texas's sixth Congressional district seemed like a done deal. That was until he endorsed Jake Ellzey, a former Democrat who had once donated to Barack Obama's campaign, only a few days before the election.

This move left many wondering what Trump had seen in Ellzey, a Navy veteran who was flying under the radar. It also highlighted the former president's willingness to turn on his own party, especially when it comes to backing candidates that he deems more aligned with his brand of conservatism.

The endorsement of Ellzey was seen as a snub to Wright, who was considered to be the favored candidate in the race. The decision came as a shock to many, and it was met with immediate criticism from some Republicans, who viewed it as yet another example of Trump's unpredictable behavior.

Some saw Trump's snub of Wright as a turning point in the GOP, with the party establishment starting to distance itself from the former president. Others, however, saw it as further proof that Trump remains the driving force behind the Republican party, and that his influence is unlikely to wane anytime soon.

Despite the setback, Wright remains a strong contender. She is a longtime conservative activist and advocate for her late husband's legacy as a staunch Trump supporter in Congress. The support she has received from Republican establishment figures such as Senator Ted Cruz shows that she still has a lot of backing within the party.

Meanwhile, Ellzey has positioned himself as a more moderate alternative, drawing support from some Republicans who view him as a more electable choice in the general election. He has also tried to appeal to the more Trump-skeptic wing of the party by emphasizing his Navy service and support for gun rights.

At the end of the day, Trump's endorsement may have shaken things up in the Texas primary, but it remains to be seen what impact it will have on the national stage. Some see it as a sign of things to come, with Trump continuing to intervene in GOP primaries and potentially shaping the party's direction. Others see it as a one-time fluke, with the former president simply playing politics and choosing the candidate he thinks is most likely to win.

Regardless of the outcome of the Texas primary, it is clear that the GOP remains divided, with a struggle for the soul of the party still ongoing. Whether Trump's endorsement of Ellzey is a sign of unity or division remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the race in Texas's sixth Congressional district has become a lot more interesting.
