As a writer, I was tasked with writing an article on the New York Times' Tuesday evening briefing, which featured three distinct topics: Iran, impeachment, and Elizabeth Wurtzel. Each topic showcases a different facet of the news cycle and offers insight into the most pressing issues of the day.

Firstly, Iran's ongoing conflict with the United States continues to dominate the news cycle. After the US military airstrike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani earlier this year, tensions between the two nations have been heightened. Most recently, Iran has announced that it will increase its uranium enrichment, a move that could bring the nation closer to producing weapons-grade uranium. As the world watches and waits to see how this situation will unfold, it is clear that Iran will remain a major focus in the coming days and weeks.

Next, the impeachment of President Donald Trump is an issue that has captivated the nation for months. As the trial progresses in the Senate, both sides of the political aisle remain staunch in their beliefs. For those in support of the president, the impeachment is seen as a partisan attempt to oust him from office. For those in opposition, the impeachment is an effort to uphold the rule of law and protect American democracy. Regardless of one's opinions on the matter, the outcome of the trial will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the upcoming presidential election.

Lastly, the passing of author and journalist Elizabeth Wurtzel has left a void in the literary world. Best known for her memoir "Prozac Nation," Wurtzel was an influential voice on mental health and addiction. Her writing laid bare the realities of struggling with these issues, and her legacy will continue to inspire those who face similar challenges.

In conclusion, Tuesday evening's briefing from the New York Times featured three topics that highlight the breadth and depth of the news cycle. From international conflicts to domestic politics to the loss of a revered artist, each topic offers a lens through which to view the complexities of our world.
