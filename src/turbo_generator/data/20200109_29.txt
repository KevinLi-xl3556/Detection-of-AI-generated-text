Grubhub, one of the major players in the food ordering and delivery market, has announced changes to its ordering system in response to mounting pressure from customers and competition from other platforms. 

Grubhub has long been a popular choice for consumers looking to order food from their favorite local restaurants, with its easy-to-use app and wide selection of dining options. However, the company has recently come under fire for some controversial business practices, including charging restaurants for phone orders that don't result in an actual sale, and creating shell websites for restaurants that don't have their own online presence, essentially taking control of their branding and online marketing.

In the face of these criticisms and increased competition from rivals like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Postmates, Grubhub has had to rethink its approach. In a recent blog post, the company announced a new policy aimed at improving transparency and fairness for restaurants.

Starting in June, Grubhub will no longer charge restaurants for phone calls that don't result in an actual order. The company will also stop creating fake websites for restaurants, and will instead work with them to create their own online presence.

These changes are a step in the right direction for Grubhub, which has faced a public backlash in recent months. However, the company still has much work to do in order to earn back the trust of both its restaurant partners and its customers.

One of the key issues at play here is the high fees that Grubhub, and other food delivery platforms, charge restaurants for each order. While these fees can be convenient for customers, they can be a major burden for independent restaurants, which are already struggling to compete in an increasingly crowded market.

Grubhub's new policy is a good start, but it may not be enough to address this larger issue. The company will need to continue to listen to the concerns of both restaurants and consumers, and work to find a more sustainable business model that benefits everyone involved.

Overall, the changes announced by Grubhub represent a positive step forward for the company, and for the food delivery market as a whole. By addressing some of its past missteps and committing to greater transparency and fairness, Grubhub is setting a new standard for the industry. Whether or not the company can follow through on these promises remains to be seen, but it's clear that the pressure is on for Grubhub and its competitors to do better.
