Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, has announced that his presidential campaign raised $24.7 million in the final quarter of 2019. This news comes as a significant boost for the Democratic candidate, as he aims to establish himself as a leading hopeful in the crowded race for the White House.

According to reports, the fundraising sum makes up a significant portion of the $76.2 million that Buttigieg has raised since launching his campaign in April 2019. His campaign officials have also stated that this announcement is an indication that they are on track to meet their fundraising goals for the ongoing primary season.

In a statement, Buttigieg praised his campaign staffers and supporters for their hard work in contributing to the fundraising. He also highlighted the diversity of the donors, noting that his team had received contributions from a broad range of people from different backgrounds and demographics.

“With this quarter’s fundraising haul, we are well-positioned to continue to compete in the early states and have the resources to invest in Super Tuesday and beyond,” Buttigieg added.

The fundraising announcement comes at a critical time for Buttigieg, as he looks to establish himself as a leading candidate in the upcoming Iowa caucuses. In a recent poll conducted by Des Moines Register and CNN, Buttigieg was ranked as one of the top candidates in Iowa, behind only Senator Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg’s success seems to have been driven by his focus on more moderate Democratic voters, who are looking for an alternative to Senator Sanders, who has emerged as a front-runner in the race. His strong performance in the Iowa polls has also raised his profile with the broader electorate, which may help him make inroads in other primary states.

While the fundraising news is undoubtedly a boost for Buttigieg's presidential campaign, it also highlights the importance of financial resources in modern political campaigns. With the Democratic field still to be narrowed down, the ability to raise funds will be a key factor in deciding which candidate can maintain a competitive campaign and build momentum.

As the Democratic race heats up heading into the New Year, Buttigieg’s strong fundraising quarter is sure to be watched closely by his rivals and political observers alike. With the Iowa caucuses right around the corner, it remains to be seen whether this financial boost will translate into electoral success for the South Bend mayor.
