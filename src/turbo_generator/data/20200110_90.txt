There's nothing quite like a perfectly roasted chicken - crispy skin, juicy meat, and flavors that just cannot be replicated in any other way. But what if we told you that there was a way to make that perfectly crispy skin even crispier, without sacrificing any of the flavor and moisture in the meat? 

That's right, folks - it's time to up your roast chicken game with this simple technique we've discovered for maximizing the crispy bits. 

First things first: start with a high-quality bird. A pasture-raised chicken, preferably organic, will have richer flavor and better texture than a factory-farmed bird. 

Next, dry the chicken thoroughly inside and out with paper towels. This step is crucial - excess moisture will prevent the skin from getting as crispy as possible. 

Now it's time for the secret weapon: baking powder. That's right, a little sprinkle of baking powder all over the chicken will create a perfectly crispy, golden brown skin that you won't be able to resist picking at. 

Just mix together 3 tablespoons of baking powder with 1 tablespoon of salt, and sprinkle it all over the chicken, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies. Roast the chicken as you normally would, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the crispy skin that results. 

But the magic doesn't stop there. The extra-crispy skin means that there will be more rendered fat in the pan, which can be used to baste the chicken as it cooks. This will only intensify the flavors and make the meat even more juicy. 

So the next time you're in the mood for a roast chicken dinner, give this technique a try. You'll be blown away by the results and may just find yourself picking at those crispy bits long after the meal is over.
