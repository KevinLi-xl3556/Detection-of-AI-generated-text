The tactile experience of the pages with cutouts and textures make it an interactive and exciting read for young children.

For toddlers who love animals, "Dear Zoo" by Rod Campbell is a must-read. This lift-the-flap book allows children to guess and discover which animal is hidden behind each flap. The repetition of the text and the fun surprise of each animal keeps children engaged and excited throughout the book.
