How 7-Eleven Struck Back Against an Owner Who Took a Day Off

For most people, taking a day off from work is a normal and lawful practice that allows them to recharge, attend to personal matters, or pursue leisure activities. However, for some franchise owners, taking a day off can be a risky move that exposes them to retaliation from their franchisors, who see any absence as a breach of their contractual obligations. This was the case for Javed Fiyaz, a 7-Eleven owner in Long Island, whose brief hiatus in 2019 led to a series of bizarre and punitive measures by his corporate overseers.

In a recent article published by The New York Times, reporters Rachel Abrams and Matthew Goldstein detail the ordeal that Fiyaz faced after he closed his store for a day in October 2019, without seeking permission from 7-Eleven, whose franchise agreement states that owners cannot "abandon the operation" or "disappear from the business." Although Fiyaz said he had to take his wife to a doctor's appointment and trusted his employees to manage the store, 7-Eleven accused him of violating their agreement and began an aggressive campaign of inspections, fines, and threats against him.

According to the article, within weeks of Fiyaz's absence, 7-Eleven called in a team of auditors and enforcement officers to review his records, inventory, and security footage, looking for any evidence of misconduct or noncompliance. They allegedly found several minor infractions, such as expired food items, missing receipts, and unlocked doors, and issued Fiyaz multiple notices of default and demands for payment, totaling more than $168,000. When Fiyaz protested or asked for clarification, 7-Eleven allegedly ignored or belittled him, saying that he was lucky not to be terminated, and that his "behavior borderlined on arrogance."

The article also describes how 7-Eleven used its leverage over Fiyaz to pressure him to sign a series of new agreements that would limit his independence, increase his fees, and grant the company more control over his operations. Fiyaz said he felt coerced into accepting the terms, as he feared losing his livelihood or facing lawsuits. However, the new contracts did not stop the harassment from 7-Eleven, which reportedly continued to scrutinize Fiyaz's actions, demand more payments, and threaten him with legal action, even though he tried to comply with its demands.

The case of Javed Fiyaz is not unique in the world of franchising, where the power dynamics between franchisors and franchisees can be uneven and contentious. Some franchise owners have criticized the business model for being exploitative, restrictive, and opaque, and for prioritizing the interests of the corporations over those of the entrepreneurs who invest their savings, time, and energy in running the stores. In recent years, the fractures between franchisees and franchisors have led to numerous lawsuits, protests, and advocacy groups that seek to reform the industry.

The article in The New York Times sheds light on the challenges that franchise owners face when dealing with a corporate giant like 7-Eleven, which has more than 9,000 stores worldwide and a reputation for being aggressive in enforcing its rules. It also shows how the concept of franchising, which promises autonomy and support to small business owners, can be undermined by the corporate culture and incentives that prioritize revenue and compliance over innovation and trust. Whether Fiyaz's case will spark changes in the franchising industry or lead to more scrutiny on the practices of 7-Eleven remains to be seen, but it illustrates the potential risks and rewards of being a franchise owner in a complex and competitive market.
