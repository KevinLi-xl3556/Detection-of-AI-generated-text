For Trump, a Risky Decision on Suleimani Is One Other Presidents Had Avoided

On January 3rd, President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Qasem Suleimani, a top Iranian General. This decision has been met with both praise and criticism from political leaders and citizens alike. Some have dubbed it a decisive move against a dangerous adversary while others argue it was an unnecessary escalation of tensions in an already volatile region. 

One thing is certain: Trump's decision to take out Suleimani is a move that previous presidents had avoided. Suleimani was a high-ranking official in a foreign government, and killing leaders like him has traditionally been viewed as the last resort of combat. While there have been many attempts on the lives of foreign leaders in the past, none have been as blatant and publicized as this one. 

The decision to target Suleimani was certainly a risky one. Iran has promised retaliation, and many experts believe that this move has put America on the brink of war. Furthermore, the killing of such an important Iranian official threatens to destabilize the entire region, which could have serious ramifications for the United States and the world as a whole. 

However, it is worth noting that Suleimani was not just any foreign leader. He was a notorious figure responsible for many attacks on American troops and interests in the Middle East. He was also notorious for his support of terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, which has been responsible for countless attacks on Israel. 

While the decision to take out Suleimani may have been risky, it is hard to imagine how any president could have ignored such a threat. The Trump administration clearly believed that the threat posed by Suleimani was too great to be ignored, and they took action accordingly. 

Still, the decision has led to questions about whether it was the right one. Many critics argue that there is no clear strategy for dealing with the fallout from Suleimani's death. They argue that Trump's decision was impulsive and could lead to more conflict down the road. Some wonder if this move was simply a way for Trump to distract from his ongoing impeachment trial. 

Regardless of the justification for the strike, the decision to target Suleimani is one that other presidents had avoided. It speaks to Trump's willingness to take bold actions, even when they come with high risks. While the world waits to see what the fallout from the strike will be, it is clear that this decision will be remembered for years to come.
