As the labor movement in the United States continues to evolve and face new challenges, some activists and leaders are turning to the past for guidance on how to move forward. For Julia Reichert, a filmmaker and activist with decades of experience in the labor movement, this means exploring the stories and struggles of the rank-and-file workers who have been at the forefront of labor battles for generations.

Reichert has spent much of her career documenting the lives and struggles of working people, from coal miners and factory workers to nurses and teachers. Her films, including the Academy Award-nominated "Union Maids" and "Seeing Red: Stories of American Communists," tell the stories of ordinary workers who have often been overlooked by mainstream history.

For Reichert, these stories offer critical lessons for a labor movement that is facing new challenges and new opportunities in the 21st century. As she recently told The New York Times, "We need to understand where we come from in order to move into the future."

One of the key insights that Reichert draws from the labor movement's history is the importance of rank-and-file organizing. For much of the 20th century, unions were able to win major victories for working people by mobilizing grassroots support and building solidarity across different industries and communities. This approach helped to build strong, democratic unions that were able to confront the power of employers and push for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.

However, in recent years, many unions have become more bureaucratic and top-down, with paid staff taking on more of the organizing work and rank-and-file members feeling disconnected from the union's decision-making process. Reichert argues that this shift has weakened the labor movement's ability to mobilize workers and build strong alliances across different sectors.

To address this challenge, Reichert believes that unions need to invest in training and developing new generations of organizers who can effectively engage with workers and build grassroots support. This means focusing on issues that are relevant to workers' everyday lives, such as healthcare, affordable housing, and racial justice, and building broad-based alliances that can bring together different communities and movements.

Reichert's approach has resonated with many activists and organizers who are looking for new ways to revitalize the labor movement in the face of ongoing attacks from politicians and employers. Her work reminds us that the labor movement has a rich history of struggle and solidarity, and that by tapping into that legacy, we can build a more just and equitable future for all working people.
