The start of a new year is usually associated with making resolutions. Most of us promise to save money, lose weight, or learn a new skill. But how many of us ever think of making a resolution to be coached? 

Coaching is often associated with sports teams or executives, but the truth is coaching can benefit anyone who wants to improve their life. Coaching can help you clarify goals, develop a plan of action, and hold you accountable for achieving what you want. 

Making a resolution to be coached can be intimidating for some people. It requires vulnerability and a willingness to ask for help. You might worry about being judged, or think that asking for help is a sign of weakness. But the reality is, being coached takes courage and strength. 

Coaches are trained to help you identify and overcome obstacles that may be holding you back. They can offer an objective perspective, provide support and encouragement, and help you develop new strategies for success. With a coach's help, you can take your life to the next level. 

If you're ready to make the resolution to be coached, start by doing some research. There are countless coaches out there, each with their own style and area of expertise. Look for someone who you feel comfortable talking to, who has experience in the area that you want to work on, and who offers a clear coaching plan. 

Once you've found a coach that you want to work with, be prepared to invest time and energy in the process. Coaching is not a magic pill that will fix all your problems overnight. It takes dedication and hard work to see results. But with consistent effort, you'll start to see progress and positive changes in your life. 

Finally, be open and honest with your coach. Share your goals, fears, and struggles. Remember, your coach is there to help you, not judge you. When you're open and honest, your coach can offer the most effective support and guidance. 

Making the resolution to be coached can be life-changing. It can help you achieve your goals, overcome challenges, and live your best life. With the right coach by your side, 2021 can be the year that you finally make the changes you've been dreaming of.
