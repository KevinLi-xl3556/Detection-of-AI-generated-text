For over a century, a reading of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit has been considered the “normal” temperature for the human body. This benchmark was established by German physician Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich in 1851, based on his study of around 25,000 patients. However, recent studies suggest that this figure may no longer be accurate, and that we should rethink what we consider a healthy body temperature.

Scientists from Stanford University have published a study in the journal eLife, which reveals that the average body temperature has dropped since Wunderlich’s data was collected. The researchers analyzed temperature data from 677,423 temperature measurements, taken between 1862 and 2017. They found that the average temperature in the early 2000s was around 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit – a full degree lower than the traditional “normal” reading.

The study authors suggest that our bodies are cooling down over time, possibly because we are no longer exposed to as many infections as our ancestors were. The immune system is no longer under constant attack, so it doesn’t need to constantly rev up the body’s temperature to deal with pathogens.

This study is not the first to suggest that the normal body temperature may have shifted. Another study was published in 1992, which found that the average temperature in men in the United States had dropped by 0.59 degrees Fahrenheit over the previous century.

But what does this mean for the average person? Should we be worried that we have a lower temperature than our predecessors? Experts say that we shouldn’t panic. A lower temperature is not necessarily a sign of ill health – in fact, many people with lower temperatures are perfectly healthy. Plus, it’s worth remembering that body temperatures can vary throughout the day, and can depend on factors such as age, activity level, and even the time of year.

There are some cases where having a lower body temperature could be a concern, such as if you are experiencing other symptoms such as chills, fatigue, or a headache. In these cases, it’s best to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.

Overall, it seems that our understanding of what is “normal” when it comes to body temperature may need to be updated. While 98.6 degrees has been considered the standard for over a century, research suggests that this figure may no longer be relevant. Ultimately, it’s important to remember that everyone’s body is unique, and what is “normal” for one person may not be the same for another.
