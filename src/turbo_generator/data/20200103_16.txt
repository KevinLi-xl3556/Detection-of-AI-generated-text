On Sunday, the Dallas Cowboys announced that Jason Garrett, the team’s head coach for the past nine seasons, has been fired. The decision came after a week of uncertainty and speculation about Garrett's future with the team.

Garrett's tenure with the Cowboys has been a mixed bag of highs and lows. In his first full season as head coach in 2011, he led the team to a record of 8-8 and narrowly missed out on a playoff berth. However, he guided the team to the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, winning the NFC East both times.

Despite the early success, the Cowboys struggled to maintain their momentum under Garrett, failing to qualify for the playoffs in four of the past five seasons. The team finished this season with a record of 8-8, again missing out on the playoffs.

The decision to fire Garrett was not surprising, given the team's disappointing results this season. However, what was surprising—and frustrating for both the team and its fans—was the prolonged period of uncertainty leading up to the announcement.

Following the end of the regular season, Garrett met with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to discuss his future with the team. Jones was reportedly undecided about what to do with Garrett, who's contract was set to expire on January 14th.

Despite the uncertainty, the Cowboys have been actively exploring other coaching options, interviewing several potential candidates including Marvin Lewis, the former head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals.

Garrett was also considered for other head coaching vacancies around the league including the New York Giants, however, it seems that he will not be returning to Dallas in any capacity.

With the Cowboys' coaching situation now resolved, the focus turns to finding a new head coach who can lead the team back to the playoffs and beyond. The Cowboys have a talented roster with the likes of quarterback Dak Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliott, and wide receiver Amari Cooper, but they will need a coach who can effectively manage these players and maximize their potential.

The coming weeks and months will be a crucial time for the Dallas Cowboys as they look to move on from the Jason Garrett era and embark on a new era of success under a new head coach.
