As the new year begins, many of us make resolutions to improve ourselves and our lives. However, we often struggle to stick to these resolutions, and they end up falling by the wayside after only a few weeks or months. So how can we make our new year’s resolutions count?

First, it’s important to set realistic goals. Don’t try to completely overhaul your life overnight. Instead, focus on small, achievable changes that will lead to bigger improvements over time. For example, instead of resolving to lose 50 pounds, start with a goal of going for a 20-minute walk each day.

Next, hold yourself accountable by tracking your progress. Write down your goals and track your progress in a journal, on a calendar, or through an app. Seeing your progress can be motivating and help you stay on track.

It’s also helpful to share your goals with others. Find a friend or family member who shares your goals or can support you in achieving them. You can also join a support group or online community to connect with others who are working toward similar goals.

Finally, be kind to yourself if you slip up. Everyone has setbacks and moments of weakness. Don’t let a temporary setback derail your progress. Instead, use it as a learning opportunity and get back on track as soon as possible.

Making your new year’s resolutions count doesn’t have to be daunting. Set small, achievable goals, hold yourself accountable, share your goals with others, and be kind to yourself – and watch as your life improves one step at a time.
