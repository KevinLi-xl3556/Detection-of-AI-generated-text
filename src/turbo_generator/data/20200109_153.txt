Based on a true story, the film ‘Three Christs’ follows the journey of Dr. Alan Stone (played by Richard Gere), a psychiatrist who attempts to treat three individuals who all believe they are Jesus Christ. Set in 1959, the film is a thought-provoking exploration of mental illness and the limitations of psychiatric treatment.

Director Jon Avnet does a masterful job of bringing the audience into the minds of his three main characters. The film is rich in psychological detail, with each character experiencing a unique form of delusion that is both heart-wrenching and fascinating to watch.

While each of the three characters presents a different manifestation of their mental illness, the film also takes a broader look at the treatments available to them in the late 1950s. Dr. Stone attempts to treat his patients with empathy and understanding, but faced with limited options like electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy, he realizes that he is not equipped to fully understand or treat their conditions.

Richard Gere delivers a powerful performance as Dr. Stone, convincingly portraying a physician struggling to reconcile his human empathy with the clinical rigor of his profession. The supporting cast, which includes Peter Dinklage, Bradley Whitford, and Walton Goggins, all give standout performances as the three patients.

Ultimately, ‘Three Christs’ is a film about compassion and the limitations of the human mind. The film poses difficult questions about mental illness and the treatment options available to those suffering from it, questions that are still relevant today. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the mysteries of the human mind and the power of empathy in treating mental illness.
