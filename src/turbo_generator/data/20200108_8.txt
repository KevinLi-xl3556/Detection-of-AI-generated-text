In a world where social media is king, the power of a Facebook article cannot be underestimated. This is why it was strange when Teen Vogue’s Facebook post about Facebook’s role in the 2016 election mysteriously vanished.

The article, titled “How Facebook Is Helping Ensure the Integrity of the 2016 Election,” was published on December 1st, 2016. It was a well-researched and well-written piece that showed how Facebook’s algorithms could be manipulated to sway the outcome of an election.

However, just over a week later, the article was gone. When users clicked on the link, they were greeted with an error message. This led to speculation that Facebook had censored the article, as it could be seen as critical of the company’s algorithm.

Teen Vogue, meanwhile, denied any censorship had taken place, stating that the article had been removed due to “technical errors.”

The disappearance of the article sparked outrage online, with many wondering if Facebook had something to do with it. Others were suspicious of Teen Vogue’s explanation, suggesting that the magazine’s parent company, Conde Nast, had pulled the article in order to appease Facebook.

Despite the controversy, the article’s contents can still be found online. In the article, the author suggests that Facebook’s algorithm is flawed and can be manipulated to spread false information. This is particularly concerning in the context of elections, as it means that elections can be won and lost based on false information.

Since the controversy, Facebook has faced increased scrutiny over its role in the 2016 election. The social media giant has been accused of enabling the spread of fake news and false information, leading to the election of Donald Trump.

The disappearance of Teen Vogue’s Facebook article serves as a reminder of the power that social media companies have over the information that we see online. It also highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability from these companies.

As we head into another election season, it is more important than ever that we are able to trust the information that we see online. Only then can we ensure that our democratic process remains intact.
