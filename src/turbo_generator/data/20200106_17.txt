The killing of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani by the United States on January 3, 2020, has sparked outrage and debate across the globe. The airstrike authorized by President Trump has been called a reckless act of aggression by some, and a necessary move to protect American interests by others. However, what is clear is that this escalation of tensions between the US and Iran did not happen overnight. Rather, a series of steps taken by both countries over the past few months and years have led us to this moment.

One significant step was the US’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal. The JCPOA was a multilateral agreement reached in 2015 between Iran and several world powers, including the US, aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear abilities in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. President Trump and his administration viewed the deal as flawed and insufficient, and withdrew from it unilaterally, despite objections from other signatories.

This move, in turn, led to a reimposition of economic sanctions on Iran by the US. The sanctions targeted Iran’s oil exports, banking system, and other industries, causing significant harm to the Iranian economy. In response, Iran increased its nuclear activity beyond the limits set by the JCPOA and resumed enriching uranium.

Iran also began an aggressive campaign of attacking oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and seizing ships, which it claimed were evading sanctions. The US accused Iran of being responsible for these attacks, which Iran denied. These incidents exacerbated tensions between the two countries, with the US sending additional troops and military equipment to the region to deter further provocations.

Then, in late December 2019, a rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq killed an American contractor and injured several others. The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia for the attack and responded with airstrikes against the group’s bases. In retaliation, the militia and other Iranian-backed forces stormed the US embassy in Baghdad, leading to a tense standoff that lasted several days.

It was during this time that President Trump decided to take decisive action and ordered the airstrike that killed General Suleimani, who he claimed was planning further attacks on American interests.

One can argue that each of these steps, taken by both the US and Iran, were responses to the other’s actions. However, what is clear is that they have led us to a dangerous point where the risk of a full-blown conflict between the two countries has increased significantly. The killing of General Suleimani has only added to this risk.

Moving forward, it is essential for both countries to take steps to deescalate the situation and open channels of communication to avoid further violence. Diplomacy and dialogue must take precedence over militaristic actions and rhetoric. The stakes are too high for us to allow this situation to spiral out of control.
