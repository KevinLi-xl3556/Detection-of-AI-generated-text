In a recent announcement in The New York Times, multiple publishers have withdrawn from an upcoming romance conference, citing concerns about a lack of diversity in the event.

The conference in question, The Romance Writers of America (RWA) conference, has been facing criticism for its handling of issues related to diversity and inclusion. In particular, several authors and industry professionals have raised concerns about the representation of writers of color within the organization, as well as issues related to discrimination and unequal treatment.

In a statement to The New York Times, publishers including Kensington Publishing and Avon Books cited these concerns as the reason for their decision to withdraw from the conference. They expressed a desire to support more inclusive and diverse events in the future.

This decision comes on the heels of a recent controversy within the RWA involving allegations of racism and discrimination against an author of color. The RWA board initially defended its handling of the situation, but faced backlash from members and sponsors who felt that the organization was not doing enough to address the underlying issues.

In response to the publisher withdrawals, RWA released a statement acknowledging the need to address diversity and inclusion within the organization. The statement emphasized that the RWA is committed to creating a more diverse and equitable community, and is actively working to address the concerns raised by members of the organization.

This incident highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the publishing industry in creating a more diverse and inclusive landscape. While progress has been made in recent years, many writers and industry professionals continue to face barriers related to factors such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability.

Moving forward, it will be essential for organizations such as RWA to prioritize diversity and inclusion in all aspects of their work. Publishers and authors alike must work together to create a more inclusive industry that reflects the full range of human experiences and perspectives, and that uplifts and amplifies marginalized voices. Only then can we hope to create a world of literature that truly represents and celebrates the diversity of our shared humanity.
