The world was in shock when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made the unexpected announcement of their intention to step back from their royal duties. It was a move that left many scratching their heads, trying to understand the reasoning behind this unusual decision.

One could argue that this once-in-a-lifetime move was motivated by love. The couple, who had been married for less than two years, had taken a bold step towards a life together, unencumbered by the weight of royal traditions and obligations.

Since their wedding in May 2018, the couple faced intense scrutiny from the British press, which Harry, in a statement he released in October 2019, described as “a relentless propaganda”. The couple felt that they were unfairly targeted by the press, which led to a strain on their mental health.

The couple’s decision to step back as senior royals and to no longer receive public funds was not taken lightly. The couple consulted with The Queen, Prince Charles and other members of the royal family before announcing their decision, which was met with mixed reactions.

While some saw it as a betrayal of tradition, others applauded the couple for taking a progressive step in their lives. Their decision to pursue a life outside the royal family resonated with people across the globe who admired the couple’s courage and determination to prioritize their mental health and family.

Their decision to relocate to North America, a continent Meghan Markle calls home, was seen as a sign of their commitment to building a life together. The couple intends to be financially independent and set up a charitable organization focusing on issues such as mental health, well-being, and women’s empowerment.

It is clear that the couple’s decision was motivated by love and a desire to create a better life for themselves and their family. They have made a bold move, one that will likely have far-reaching consequences for the royal family and the British monarchy.

In conclusion, the love between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has been a driving force in the couple’s decision to step back from their royal duties. As they embark on this new journey, there is no doubt that their love for each other will continue to be a defining characteristic of their lives.
