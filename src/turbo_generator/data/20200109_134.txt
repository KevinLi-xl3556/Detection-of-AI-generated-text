In yet another blow to environmental protections, the Trump administration has moved to roll back a key law that has been instrumental in safeguarding the country’s natural resources for the past five decades. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has been a landmark law, requiring federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of their actions and to consider alternative courses of action that may be more beneficial to public health and ecological well-being. But the Trump administration’s ongoing war on environmental regulations has led to a weakening of many of these safeguards, including NEPA.

On Wednesday, the White House announced new rules aimed at dismantling NEPA’s requirements, and limiting public participation in the decision-making process. Such changes are expected to make it easier for federal agencies to approve projects that have harmful environmental impacts, such as oil and gas drilling, mining, and other extractive activities that can have far-reaching consequences on air and water quality, and overall habitat destruction.

The Trump administration has consistently prioritized industry interests over environmental protection, under the guise of promoting economic growth and job creation. However, research suggests that weakening NEPA and other environmental laws may only serve to benefit a small group of private industry players, while endangering the health and well-being of communities across the country. In many cases, marginalized communities are often the most severely impacted by environmental degradation, and have the least say in decision-making processes.

The National Environmental Policy Act has been instrumental in shaping US environmental policy, and has paved the way for important environmental protections such as the Clean Air and Water Acts, and the Endangered Species Act. Its repeal would be a significant setback for decades of progress towards safeguarding our environment and natural resources.

However, communities and environmental groups have been quick to respond with calls to action, urging lawmakers and advocates to stand up for the protection of the country’s natural heritage. As the Trump administration continues to push for environmental rollbacks at an unprecedented pace, and with the coming 2020 election shaping up as a critical battle for the future of the environment and public health, it is more important than ever to remain vigilant in the fight for environmental protections.
