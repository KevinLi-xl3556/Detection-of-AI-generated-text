On January 7th, at around 4:24 am, the southern coast of Puerto Rico was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake, causing damage to thousands of homes and infrastructure, leaving many without electricity, water and basic services.  In the aftermath of the quake, Puerto Ricans are asking themselves one question: Are we safe?

The island, which is still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, is now facing another disaster. The earthquake comes at a time when Puerto Ricans feel their government has abandoned them. The island, which has been in a financial crisis for years, has also been neglected by the Trump administration, causing even more frustration.

Many have taken to social media to vent their anger and frustration, using the hashtag #TremorsPR to share stories and pictures of the destruction. The scenes are similar to those seen in Hurricane Maria, with homes destroyed and people sleeping in the streets.

But this time, the fear is different. Many are questioning the safety of their homes and buildings, as many structures were damaged or collapsed in the earthquake. People are also questioning the competence of the government in handling the disaster, as many felt the response was slow and uncoordinated.

The earthquake has also highlighted the vulnerability of the island's infrastructure, with many schools and hospitals being forced to close due to structural damage. The islandâ€™s power grid, which was already fragile, suffered significant damage, leaving thousands without power.

The situation in Puerto Rico is a reminder that disasters can happen anywhere, at any time. However, this is also a reminder that the most vulnerable communities are often the hardest hit. In Puerto Rico, many of the most vulnerable are still living in homes that were damaged by Hurricane Maria over two years ago. The quake has once again exposed the deep inequalities that exist in Puerto Rico and the urgent need for action to address them.

Despite the challenges, Puerto Ricans are resilient and have once again come together to help each other out. Communities have opened their doors to those who lost their homes and volunteers from across the island have mobilized to provide aid and comfort.

In the face of adversity, Puerto Ricans are asking the tough questions and demanding answers. They are also showing the world that, despite the neglect and hardship, they are strong and will rebuild.
