‘It’s Harder to Fight When You’re Naked’ - The New York Times

In the era of #MeToo and Time’s Up, sexual harassment and assault survivors have challenged prevailing norms of power and consent in the workplace, the media, and the culture at large. They have exposed systemic abuses of authority, gender bias, and silence that too often protected perpetrators and punished victims. They have also inspired a deeper reflection on the meaning of consent and the role of sexuality in human relationships. 

In a recent article in The New York Times, entitled ‘It’s Harder to Fight When You’re Naked,’ writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner explores the complexities of consent and coercion in the context of intimate encounters. Drawing on her own experience as well as interviews with therapists, advocates, and survivors, she examines the blurred lines between desire and fear, pleasure and pain, and consent and complicity that can shape sexual dynamics. 

Brodesser-Akner’s article begins with a personal anecdote about a sexual encounter she had with a man who ignored her boundaries and coerced her into performing a sexual act that left her feeling violated and confused. She explains how she struggled to articulate her feelings about the incident, and how she eventually came to see it as a form of assault that revealed her vulnerability and his abuse of power. She also reflects on the cultural and psychological factors that make it harder for women to speak up and for men to understand the impact of their actions. 

The article then delves into the wider issue of sexual consent, using examples from popular culture, therapy practices, and legal cases to illustrate the nuances of communication, context, and power that can influence how people understand and negotiate sex. Brodesser-Akner acknowledges that while many sexual encounters involve clear and enthusiastic consent, others can be more ambiguous, pressured, or fraught with emotion. She also notes that many survivors of sexual assault blame themselves for not resisting or reporting the abuse, even though they were not responsible for it. 

To address these issues, Brodesser-Akner advocates for a more nuanced and empathic approach to sexuality that recognizes the diversity of experiences and perspectives involved. She suggests that people need to communicate more effectively about their desires, boundaries, and limits, and to respect and validate each other’s feelings and identities. She also calls for more education on consent and pleasure, and for more resources for survivors of assault and harassment. 

Overall, ‘It’s Harder to Fight When You’re Naked’ offers a thoughtful and timely analysis of the challenges and opportunities of sexual consent in a changing social landscape. By sharing her own story and listening to others, Brodesser-Akner helps us to see the humanity and complexity in every sexual encounter, and to affirm the importance of mutual respect and dignity in all aspects of our lives.
