The assassination of Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian military commander, by the United States in January 2020 was a significant event in global politics. While the decision to kill Suleimani was controversial, it was widely reported on and discussed in the media at the time. However, more than a year later, a new story has emerged about the event that has caused some concern.

According to a recent article in The New York Times, the Trump campaign has been promoting the killing of Suleimani on Facebook in the days following the event. The campaign reportedly ran ads on Facebook that featured a photo of the slain commander, along with the message "This was the right call."

The ads were seen by millions of people and generated thousands of comments and reactions. While some people expressed support for the Trump administration's decision to target Suleimani, others questioned the legality, morality, and long-term consequences of such an action.

The fact that the Trump campaign is promoting the killing of a foreign military leader on social media has raised some eyebrows. Critics argue that this move is unethical, as it undermines the principles of international law and diplomacy. Moreover, the promotion of violence and military action through social media sets a dangerous precedent and can further escalate tensions and conflicts in the world.

It is worth noting that promoting violence or portraying violence as a solution to political problems is a violation of Facebook's community guidelines. As such, the Trump campaign's ads could potentially be flagged as inappropriate or misleading. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Facebook will take any action, given their history of allowing political campaigns to run controversial ads.

The promotion of the Suleimani killing on Facebook also raises questions about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and discourse. Social media platforms have become powerful tools for political campaigns and interest groups to communicate with voters, mobilize supporters, and influence the public narrative. However, the use of social media for promoting violence or propaganda undermines the integrity and credibility of these platforms and harms democratic values.

In the end, the Trump campaign's promotion of the Suleimani killing on Facebook is a troubling development that highlights the need for responsible and ethical use of social media in politics. It is up to Facebook and other social media platforms to ensure that their policies and practices align with democratic principles and international norms. Meanwhile, it is up to the public to remain vigilant and critical of the messages they consume and the actions they endorse online.
