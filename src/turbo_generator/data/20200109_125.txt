In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. We get bogged down in our routines, in our work, and in our technology. But artist and writer, Austin Kleon, has a message for all of us: stay curious and keep exploring.

In an article featured in The New York Times, Kleon shared his perspective on why curiosity is the key to creativity. He notes that when we start to see the world in different ways, it can help us break free from our usual patterns of thinking and unlock our imagination.

As a writer myself, Kleon’s words really resonated with me. It can be so easy to get stuck in a writing rut, using the same phrases and ideas over and over again. But taking a step back and looking at things from a different angle can help me see new possibilities and opportunities.

Kleon’s advice is to stay curious and keep exploring in order to foster creativity. This can mean exploring new places, trying out new hobbies or simply spending time with people who have different perspectives than us. By doing this, we can keep our minds open and receptive to new ideas.

It’s not always easy to step outside of our comfort zones, but that’s where the growth happens. Kleon notes that he often feels uncomfortable when he starts exploring something new, but he pushes through it. It’s important to remember that discomfort is a sign that we’re learning and growing.

In conclusion, if you’re feeling stuck in your writing or any other creative pursuit, take a cue from Austin Kleon and stay curious. Keep exploring and looking at the world in a different way. As he wisely notes, “I’m finished when I start looking at the world in a different way”.
