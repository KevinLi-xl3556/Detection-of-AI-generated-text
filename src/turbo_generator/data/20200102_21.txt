As the weekend approaches in New York City, there are plenty of entertainment options to choose from. For those who enjoy a good laugh, the city’s comedy scene is always buzzing with a variety of shows and performances. Here are five comedy shows you don’t want to miss this weekend.

1. Comedy Cellar - Greenwich Village
The Comedy Cellar is perhaps the most well-known comedy club in NYC. It’s where many of the biggest names in comedy (think Louis C.K, Chris Rock, and Amy Schumer) got their start, and it continues to attract some of the best comedians in the business. With multiple shows throughout the day and night, it’s always a good time to catch some laughs here.

2. Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre - Chelsea
The UCB Theatre is another famous destination for comedy in NYC. It’s where stars like Aziz Ansari, Donald Glover, and Ellie Kemper first made their mark. The theatre’s live improv and sketch comedy shows are sure to keep you laughing all night long, and the tickets are quite affordable too.

3. The Stand Comedy Club - Union Square
The Stand is a newer addition to the comedy scene in NYC, but it’s already made a name for itself by offering stand-up performances from some of the most hilarious comedians in the business. The intimate atmosphere of the club is perfect for a night out with friends or a first date, and their bar menu is something to behold as well.

4. The Bell House - Gowanus
Located in Brooklyn, The Bell House is another venue that’s quickly secured its spot as a go-to spot for comedy in NYC. This weekend they’re hosting the sold-out show "Butterboy" - a weekly comedy showcase hosted by Jo Firestone, Aparna Nancherla, and Maeve Higgins. It’s always a surprise who will make an appearance each week, but audiences can expect to see some of the brightest stars in comedy.
