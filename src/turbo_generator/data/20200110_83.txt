Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State of the United States, announced on Friday that the United States is imposing economic sanctions on Iran in response to the recent missile attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq.

The announcement comes as tensions between the United States and Iran continue to mount, following the killing of Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, in a drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump.

Pompeo has been steadfast in his assertion that the United States faced an imminent threat from Iran, and that the decision to kill Soleimani was necessary to protect American lives.

"The decision to impose sanctions on Iran is a response to the continued threat posed by the Iranian regime to the United States and our allies," Pompeo said in a statement.

"These sanctions will deny the Iranian regime access to critical resources that it needs to further its illicit activities, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and support for terrorism."

The sanctions will target eight senior Iranian officials, including Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, and Mansour Fakih, a key figure in Iran's ballistic missile program.

In addition, the sanctions will also impact companies and individuals that provide support to the Iranian regime, including companies involved in the construction of Iran's nuclear program.

The move is likely to further strain the already-tense relations between the United States and Iran, which have been on edge since the Soleimani strike.

Iran has vowed to retaliate against the United States for Soleimani's killing, and has launched multiple missile attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq in recent weeks.

The decision to impose sanctions on Iran is likely to be seen as an escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two nations, and it remains to be seen how Iran will respond.

The United States has maintained that it is not seeking a military conflict with Iran, but rather is acting in self-defense to protect American lives.

However, critics argue that the Trump administration's handling of the situation has been reckless, and that the decision to target Soleimani without consulting Congress or allies has only made matters worse.

As tensions between the United States and Iran continue to mount, it is clear that the situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The imposition of sanctions is just the latest chapter in what is likely to be a long and difficult relationship between the two nations.
