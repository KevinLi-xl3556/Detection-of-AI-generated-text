On Wednesday, Russia and Turkey called for an immediate cease-fire in Libya, after months of fighting and external intervention from the two countries. A joint statement was issued by the leaders, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, expressing their concern for the ongoing situation in the country.

The statement encouraged all parties involved in the conflict to stop their hostilities, and called for an end to foreign intervention in Libya, an indirect reference to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia's support for General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Haftar has been fighting for control of Libya since 2014, with the backing of several foreign powers.

The call for a cease-fire comes after weeks of intense battles between Haftar's forces and the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is supported by Turkey, a development that has rapidly escalated the conflict. The GNA has succeeded in pushing back Haftar’s forces, and they are now on the outskirts of the strategic city of Sirte. There are concerns that a full-scale military confrontation between the GNA and Haftar’s forces could lead to a humanitarian crisis, given the country’s precarious economic and social situation.

Russia and Turkey have been heavily involved in the Libyan conflict. The Kremlin has been accused of sending mercenaries and weapons to support Haftar's forces, while Turkey has sent military advisors and troops to support the GNA. The two countries’ intervention in the conflict has drawn criticism from the international community, which has warned that their involvement could destabilize the country further.

Despite their differences, Russia and Turkey have been trying to find a solution to the conflict through diplomatic means. In January, the two countries organized an international summit in Moscow which brought together representatives from the GNA and Haftar's forces. However, the peace talks collapsed after Haftar refused to sign the agreement.

The joint statement from Putin and Erdogan marks a renewed effort to find a political solution to the conflict. It is uncertain if the two countries' call for a cease-fire will be heeded by the warring factions in Libya. Nevertheless, it is a positive step towards the resolution of the conflict, and a sign that Russia and Turkey are committed to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis.
