Fans of Steve McQueen's iconic car chase in the 1968 film "Bullitt" will be thrilled to learn that the original 1968 Ford Mustang GT driven by the actor is heading to auction. The car, which was used in the unforgettable high-speed chase scene, is scheduled to cross the auction block in January 2020.

For nearly 50 years, the Bullitt Mustang was thought to be lost, but it resurfaced in 2018, when it was revealed that the original car had been hidden away in a barn in Nashville, Tennessee. The car was in remarkably intact condition, and after a lengthy restoration, it was put on display at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

Now the iconic vehicle is set to be auctioned off by Mecum Auctions, one of the world's top providers of collector cars, motorcycles, and related memorabilia. The Bullitt Mustang GT is expected to fetch a high price, given its legendary status and the fact that it was driven by one of the most iconic actors in Hollywood history.

The car's provenance is also a factor in its value. The Bullitt Mustang GT was purchased by McQueen himself, and remained in his possession until 1978. It was then sold to a New Jersey detective, who kept it until 2017, when it was purchased by the current owner.

The Bullitt Mustang GT is powered by a 390-cubic-inch V8 engine, and features a four-speed manual transmission. Its exterior is painted in Highland Green, with a black interior. The car is also equipped with a number of performance modifications, including a heavy-duty suspension and brakes.

Despite its modifications, the Bullitt Mustang GT has been meticulously restored to its original condition by a team of experts who worked to ensure that every detail of the car was faithfully recreated. As a result, the car looks as good today as it did when it first appeared on the silver screen over 50 years ago.

The auction of the Bullitt Mustang GT is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for fans of the film, car enthusiasts, and collectors alike. The chance to own a piece of Hollywood history is not to be missed, and the winning bidder will undoubtedly treasure this iconic vehicle for years to come.
