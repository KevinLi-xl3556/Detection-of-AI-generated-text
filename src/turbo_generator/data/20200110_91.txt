As we move into the new year, many of us are looking to refresh our cooking repertoire and find some new dishes to enjoy. But sometimes, the most comforting and satisfying meals are the ones we already know and love. That's why The New York Times has compiled a list of recipes worth putting on repeat.

First up is Alison Roman's No-Knead Bread, which has become a sensation in recent years. With just a few ingredients and some patience, you can create a crusty, chewy loaf that's perfect for sandwiches, toast, or just slathering with butter.

Another recipe worth revisiting is Melissa Clark's One-Pot Chicken and Rice. This cozy dish is easy to make and endlessly adaptable, depending on what ingredients you have on hand. Plus, it's a one-pot wonder, which means less cleanup time.

If you're looking for something on the healthier side, consider making Martha Rose Shulman's Quinoa Salad with Pears and Spiced Walnuts. This flavorful dish is packed with protein and fiber, and the combination of sweet, tart, and spicy flavors make it a real standout.

For a meatless option, try Yewande Komolafe's Spiced Chickpeas with Roasted Vegetables. The warming spices and crispy chickpeas make for a filling and flavorful meal, and the roasted vegetables add a healthy dose of vitamins and minerals.

Last but not least, don't forget about dessert. Samin Nosrat's Tahini Cookies are a must-try. These nutty, chewy cookies are incredibly satisfying, and the sesame flavor adds a unique twist. Plus, they're gluten-free and dairy-free, so they're suitable for a wide range of dietary restrictions.

No matter what kind of cuisine you're in the mood for, these recipes are sure to please. And the best part is, once you've made them a few times, you'll have them memorized and can whip them up without even consulting the recipe. So go ahead and put them on repeat â€“ your taste buds will thank you.
