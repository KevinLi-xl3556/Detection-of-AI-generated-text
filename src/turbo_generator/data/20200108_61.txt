The Smithsonian Institution, the world-renowned museum complex in Washington D.C., is set to bring American history to life in graphic books.

This new initiative is a collaboration between the Smithsonian and the publisher Simon & Schuster, and will produce a series of graphic novels that will cover important events and periods in American history.

The goal of this partnership is to make learning about history more engaging and accessible to people of all ages. The graphic books will feature vibrant illustrations, photographs, and artwork alongside easy-to-read storytelling.

"We see these graphic books as a powerful tool to inspire and educate people about our country's rich history," said Lonnie Bunch, the Secretary of the Smithsonian. "We want to make learning about history exciting and relevant to the younger generations."

The series will begin with three titles scheduled for release in January 2021. The first book, "Action Presidents" will explore the lives of America's most influential leaders from George Washington to Barack Obama.

The second book, "World War II: The Definitive Visual History," will provide a comprehensive overview of the war with stunning illustrations and historical photographs.

The third book, "Trailblazers: The Women of American Aerospace," will highlight the contributions of women in the field of aerospace science and engineering.

This new initiative is part of the Smithsonian's ongoing efforts to reach a broader audience and make their collections and resources more accessible beyond their physical museums. The Smithsonian has also been expanding its digital initiatives in recent years, including the launch of the Smithsonian Open Access platform, which offers millions of high-resolution images of their collections for free use.

By partnering with Simon & Schuster to create graphic novels, the Smithsonian hopes to engage young readers and foster a love of history and learning that will last a lifetime. With the stunning illustrations and engaging storytelling of these books, it is hard not to be intrigued by the fascinating stories of America's past.
