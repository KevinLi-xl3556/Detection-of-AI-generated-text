On Friday, 15th of May 2020, The New York Times released an article titled "Top Education Official Planned to Meet Boy for Sex, Prosecutors Say." The report detailed a disturbing case of a high-ranking education official, David M. Hay, who allegedly orchestrated a plan to meet a 14-year-old boy for sex.

Hay, aged 49, was a former education official who had been serving as president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators in New York City. According to prosecutors, he had been in communication with an undercover police officer, whom he believed to be a 14-year-old boy.

The report stated that Hay had allegedly initiated contact with the individual on a social media platform, and their conversations soon turned sexually explicit. Over time, Hay had allegedly proposed a meeting between the two for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. 

The article further reported that Hay had sent several graphic pictures and videos of himself to the supposed teenager. He also suggested that they meet at an airport hotel, where he would bring condoms and lubrication.

However, Hay's plan was foiled when he was arrested by the authorities on Wednesday, 13th of May, 2020. Hay was subsequently charged with enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity, and he faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

The case of David M. Hay is a disturbing reminder that child predators can come from any segment of society and any profession, including high ranking officials in the field of education. The education system is designed to protect children, and those who work in it have a responsibility to provide a safe learning environment for young students.

It is crucial that all adults be alert to signs of potential abuse and that they report any suspicious behavior to the appropriate authorities. Parents also have a role to play in educating their children on the dangers of sexual predators and how to stay safe online.

This case serves as a reminder that sexual predators are still out there, and that parents, educators, and the authorities must work together to protect children from their activities. We must remain vigilant in order to ensure that our schools and communities remain a safe haven for all children.
