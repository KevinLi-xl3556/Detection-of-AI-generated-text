The New York Times is a leading source of news and information in the world. One of the areas that are well-covered by the Times is the experiences and opinions of teenagers. Through December 2019, the Times published several articles that highlighted different issues that teenagers face within the United States.

One of the most notable stories involved climate change activism, which was driven mainly by teenagers. The article, titled "Climate Change Activism by Teenagers Takes Hold Worldwide," outlined how teenagers worldwide are coming together to fight climate change. The article highlighted Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old from Sweden who was leading the movement worldwide.

Another story focused on the issue of bullying within schools. The story, titled "How to Talk With Teenagers About Vaping and Bullying," discussed the challenges that parents face when trying to talk with their kids about vaping and the effects of bullying. It revealed that many teenagers are unaware of the health effects associated with vaping, and some become victims of bullying because they don't have the confidence to speak up.

In contrast, a third story titled "For Teenagers, ‘Oklahoma!’ Is Both ‘A Dream Come True’ and a Throwback" praised the decision by a high school in New Jersey to hold a musical theater version of the famed Broadway classic. The decision was significant since many teenagers were not familiar with the musical, and it introduced them to classic literature.

As a reflection of the diversity of issues facing teenagers, another story titled "Queer Teens Find Help in a ‘Rainbow Club’" highlighted the significance of support organizations such as the Rainbow Club that help LGBTQ teenagers. The article detailed how the club served as a space for teenagers to share their experiences and receive support from others who understood their struggles.

In summary, the stories published in December 2019 demonstrate that teenagers face various issues ranging from bullying to climate change. The New York Times continues to be a critical source of information that explores these issues and provides valuable insights into the different perspectives of teenagers.
