On New Year's Eve, a devastating fire broke out at the Krefeld Zoo in Germany, killing more than 30 animals including apes, monkeys and birds. Emergency responders and firefighters worked overnight to try and save the animals, but unfortunately, many could not be saved. The exact cause of the fire was not immediately known, but it has now been determined that flying lanterns were the cause.

According to the latest report by The New York Times, three women had gone to ring in the New Year at the nearby Kleve, and decided to light flying lanterns as part of their celebration. These lanterns, also known as sky lanterns or Chinese lanterns, are made of paper or cloth and have a small candle or fuel cell inside them. They are typically released into the sky and float away, but they pose a significant fire risk as they can land anywhere and start a fire.

The paper and bamboo flying lanterns used on New Year’s Eve are the traditional form of sky lanterns used all over the world. They are a popular accessory for festive occasions, especially in Asian countries. They are also popular in the Western hemisphere, particularly for events such as weddings, birthdays, and other celebrations.

Due to the strong winds, some of the lanterns' landed in the Krefeld Zoo, which was closed at the time. The lanterns caused a fire in the monkey house, which soon spread to other parts of the zoo. Unfortunately, the fire was able to take hold and spread because the zoo was closed and no one was there to raise the alarm until the blaze had already taken hold.

The Krefeld Zoo is devastated by the loss of life that occurred during the incident, and it has issued a statement saying that it will work on rebuilding the zoo and the lives lost. The tragedy could have been avoided if people had taken precautions and not used the lanterns in conditions that could cause a fire, especially during a period where high winds were predicted.

Flying lanterns have been banned in several countries, including Austria, Australia, Spain, Germany, and the United States. In many countries where they are not banned, authorities require people to obtain a permit before releasing them. It is important that the authorities in all countries restrict the sale and use of sky lanterns and take stronger enforcement action to prevent such tragic accidents from happening in the future.

In conclusion, while flying lanterns may seem like innocent fun, it is important to remember the potentially deadly consequences that come with using them. The tragedy that occurred at the Krefeld Zoo serves as a powerful reminder that we must be responsible when using these items, especially during periods of high wind. It is important that the use of flying lanterns is prohibited to avoid such devastating incidents from occurring again. We must respect the environment and other people’s property and ensure that we do not let the innocent fun turn into a tragedy.
