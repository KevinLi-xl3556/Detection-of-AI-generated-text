On January 8, 2020, a Ukrainian passenger airplane, Flight PS752, was shot down by Iranian military forces shortly after taking off from Tehran's airport, killing all 176 people on board. Three months later, the incident is still being investigated, and conflicting information has left the world wondering who is to blame and what actions should be taken.

Iran initially denied any involvement and claimed the crash was due to technical difficulties. However, after evidence mounted showing a missile strike, Iran admitted its mistake and claimed it was due to human error. Iran pointed to "unintentional missile firing" in the "heightened state of readiness" caused by the escalation of tensions with the United States as the cause.

The United States, on the other hand, has blamed Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which operates Iran's missile defense. The Pentagon has accused the IRGC of using two missile systems to down the plane, including the Russian-made Tor-M1.

The tragedy has put a spotlight on the tense relations between Iran and the United States, which escalated in early January after the U.S. killed Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. The international community has been waiting for an independent investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization, but the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the process.

The international community must demand accountability and transparency in this investigation, and it's clear that Iran must take responsibility for its actions. Shooting down a civilian passenger plane, regardless of who was responsible for firing the missile, is an egregious violation of international law and a crime against humanity.

As tensions between Iran and the U.S. continue to simmer, it's essential we remember the loss of innocent lives in this tragedy. The families and loved ones of those who perished in the crash deserve closure, and the world needs to know who was ultimately to blame and what steps will be taken to ensure this never happens again.

Until the investigation is complete and all parties take full responsibility, the world will be left with unanswered questions and unresolved tension. However, it's essential that the international community does not forget the lives lost and that justice is served for the victims of Flight PS752.
