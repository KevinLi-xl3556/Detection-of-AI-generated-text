On Sunday, September 8th, a tragedy occurred in a popular Italian tourist town of Luttach. A car plowed into a group of German tourists who were walking down the road, killing six and injuring eleven others. According to the local authorities, the driver, a 28-year-old man from the neighboring town, was under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

The incident happened around 1:15 a.m. as the group of tourists was walking back to their hotel after an evening of celebrating. The driver, who was reportedly driving at a high speed, lost control of his car and veered onto the sidewalk, hitting the pedestrians. The impact was so severe that some of the victims were thrown over a wall and down a steep slope.

The emergency services were immediately called to the scene, and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. However, six of the victims, all Germans and between the ages of 20 and 25, lost their lives in the accident.

The authorities have arrested the driver, who sustained minor injuries in the crash. He faces charges of reckless driving and manslaughter. The incident has sent shockwaves throughout the local community and the world.

In response to the tragedy, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and called for better road safety measures. He said, "Such terrible news from Italy. Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. To prevent such tragedies in the future, it is important that all road users pay attention and drive responsibly."

This incident is yet another reminder of the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It serves as a warning to everyone to take extra caution on the road and never to drink and drive.

Our hearts go out to the families and friends of the victims of this horrific accident. May they find comfort and strength during this difficult time.
