As the NFL regular season comes to a close, fans are eagerly anticipating the upcoming wild-card round. With the playoffs on the line, the stakes are higher than ever before. This yearâ€™s wild-card round is set to be particularly exciting, with some of the league's top teams facing off against each other in a bid to secure a place in the divisional round.

The New York Times has compiled a list of predictions for the upcoming wild-card round, based on the performances of each team throughout the regular season. Let's take a look at the matchups and who is favored to come out on top.

The first matchup sees the Buffalo Bills take on the Indianapolis Colts. The Bills have been on fire this season, with quarterback Josh Allen leading an explosive offense. The Colts, on the other hand, have been inconsistent, with their defense carrying much of the load. Despite their struggles, the Colts have the talent to pull off an upset. However, The New York Times predicts that the Bills will come out on top, with Allen and his powerful offense proving too much for the Colts to handle.

In another exciting matchup, the Seattle Seahawks take on the Los Angeles Rams. These two teams met just a few weeks ago, with the Seahawks edging out a victory. This game will be another close one, with two strong defenses going head to head. The Seahawks' Russell Wilson is one of the league's top quarterbacks, but the Rams' defense is one of the best in the league. The New York Times gives a slight edge to the Seahawks in this one, but it's sure to be a hard-fought battle.

The third game features the Tampa Bay Buccaneers against the Washington Football Team. Many people are expecting a dominant performance from Tom Brady and the Buccaneers, but Washington's defense has been creating turnovers all season long. With Alex Smith back at quarterback, Washington has a chance to pull off an upset. However, The New York Times predicts that Brady will bring his postseason experience to the table and lead the Buccaneers to a victory in this one.

The final matchup features the Tennessee Titans against the Baltimore Ravens. These two teams have very different styles of play, with Baltimore relying heavily on its running game and Tennessee relying on its passing attack. The Ravens have struggled to find consistency this season, but the Titans also have some weaknesses on defense that could be exploited. In the end, The New York Times predicts that Lamar Jackson and the Ravens will come out on top, with their physical play and bruising running game proving too much for the Titans to handle.

In a year full of uncertainty, the NFL playoffs promise to bring some much-needed excitement and entertainment. With these talented teams facing off in the wild-card round, it's anyone's guess who will make it to the divisional round. Regardless of the outcome, football fans can expect an exciting week of games as the NFL playoffs get underway.
