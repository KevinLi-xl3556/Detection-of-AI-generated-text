‘The Sonata’ Review: A Little Fright Music

If you’re in the mood for some spine-tingling music and a good scare, ‘The Sonata’ is not to be missed. This indie horror film, directed by Andrew Desmond and co-written by Desmond and Arthur Morin, is an atmospheric thriller that takes you on a journey into a world of classical music, dark secrets and supernatural mystery.

The film revolves around Rose (Freya Tingley), a young and talented violinist who inherits a mansion from her estranged father, a famous composer who died many years ago. As Rose begins to explore the old and mysterious house and its dusty archives, she stumbles upon a hidden chamber in the basement where she finds an unfinished sonata written by her father. This discovery uncovers a web of family secrets, including the real reason why her father died.

As Rose delves deeper into the music and the strange history of her family, she begins to experience a series of supernatural occurrences that hint at a sinister force at work. She is aided in her quest by a journalist (Rutger Hauer) who is investigating the dark side of her father’s fame and a young and curious pianist (Simon Abkarian) who helps her decode the music and unlock the secrets of the past.

Tingley’s performance as the intrepid and haunted Rose is captivating, and Hauer brings his usual gravitas to the role of the jaded journalist. The real standout, however, is Abkarian, whose understated and mysterious pianist gives the film its dramatic core. The film’s pace is slow and deliberate, building up a sense of unease and suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Desmond’s direction is confident and assured, with a keen eye for detail and an appreciation of the power of music to convey emotion and create atmosphere. The film is shot in muted tones, with a moody and textured visual style that creates a sense of foreboding and tension. The sound design is also superb, with a haunting score by Alexis Maingaud and masterful use of silence and ambient noise to ratchet up the tension.

‘The Sonata’ is a film that rewards patience and attention, as it slowly unwinds its tale of family secrets, artistic obsession and supernatural menace. It is a genuinely creepy and atmospheric horror movie that is sure to appeal to fans of the genre, as well as anyone who appreciates good storytelling, strong performances and haunting music.
