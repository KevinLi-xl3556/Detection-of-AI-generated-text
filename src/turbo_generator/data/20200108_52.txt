As the 93rd Academy Awards season comes to a close, there is no denying that it has been one of the wildest weeks in Oscar history. With delayed ceremonies, virtual events, and a highly competitive field, it's no surprise that this year's awards have left people talking. However, amidst all the excitement, there is a troubling takeaway that cannot be overlooked.

For years, the Academy Awards have been criticized for its lack of diversity in both nominees and winners. While this year saw a significant increase in representation, with a record-breaking number of nominations for people of color, there is still much work to be done. In fact, the issue of diversity was brought to the forefront in a very public way during this year's ceremony.

During the highly anticipated Best Actor category, the award was given to Anthony Hopkins for his role in "The Father." This win came as a shock to many, as the clear frontrunner was the late Chadwick Boseman for his role in "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom." Boseman's death last year added to the emotional weight of his performance, and many believed that his win would be a fitting tribute to his legacy.

However, it wasn't just the upset win that left people feeling uneasy. The real issue was the way in which the award was presented. With Boseman's wife and family in attendance, it was widely expected that the show would end with a moving tribute to the actor. Instead, the show ended abruptly with no acknowledgement of Boseman's passing, leaving many viewers feeling disappointed and questioning the motives behind the decision.

The takeaway from this year's Oscar season is clear - diversity and inclusion need to be at the forefront of every aspect of the film industry. It's not enough to simply nominate people of color or pay lip service to the idea of representation. There needs to be a concerted effort to ensure that everyone has a seat at the table and that their voices are heard.

The film industry has the power to shape culture and influence how we see ourselves and the world around us. It's time for the industry to step up and take responsibility for the messages that they are sending. The Academy Awards should serve as a beacon of excellence, but it cannot do so if it continues to prioritize politics over artistry.

As we move forward, let us not forget the lessons learned from this year's ceremony. Let us work towards a more inclusive and representative future, where everyone has the opportunity to shine. Only then can we truly celebrate the art of cinema and the diverse voices that make it great.
