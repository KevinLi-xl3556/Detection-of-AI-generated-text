As cities around the world try to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, more and more have started to promote bicycling as a safe and sustainable mode of transportation for people of all ages. However, it seems that no other city has managed to embrace the bicycle culture as fully as Houten, a small town in the Netherlands.

As reported recently in The New York Times, Houten is a city that cycles with everyone - from schoolchildren to grandparents, full-time workers to retirees, and even the deceased. In Houten, bicycles are more than just a means of transportation; they are a way of life.

The city's roads and infrastructure are designed exclusively for bicycles and pedestrians, with cars only allowed in certain areas. Bike lanes are separated from vehicle lanes, and roundabouts are designed in such a way that they prioritize cyclists’ safety.

The result is a city where people of all ages and abilities can easily and safely cycle to work, school, the grocery store, or even the cemetery. The city's cycle paths are so well-connected that you can take a bike from one end of town to the other without ever having to cross a busy road.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Houten’s cycling culture is that it's not just for the young and the fit. Elderly residents, some in their 90s, cycle to appointments and social engagements. Parents cycle with their children to school or daycare - often with a cargo bike that can carry several kids at once.

Bikes are also used for more somber occasions. Funeral processions in Houten typically include a hearse followed by a procession of mourners on bikes, all riding slowly through the town's quiet streets.

The success of Houten’s cycling culture shows that it is possible to create a more sustainable and healthy city, where cars are not the sole mode of transportation. The city's approach to cycling is grounded in the understanding that everyone - not just the young, fit, and able-bodied - should have access to safe and reliable transportation options.

For other cities looking to follow in Houten's footsteps, it's important to remember that building a bike-friendly infrastructure is just the first step. Cities must also create a culture that values and prioritizes cycling as a mode of transportation. This means promoting cycling as a safe and enjoyable activity for people of all ages, offering education and training programs to help people feel confident on their bikes, and creating policies that prioritize cycling and pedestrian safety.

Houten’s cycling culture may be unique, but its lessons are universal. As cities around the world struggle to create sustainable and healthy urban environments, Houten serves as a powerful reminder of the benefits of a bike-friendly city.
