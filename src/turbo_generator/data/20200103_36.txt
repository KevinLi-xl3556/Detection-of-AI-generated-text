Following the recent U.S. airstrike on Iranian General Qassem Suleimani, Congressional leaders are calling for more details about the decision and the potential implications for U.S. national security. The New York Times reports that both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concern about the lack of transparency and consultation with Congress before carrying out the attack.

Many lawmakers are questioning the legality of the strike and the authority under which it was carried out, with some arguing that it could lead to further instability in the region and potentially draw the U.S. into another costly conflict. Some have also raised concerns about the potential for Iranian retaliation and the safety of American military personnel and diplomats stationed in the Middle East.

In response to these concerns, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that Congress will soon introduce a war powers resolution to limit the President's ability to engage in military action against Iran without first obtaining Congressional approval. Pelosi stated that "The administration must work with the Congress to advance an immediate, effective de-escalatory strategy that prevents further violence," adding that "America and the world cannot afford war."

Meanwhile, Republicans have largely defended the President's decision to take out Suleimani, arguing that he posed a significant threat to U.S. interests and that the strike served to deter further Iranian aggression. Some have also criticized Democrats for being too quick to condemn the attack and for seeking to limit the President's ability to defend the country.

It remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the coming days and weeks, and what the ultimate consequences of the strike will be. However, what is clear is that there are deep divisions within Congress on this issue, and that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will be closely scrutinizing the Trump administration's actions in the coming days in order to protect U.S. national security interests.
