Former President Donald Trump has continually peddled the idea that winning means everything. This is a rather bizarre and concerning concept to hold, especially when it comes to the well-being and safety of millions of American citizens. 

Trump's obsession with winning at all costs was evident even during his presidency, where he would make shocking decisions that would benefit him solely on a political level rather than have any beneficial impact on the country's people. As a result, his actions often yielded disastrous consequences for those who trusted and believed in him. 

The recent impeachment trial saw Trump's bizarre view of winning come to light once again. Despite being impeached twice and being responsible for the deadly January 6th insurrection, Trump continued to protect his ego and refused to take accountability for his actions. Instead, he rejoiced in the fact that he was acquitted, convinced that this marked a win for him. 

This outlook on winning has dangerous consequences that reach far beyond Trump's own personal beliefs. For someone who held the highest office in the land, it is deeply concerning to know that he places his own interests above everything else. When the leader of a country is more focused on winning than actually making a positive difference in people's lives, the very fabric that holds the country together begins to unravel. 

A prime example of this can be seen in Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the outbreak, he downplayed the severity of the virus and refused to take action, insisting that everything was "under control." As a result, when the pandemic finally hit, the United States was ill-prepared to deal with the crisis, and thousands of American lives were lost. All because Trump was more worried about winning than protecting his citizens. 

In conclusion, it is clear that Donald Trump's idea of winning is not in line with what is best for the country. Rather than focus on what truly matters and making a positive impact, Trump's obsession with winning is tearing the country apart. It's time for both politicians and citizens alike to realize that true victory lies not in personal victories but in what can benefit the greater good.
