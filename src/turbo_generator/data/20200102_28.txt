On Thursday, the New York Yankees’ pitcher, Domingo German, was suspended for the first 81 games of the 2020 season due to a violation of Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy. German’s suspension will take effect immediately and extend through the playoffs if the Yankees make it that far.

This comes as a shameful revelation for the Yankees, as the team has been among the strongest supporters for the league’s push to tackle domestic violence in recent years. The Yankees have worked closely with local organizations to raise awareness and provide resources for abuse victims, demonstrating their commitment to this impactful cause. However, with the suspension of their pitcher, the situation has become a stark reminder that no organization is immune to these heinous acts.

The exact details surrounding German’s case have not been publicly disclosed, but MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred released a statement that called the suspension "appropriate," given the severity of the alleged misconduct.

This is the latest bold statement from the league regarding domestic violence handling. In recent years, MLB has implemented a policy that mandates counseling and treatment for players accused of domestic violence, as well as an automatic investigation when domestic violence allegations are made, even those that fall outside the jurisdiction of law enforcement. All of these measures were introduced in an effort to protect victims and hold players accountable for their actions. 

Nonetheless, advocates for abuse survivors have long called for stronger punishments and a more comprehensive approach to tackling domestic violence in sports. While the league's policy has helped to raise awareness and highlight the issue, it’s clear that more can, and must, be done to address domestic violence in baseball.

The league’s response to the matter has been swift and transparent. The New York Yankees have also released a statement supporting the suspension and stating that they fully endorse MLB’s domestic violence policy.

Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects millions globally-both men and women alike- and the entire sports industry has a responsibility to hold its players accountable for inappropriate and harmful actions. MLB's decision to suspend Domingo German for 81 games demonstrates their continued commitment to the cause and sends a strong message that such behavior will not be tolerated.

As fans and advocates, our focus should be on providing support to survivors of domestic violence instead of glorifying the careers of abusive players. This suspension should serve as a wake-up call, and we should all strive to promote a culture where domestic violence is simply unacceptable- both on and off the field.
