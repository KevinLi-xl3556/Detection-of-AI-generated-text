Koala Mittens and Baby Bottles: Saving Australia's Animals After Fires - The New York Times

The recent devastating wildfires in Australia have killed an estimated billion animals, leaving many injured and homeless. However, thanks to the incredible efforts of animal welfare groups and volunteers, many are being saved and cared for.

One innovative way that rehabilitation centers are treating injured koalas is by using custom-made mittens. These mittens, often made by volunteers and knitted from cotton or wool, help to protect the animals' burnt paws and claws as they crawl through the trees searching for food.

The mittens, which have been affectionately dubbed “koala mittens,” were first created in 2019 by the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Since then, they have become increasingly popular, with many centers across Australia requesting them for their patients.

In addition to the mittens, volunteers and wildlife experts have been delivering thousands of baby bottles to organizations handling the feeding and care of orphaned animals. These bottles are crucial for the survival of baby animals, as they provide the necessary nutrition and care that they would normally receive from their mothers.

The efforts of volunteers and animal welfare organizations to help save animals from the wildfires have been remarkable. These groups are working tirelessly to ensure that even the most helpless of creatures are not forgotten in the aftermath of the disaster.

However, the fight to save Australia’s wildlife is far from over. More volunteers are needed, as are donations of both money and supplies. With the continued support of people around the world, we can help ensure that these animals receive the care and shelter that they so desperately need. 

In conclusion, the mittens and baby bottles are just two of the many ways that animal welfare groups and volunteers are coming together to save the lives of animals affected by the bushfires. As we look towards the future, it is critical that we continue to support these efforts to help Australia’s unique wildlife recover and thrive once again.
