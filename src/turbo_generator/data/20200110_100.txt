Roast chicken is a classic dish that never goes out of style, and as much as we love it, there's always room for improvement. Enter the new technique for making a roast chicken with even more crispy bits. The New York Times has shared their recipe and it's a game-changer.

The secret to this new method is to salt the chicken a day in advance, which draws out excess moisture and results in a perfectly crisp skin. Additionally, the bird is roasted at a high temperature for the first 20 minutes to further enhance its crispy texture.

But what really sets this roast chicken apart is the use of a cast-iron skillet. Not only does it create a beautiful sear on the bottom of the chicken, but it also collects the delicious juices for a flavorful pan sauce.

To make the pan sauce, simply deglaze the skillet with white wine and chicken broth, add some butter and herbs, and let it reduce until it thickens. Pour it over the chicken for a finishing touch that takes this classic dish to the next level.

Aside from the technique, the recipe itself is relatively simple with just a few ingredients - salt, thyme, rosemary, garlic, and of course, a whole chicken. It's a foolproof way to impress dinner guests or treat yourself to a delicious and satisfying meal.

So the next time you're craving roast chicken, give this new technique a try. You won't be disappointed in the extra crispy bits and flavorful pan sauce that take this classic dish to new heights.
