When one thinks of fast food giant McDonald’s, what comes to mind might be burgers, fries, and the iconic golden arches. However, what many people may not know is that McDonald’s played a significant role in the civil rights movement in the United States.

In the 1960s, McDonald’s was expanding rapidly, and its leadership saw an opportunity to tap into an untapped market: African Americans. However, at the time, many restaurants in the South and other parts of the country practiced segregation, refusing to serve Black people in their establishments. McDonald’s, on the other hand, made a bold decision to become one of the first fast-food chains to integrate its restaurants.

In 1963, McDonald’s hired Herb Washington, an African American track star, to own and operate a franchise in the predominantly Black neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. This was a significant move, as it not only ensured that Black people could access fast food in their own communities but it also provided entrepreneurial opportunities for African Americans who were previously shut out of traditional business ownership.

McDonald’s also became a pioneer in hiring African American employees. In 1968, James R. Funner Jr. was named the first Black vice president of the company. Later that year, the company also launched a series of commercials featuring Black people, showcasing the diversity of its workforce.

Furthermore, McDonald’s supported the civil rights movement through financial contributions. The company donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which provided legal representation to civil rights activists and played a crucial role in landmark court cases such as Brown v. Board of Education.

However, McDonald’s was not immune to criticism from civil rights activists. In 1968, the Black Panther Party called for a boycott of McDonald’s, claiming that the company discriminated against Black franchise owners and workers. The boycott was ultimately unsuccessful, but it sparked important conversations about race and business ownership.

Today, McDonald’s continues its legacy of diversity and inclusion in its workforce and business practices. In 2020, the company pledged $500,000 to the National Urban League, a civil rights organization that advocates for economic empowerment and social justice for African Americans.

The surprising history of McDonald’s and the civil rights movement highlights the importance of businesses using their power and influence to effect positive change in society. By breaking down barriers and promoting diversity and inclusion, McDonald’s paved the way for other businesses to follow suit and created opportunities for marginalized communities.
