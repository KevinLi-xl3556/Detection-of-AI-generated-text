In a shocking turn of events, the entire leadership of the Romance Writers of America (RWA) has announced their resignation. This follows a series of controversies that have rocked the organization, leaving many members feeling disillusioned and betrayed.

The RWA is a professional organization for writers of romance novels, with a mission to support and promote the genre. However, in recent months, it has been embroiled in a scandal involving allegations of racism and discrimination.

The controversy began in late 2019, when a book by author Courtney Milan criticized a fellow writer's novel for its portrayal of characters of color. The RWA then suspended Milan, claiming she had violated the organization's code of ethics. This sparked a backlash from many members, who felt that the RWA's actions were unjust and racially motivated.

The situation only worsened when it was revealed that the RWA's board of directors had been involved in a secret ethics investigation into Milan's criticism, without informing her of the allegations or providing her with a chance to defend herself. This led to widespread outrage and calls for reform within the organization.

In light of these events, the RWA's entire leadership team, including President Damon Suede, announced their resignations. In a statement, they cited the need for "a change of leadership" and expressed regret over "the pain and trauma" caused by recent events.

Many members of the RWA have welcomed the resignations, seeing them as a necessary step towards addressing the organization's longstanding issues with diversity and inclusivity. Some have called for a complete overhaul of the RWA's structure and governance.

The fallout from this controversy is likely to have a significant impact on the world of romance writing. The RWA has been a powerful force in the industry for decades, providing networking opportunities and resources for writers. Its collapse could create a void that will have to be filled by new organizations or coalitions.

Despite this uncertainty, however, the future of the romance genre remains bright. Romance novels continue to be wildly popular, with millions of readers around the world. As writers and readers alike work to create a more inclusive and supportive community, the genre is sure to thrive for years to come.
