Inherit the Viper, a chilling crime drama set in the deep underbelly of a struggling American town, is a gripping and poignant portrayal of familial bonds threatened by the lure of quick cash.

Set in the poverty-stricken town of West Virginia, the movie depicts the lives of three siblings - Kip, Josie, and Boots - who run a pill mill and sell opioids to the locals. With wages at a low and employment a scarcity, it's the ideal situation for the siblings to establish a thriving business, but it's also against the law.

Inherit the Viper is slickly directed by Anthony Jerjen who expertly captures the milieu of the town, complete with all its bleakness, and the moral dilemmas that come with the characters' choices. The film's cinematography and editing are fascinating, aptly capturing the suffocating atmosphere.

Josh Hartnett, Owen Teague, and Margarita Levieva play the three siblings in question, with Hartnett shouldering the majority of the film's weight as the elder Kip, determined to keep his family afloat with whatever means necessary. Teague is excellent as Josie, a young man who grows tired of the seedy business and wants out before it's too late. And Levieva is pitch-perfect as Boots, the sister who lusts for the good life and couldn't care less about the mess left behind.

Indie darling Bruce Dern plays a belligerent man who offers up a possible buyer for the siblings' illicit stock, while "The Walking Dead's" Chandler Riggs turns in a steady performance as a small-time drug dealer who gets in over his head.

Inherit the Viper is not just a story about an illegal drug trade or a cautionary tale about the hazards of addiction. Jerjen does a wonderful job of delving into the moral decay of people who feel they have no other choice, even if that means putting the lives of their loved ones at risk.

The film's closing scene is a bleak and haunting one, leaving viewers to ponder the implications of the path the siblings choose to take. Inherit the Viper is a challenging watch, one that leaves a lasting impact and highlights the gravity of difficult decisions.
