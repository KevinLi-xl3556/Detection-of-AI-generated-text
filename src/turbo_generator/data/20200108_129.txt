As children, we were often taught to treat others with kindness and respect. We were told that kindness was the key to building friendships and resolving conflicts. However, as we grow older and face more complex situations, we begin to realize that kindness does not always lead to positive outcomes. In fact, sometimes kindness can do more harm than good.

A recent article in The New York Times explores this idea. The author argues that sometimes, when dealing with difficult people, rather than trying to kill them with kindness, it may be more effective to do just the opposite. This may seem counterintuitive, but the author makes a compelling case.

The article describes a situation where an employee is being harassed by their boss. The employee tries to diffuse the situation by being kind and accommodating, hoping that this will lead to a better working relationship. However, the author argues that in situations like this, kindness can be interpreted as weakness, and the harasser may continue to push boundaries.

Instead, the author suggests that the employee should set clear boundaries and express their dissatisfaction with the situation. This can be done in a calm and assertive manner, without resorting to rudeness or aggression. By doing so, the employee sends a clear message that they will not tolerate harassment or mistreatment.

This approach may not work in every situation, but it highlights the importance of being assertive and standing up for oneself. Sometimes, being too kind or accommodating can lead to being taken advantage of or being seen as a pushover. By setting clear boundaries and expressing dissatisfaction when necessary, we can command respect and build healthier relationships.

Of course, this does not mean that we should abandon kindness altogether. Kindness is still an important trait, and it can have many positive effects on our lives and relationships. However, it is important to recognize that there are situations where kindness is not enough. By being assertive when necessary, we can find a balance between being kind and standing up for ourselves.

In conclusion, the idea that we should always kill people with kindness may not be effective in every situation. Sometimes, we need to do just the opposite and stand up for ourselves. This does not mean that we should abandon kindness altogether, but rather that we should recognize its limitations and be willing to be assertive when necessary. By finding this balance, we can build healthier relationships and command respect from those around us.
