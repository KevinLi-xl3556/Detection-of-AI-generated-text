Iraq has found itself trapped yet again in a rivalry between the United States and Iran, as tensions between the two nations escalated in recent weeks. The latest round of hostilities began with the killing of Iranian Major General Qassim Suleimani in a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad International Airport, followed by a retaliatory strike by Iran on two U.S. military bases in Iraq, which led to Iraq's retaliatory missile attacks on American bases, raising fears of a full-blown war between the two enemies.

Amidst all this, Iraq, one of the world's most war-torn countries, has been trying to find its footing. Iraq has found itself once again caught between a rock and a hard place, with the situation in the region fraught with unpredictability, political tensions, violence and instability. The country, which has already been reeling from a long-drawn-out war against ISIS in which an estimated 18,000 civilians died, now has to face the risk of being plunged into yet another conflict.

For Iraq, neutrality in this conflict is an elusive goal. Despite Iraq's stated policy of non-alignment, it has been a regional ally of Iran, with powerful Iran-backed militias playing an important role in Iraqi politics and security. At the same time, Iraq also has a strategic partnership with the United States, which has invested heavily in Iraq's security and stabilization.

The U.S. drone strike that killed General Suleimani has put Iraq in an especially difficult position. The attack happened on Iraqi soil, without the knowledge or consent of the Iraqi government, and has sparked widespread anger and protests across the country. For many Iraqis, this is seen as a blatant violation of their country's sovereignty and a trigger for further instability.

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has taken a cautious approach, urging both the United States and Iran to show restraint and respect Iraqi sovereignty. But he has also requested that the U.S. withdraw its troops from Iraq, a move that has been seen as an attempt to ease tensions with Iran. The U.S. has so far ignored the demand, indicating that it intends to maintain a military presence in Iraq.

The situation in Iraq remains precarious. The country is grappling with a weak economy, political unrest, and sectarian divisions. The protests that started in October 2019, fueled by corruption and high levels of unemployment, pose a significant challenge to the government. Now, with the crisis between the United States and Iran, Iraq's fragility has become even more evident.

The international community has called on all sides to show restraint and to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis. The United Nations has also offered to mediate between the United States and Iran. But, given the history of conflict in the region and the current political climate, finding a diplomatic solution that satisfies everyone will be a daunting task.

In conclusion, Iraq's precarious situation is yet another example of how tensions between two powerful nations can have serious implications for other countries in the region. It is important for all parties to exercise restraint and to respect the sovereignty of Iraq if the country is to avoid further violence and insecurity. The world must come together to support Iraq in its efforts to rebuild, stabilize and progress towards a peaceful future.
