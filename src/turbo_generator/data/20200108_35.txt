In the wake of a tragic mass shooting, it's become common to hear people say, "It's not the gun, it's the person holding the gun." This sentiment is often used to push back against calls for gun control legislation. But when it comes to mental illness, the opposite sentiment prevails: "It's not the person, it's the illness."

This is a dangerous oversimplification. Mental illness is complex and multifaceted. To blame a mass shooting on mental illness is to both stigmatize those who struggle with mental health and to ignore the systemic issues that contribute to mass violence.

First, let's talk about stigma. There is a pervasive and damaging stereotype that people with mental illness are inherently violent. This stereotype is largely unfounded. Studies have shown that people with mental illness are no more likely to commit violent acts than people without mental illness. In fact, people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.

The idea that mental illness causes violence is rooted in fear and ignorance. It's much easier to blame an abstract concept like mental illness than to grapple with the uncomfortable truth that anyone - regardless of mental health status - can commit a violent act.

But beyond stigma, blaming mental illness for mass violence is a distraction from the real issues at play. Mass shootings are not caused by mental illness alone. They are the result of a confluence of factors, including access to firearms, toxic masculinity, and white supremacy.

Blaming mental illness allows us to avoid confronting these systemic issues. It allows us to ignore the fact that the United States has more guns per capita than any other country in the world, and that this contributes to our staggering rate of gun violence. It allows us to ignore the fact that many mass shooters espouse racist and misogynistic beliefs that go unchallenged in our society.

Finally, it's important to remember that the vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent. In fact, people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. By blaming mental illness for mass shootings, we are unfairly vilifying a vulnerable population.

Instead of looking for easy scapegoats, we need to address the root causes of mass violence in our country. This means acknowledging the role of guns, toxic masculinity, and white supremacy. It means investing in mental health services and fighting against stigma. It means having difficult conversations about what we value as a society and how we can work to create a safer, more equitable world.

So let's stop blaming mental illness for mass shootings. It's not only untrue, it's also harmful. Instead, let's work to address the underlying issues that lead to mass violence in our country.
