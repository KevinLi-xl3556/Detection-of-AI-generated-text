As the minimum wage increases in certain states and cities across the United States, a group of workers is being left behind: those who work for tips.

Under federal law, tipped workers are paid a base rate of $2.13 an hour, with the expectation that tips will make up the difference to reach the minimum wage. However, the reality is that many tipped workers struggle to make ends meet, especially in areas with high costs of living.

While some states have increased the tipped minimum wage along with the regular minimum wage, others have not. In fact, in some states, the tipped minimum wage has not changed in decades. For example, in Alabama and Louisiana, tipped workers still earn the federal rate of $2.13 an hour, which has not been raised since 1991.

This leaves tipped workers in a precarious position, as they must rely on the generosity of customers to make a living wage. And when customers don't tip or don't tip enough, the burden falls entirely on the worker.

This issue disproportionately affects women and people of color, who make up a majority of tipped workers. According to the National Employment Law Project, women account for over two-thirds of all tipped workers, and people of color are overrepresented in the industry.

Furthermore, the tipped minimum wage system has been shown to contribute to a culture of sexual harassment in the workplace. Tipped workers who rely on tips for their livelihood may feel pressured to tolerate inappropriate behavior from customers or coworkers in order to maintain their income.

There is a movement to address this issue and eliminate the tipped minimum wage altogether. Some states, such as California and Oregon, have already done so. In these states, tipped workers earn the same minimum wage as other workers, without relying on tips to make up the difference.

Eliminating the tipped minimum wage would ensure that all workers are paid a fair wage for the work they do, without having to rely on the whims of customers. It would also help to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment in the industry.

With the minimum wage on the rise in many parts of the country, it's time for policymakers to take a closer look at the tipped minimum wage and ensure that all workers are included in the push for fair wages.
