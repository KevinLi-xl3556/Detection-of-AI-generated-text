Opinion | Harry and Meghan, Going Their Own Way

As the buzz surrounding Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to step back as senior members of the British royal family fades away, it’s worth taking a closer look at what their move represents beyond mere celebrity drama.

Some have interpreted the couple’s choice as a sign of rebellion or as a lack of commitment to what it means to be a royal. But casting their decision in this way misses the point. Harry and Meghan's choice wasn't a selfish or impulsive one, but rather an act of bravery and a statement about the dangers of blind obedience to tradition.

Firstly, it’s important to recognize the pressure that comes with being a royal. Interviews with Harry and Meghan have made clear the intense scrutiny and unforgiving media attention the couple has faced. This scrutiny would only increase if they remained as full-time members of the royal family. After all, the paparazzi didn’t exactly have a great track record when it came to Harry’s mother's safety.

Secondly, there’s the issue of inherited privilege. Harry and Meghan are symbols of a monarchy that is, in many ways, a symbol of anachronistic privilege. To be born into this system is to be given wealth, power, and opportunities that most can only dream of. But at the same time, it comes with expectations and limitations, including social mores, political limitations, and a public commitment to the historical evidence of the crown that offers this lifestyle.

Harry and Meghan choosing to step back from this life offers a powerful statement about the possibilities of intentional living outside systems of inherited power and privilege.

The move also offers some commentary on the merits of a chosen family over a biological one. Throughout British history, the royal family has prioritized bloodlines above all else. Think of the “keep it in the family” mentality that has led to consanguineous marriages throughout the monarchs’ reign. Perhaps Harry and Meghan’s choice to create a chosen family instead of remaining in a toxic place kept captive by their position is not only admirable but might aid in advancing cultural and social change towards a more inclusive and diverse British monarchy.

As for the haters who've labeled them as unhappy or selfish? They're mistaken. It takes a particular type of courage to go against the expectations of tradition, particularly when those expectations have been held up for centuries, and those who have dared to break them have often seen their lives destroyed. Recognizing that the priority isn’t maintaining his royal status quo but making choices that support his love and his family is a brave choice, and we should respect it as such.

Harry and Meghan’s decision to step back from their senior roles is a powerful indication of the individual's capacity to determine their own futures. Sure, their decision concerns a royal family, but it speaks to a broader, fundamental question of what it means to be free - especially within systems that create limitations on it.
