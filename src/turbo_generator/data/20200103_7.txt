The New York Times

As the week comes to a close, let's take a look at some of the biggest news stories that have been making headlines today. In this Friday evening briefing, we'll cover the latest developments in Iraq, the Methodist Church's decision on same-sex marriage, and some exciting news from Hollywood's biggest night, the Oscars.

The situation in Iraq continues to be tense after a series of attacks earlier this week left several people dead and dozens injured. On Friday, the top US general in Iraq, John P. Roth, warned that the country could be facing a new wave of violence and instability, as anti-government protests and political tensions escalate. Roth's comments came as the Iraqi authorities intensified their crackdown on protestors, using tear gas and live ammunition to disperse crowds in several cities.

In other news, the United Methodist Church announced on Friday that it is splitting over the issue of same-sex marriage. The church, one of the largest Protestant denominations in the world, has been grappling with the issue for years, with some members supporting same-sex marriage while others opposing it. In a historic move, the church will now divide into two separate entities, with one supporting same-sex marriage and the other rejecting it.

Finally, the much-anticipated 93rd Academy Awards took place on Sunday, April 25th, with some surprising results. The South Korean film 'Parasite' made history by becoming the first-ever foreign language film to win the Best Picture award, while its director Bong Joon-ho won the Best Director award. Other notable winners included Joaquin Phoenix, who won Best Actor for his role in 'Joker', and Ren√©e Zellweger, who won Best Actress for her portrayal of Judy Garland in 'Judy'. The awards ceremony was a showcase of talent, creativity, and diversity, highlighting some of the best works in the film industry in the past year.

In conclusion, this Friday evening briefing covered some of the key news stories of the day, including the situation in Iraq, the United Methodist Church's decision on same-sex marriage, and the exciting results from the Oscars. While the world faces many challenges and uncertainties, it is heartening to see people overcoming obstacles and achieving great things in their respective fields.
