As we move farther away from World War II, it is becoming increasingly important to hear and preserve the stories of those who lived through it. This is especially true for the families of those who experienced the war firsthand. If you have living relatives who were there during the war, sharing their stories could help shed new light on the darkest period in human history.

The New York Times is currently seeking personal stories from people with living relatives who experienced World War II. Whether your relative served in the armed forces, lived in Europe during the war, or was a civilian in other parts of the world, we want to hear their story. With their permission, we will share their experiences with our readers.

Why are these stories so important? For starters, they help us understand history on a more personal level. We can read about the battles, the politics, and the strategy of the war in textbooks, but nothing compares to hearing the firsthand accounts of those who were there. Their experiences help us understand the human cost of war and the sacrifices that were made on all sides.

Additionally, these stories can help us contextualize current events. As we face new conflicts and challenges, it is important to learn from the past. By hearing the stories of those who lived through World War II, we can gain a better understanding of how people coped with fear, loss, and uncertainty during one of the most tumultuous periods in history.

If you have a living relative who experienced World War II, we encourage you to reach out to them and hear their story. Take notes, record their recollections, and ask them to share any old photographs or documents they may have. With their permission, you can then share their story with us.

At The New York Times, we are committed to honoring the stories of those who lived through World War II. We believe that by sharing these stories with our readers, we can help preserve the collective memory and ensure that the lessons of the past are never forgotten. Join us in this important work by sharing your family's story today.
