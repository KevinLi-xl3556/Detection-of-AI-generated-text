As we enter 2020, the world has already witnessed two major events that have had global ramifications: the Boeing 737 Max crash and the Iran missile attack. Both incidents have left a deep impact on the world, and it is essential to take stock of these events and examine their consequences.

The Boeing 737 Max crash, which took place in March 2019, was a tragic incident that claimed the lives of 346 people. Two separate 737 Max planes operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed just months apart, and investigations found a flaw in the plane's software as the primary cause. The crashes led to the grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet and brought the aviation industry's safety standards into question.

The initial response from Boeing was disappointing, with the company seeming to focus on protecting its profits and reputation rather than taking responsibility for the crash. However, Boeing eventually launched a series of initiatives to regain customers' trust, including changes to the design, improving pilot training, and implementing new safety features. Despite these efforts, the 737 Max remains grounded, and investigations into the crash continue.

The second significant event of the year was the missile attack by Iran on a U.S. military base in Iraq. The attack was in response to the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by the U.S. The missile attack was widely seen as a significant escalation in tensions between the two countries, with many concerned about the potential for a full-scale war.

Fortunately, the missile attack did not lead to any fatalities or significant damage to the military base. However, it did result in the deaths of 176 passengers and crew when a Ukrainian passenger plane was mistakenly shot down by the Iranian military. The international community condemned Iran's actions, and it led to protests within Iran calling for accountability and increased political openness.

The two incidents mentioned above demonstrate the fragility and unpredictability of our world. The Boeing crash and the Iran missile attack were both unforeseeable, yet their impact was significant. These events served as reminders of the importance of transparency and accountability in both the public and private sectors.

The aviation industry must continue to prioritize safety above profits and take concrete steps to ensure that incidents like the 737 Max crash never happen in the future. Similarly, the governments around the world must be held accountable for their actions and work towards resolving conflicts peacefully.

The year 2020 has just begun, and it is essential to learn from the events of the past and take steps to build a safer, more just world. In a world that is increasingly interconnected, we must remember that our actions and decisions have consequences that extend beyond our immediate surroundings.
