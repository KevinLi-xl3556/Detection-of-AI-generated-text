As we enter into a new decade, one common resolution that has been on everyone's mind is to drink more water. Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining optimal health and wellness, as it helps with digestion, circulation, maintaining body temperature and flushing out toxins. However, despite these many benefits, studies show that up to 75% of Americans still suffer from chronic dehydration.

Recent research suggests that dehydration can have a negative impact on mental and physical performance. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition showed that even mild dehydration can lead to reduced cognitive performance, mood swings and increased feelings of fatigue. Dehydration can lead to headaches, muscle cramps and even kidney stones in extreme cases.

Given these risks, it’s no wonder that more and more people are committing to drink more water this year. But how much water should you be drinking to stay hydrated and healthy? While the general rule of thumb is to drink eight glasses of water a day, the actual amount varies depending on several factors.

Factors like age, gender, weight, activity level, and climate can impact how much water we need to consume. For example, pregnant or nursing women may need more water to stay hydrated, and those living in hotter climates may need to drink more due to increased sweating. As such, it’s important to consult a doctor or dietitian to determine your individual needs to ensure that you are properly hydrated.

It’s important to note that drinking water doesn’t only mean drinking plain water. Other forms of fluids, like tea, coffee and juice, can contribute to your overall fluid intake. However, it’s important to avoid sugary drinks like sodas, as they can be dehydrating and can lead to weight gain, tooth decay and other health issues.

There are several ways to increase your daily water intake, like carrying a reusable water bottle with you at all times, setting reminders on your phone or making it a habit to drink a glass of water with every meal. Furthermore, adding vegetables like cucumber or fruits like strawberries to your water can make it more enticing to drink and add flavor without adding calories.

To sum it up, staying hydrated is a crucial component of a healthy lifestyle, and drinking more water is an excellent way to achieve this. As we enter into 2020, make a commitment to drinking more water, and take charge of your health and wellness.
