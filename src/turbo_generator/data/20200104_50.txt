In a world where terrorism has become a constant threat, governments and militaries around the globe are forced to make tough decisions in order to protect their citizens.  The United States has been engaged in a long war on terror since the September 11 attacks in 2001, and targeted killings have become a controversial yet necessary tactic in the fight against extremist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS.

One such controversial incident came to light in a recent article in The New York Times, which explored the decision-making process behind the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen who had risen in the ranks of Al Qaeda and was believed to be planning terrorist attacks against the US. Awlaki was targeted and killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011, along with another American citizen who was traveling with him.

The article delves into the debate within the Obama administration over whether to approve the strike, with some officials arguing that Awlaki should be captured and tried in a court of law, and others asserting that he posed an imminent threat and needed to be eliminated.

The decision ultimately fell to President Obama, who approved the strike on Awlaki. The article quotes him as saying, “This is an individual who had embraced Al Qaeda and its ideology, and who was actively planning to kill Americans. He was not a U.S. citizen who was caught up in a conflict overseas. He was actively planning operations to kill people.”

The killing of Awlaki raises important questions about the legality and morality of targeted killings, particularly when it comes to American citizens. The government insists that such operations are conducted in accordance with international law and are necessary to protect American lives. Critics argue that they are extrajudicial killings that violate the Constitution and international human rights laws.

The debate over targeted killings will continue, as will the threat of terrorism. As Americans, we must constantly grapple with the balance between security and freedom. Quoting President Obama again, “Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.” It is a difficult and complex struggle, but one that we must continue to fight with wisdom, courage, and moral clarity.
