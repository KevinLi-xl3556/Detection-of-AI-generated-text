How Rupert Murdoch Is Influencing Australiaâ€™s Bushfire Debate

Amid the ongoing catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged much of Australia, media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp empire have faced growing criticism for downplaying the severity of the crisis and promoting climate denialism. From his outlets' suggestions that arsonists are to blame for the blazes to their attacks on climate activists and government opponents, Murdoch's Australian media have been accused of pushing a harmful agenda that could undermine efforts to mitigate and address the impacts of the fires.

The New York Times recently published an investigation into Murdoch's role in shaping the discourse around the bushfires, highlighting how his media assets have been used to promote a pro-coal, anti-environmental narrative that aligns with his business interests and political views. Murdoch, a longtime supporter of conservative politicians and policies, has been a vocal opponent of climate action and renewable energy, arguing that they are expensive, unreliable, and not necessary to deal with the alleged natural variability of the planet's climate.

The article notes that Murdoch's influence over the Australian media landscape is significant, with his company owning about 60% of the country's newspapers, including major titles such as The Australian, The Daily Telegraph, and The Herald Sun. These papers have been accused of spreading falsehoods and distortions about the bushfires, such as claiming that green policies and regulations are preventing firefighters from doing their jobs effectively and that hazard reduction burns are a panacea for the crisis. Such claims have been challenged by experts and firefighters who argue that climate change, not fuel loads or land management, is the main driver of the fires, and that the recent cuts to firefighting budgets and staff have made the situation worse.

The New York Times investigation also reveals how some of Murdoch's journalists and editors have expressed their frustration with the pro-coal, anti-environment stance of their company, which they see as contradicting the facts and the public interest. For example, one senior executive reportedly said that she was prevented from publishing more stories about the links between the fires and climate change, while another editor lamented that the Murdoch papers had become "part of the propaganda machine" of the government and the fossil fuel industry.

The article concludes that Murdoch's agenda-setting role in Australian media is not only shaping the debate around the bushfires but also affecting the broader political and social landscape of the country. By promoting a vision of Australia that emphasizes resource extraction and economic growth over environmental sustainability and social justice, Murdoch's media assets may be contributing to a toxic and divisive culture that undermines democracy and progress. As one former editor of a News Corp paper said, "You can't have a debate about climate change in Australia without talking about Rupert Murdoch."
