As a female Gen Xer, I have spent many Sunday mornings pondering the deeper meaning of life while drinking a cup of coffee. However, as I have aged, my Sunday routine has shifted from existential questioning to managing the anxiety that permeates my daily life.

Waking up on a Sunday is always a mix of relief and dread. Relief that there is not much to do and dread that the impending work week is only a few hours away. The bedding feels cozy and warm, but the anxiety begins to bubble up as I think about all the tasks I need to complete.

First on the list is to tame the ever-growing list of emails that have accumulated over the weekend. As a career-driven individual, I feel a strong need to be always “on” and accessible. This pressure to consistently be in communication with colleagues and clients can feel suffocating, even on weekends.

After tackling the emails, it is time to make a plan for the upcoming week. Writing a to-do list helps me to organize my thoughts and approach the week with a clear head. Yet, this also adds to my anxiety, as my list is never-ending and the expectations for myself are astronomical.

To combat these feelings, I try to incorporate some form of self-care into my Sunday routine. This can range from taking a long bath, going for a walk outside, or simply reading a book for pleasure. While I know these activities won’t magically erase my anxiety, they do provide a much-needed mental break and allow me to slow down and reconnect with myself.

As the day progresses, I try to remind myself that it is important to balance productivity with rest. While it is imperative to get work done and stay on top of responsibilities, it is equally crucial to allow myself to recharge and rest. This recognition has become even more crucial as I recognize the impact that burnout can have on my mental and physical health.

Ultimately, my Sundays are not filled with grand adventures or luxurious relaxation. Instead, they are a balance of managing my anxiety and carving out time for self-care. As a Gen Xer, I am continuously confronting the challenges of the modern workplace and the ever-increasing demands of technology. But, through intentional self-care and a focus on balance, I can continue to navigate these challenges with grace and purpose.
