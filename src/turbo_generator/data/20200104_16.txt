The world is in a state of constant conflict, and in such an environment, the role of the president as commander-in-chief becomes ever more important. In the United States, however, the current president's approach to war-making has raised concerns, as he seeks expanded powers to make war.

President Donald Trump has asserted broad powers to conduct military operations around the globe without congressional approval, including ordering the assassination of foreign leaders and launching strikes against Iran. Critics argue that this approach places a heavy burden on the president's judgment and could lead to disastrous consequences.

The current administration's approach to war-making has broken from the traditional balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. Under the Constitution, only Congress has the power to declare war. Yet, recent presidents, including President Trump, have sought to expand their authority to make war without congressional approval, relying on existing authorizations for use of military force to justify strikes against foreign targets.

This approach has been met with widespread concern and condemnation from members of Congress, who argue that this kind of unilateral decision-making could lead to unintended consequences and lead the United States into another unnecessary war.

This expanded use of presidential powers is not only a shift from the traditional balance of power but also a move away from international norms. The use of targeted assassinations, drone strikes, and other military operations violate international law and raise serious ethical questions.

As the United States continues to grapple with international conflicts, it becomes especially important to scrutinize the president's power to make war. The role of Congress in war-making must be strengthened, and we must demand more accountability and oversight from our leaders.

In conclusion, the current era of perpetual conflict demands careful consideration of how we approach war-making. We must protect democratic norms and guard against the abuse of expanded presidential powers. Without a strong commitment to oversight and accountability, the United States risks descending into a perpetual state of war where decisions are made without democratic consent or consideration of the long-term costs.
