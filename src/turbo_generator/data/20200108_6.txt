A New York State investigation into a Christian health cost-sharing affiliate has raised questions about the legitimacy of these alternatives to traditional health insurance.

Christian health cost-sharing affiliates are organizations that pool the money of members with similar beliefs in order to share the cost of medical expenses. However, these organizations are not bound by the same regulations as traditional health insurance companies and are therefore not required to cover certain medical procedures or follow certain consumer protection laws.

The investigation in question is targeting two specific affiliates, Aliera Healthcare and Trinity HealthShare. The investigation alleges that these organizations misled consumers by implying that they were selling comprehensive health insurance when, in fact, they were selling limited products that didn’t meet state requirements.

Aliera and Trinity are being accused of numerous violations of New York insurance laws, including unlicensed insurance activity and deceptive marketing practices. The investigation is ongoing and could result in fines and legal action against the companies.

Christian health cost-sharing affiliates have become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative to traditional health insurance. These organizations often attract consumers with lower monthly payments and the promise of sharing medical expenses with like-minded individuals. However, critics argue that these organizations can leave consumers with large medical bills if their costs exceed what the pool can cover.

In addition to New York State’s investigation, several other states have expressed concerns about Christian health cost-sharing affiliated. The Kansas Insurance Department issued a warning in 2017 about the risks of these organizations, stating that “consumers should be aware that joining especially an unlicensed one, risks inadequate protection and/or significant financial losses.”

Despite the growing scrutiny, Christian health cost-sharing affiliates are continuing to expand. The industry is expected to grow by 60% over the next two years, according to industry data.

The investigation in New York State serves as a reminder that consumers need to do their due diligence when considering alternatives to traditional health insurance. While Christian health cost-sharing affiliates may seem attractive, they come with a unique set of risks and limitations. Before joining one of these organizations, consumers should thoroughly research the organization’s history and policies, understand the types of medical services they will and won’t cover, and consider the potential financial risks.
