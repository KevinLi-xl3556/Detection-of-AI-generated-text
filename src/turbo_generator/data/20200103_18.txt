The impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump has taken a turn for the uncertain, as the Senate remains deadlocked on how to proceed with the proceedings. The impasse deepened over the weekend, with both sides refusing to budge on the key issue of whether to call witnesses.

The trial was thrown into chaos on Saturday, as Democrats sought to call witnesses in order to bolster their case against Mr. Trump. Republicans, however, quickly pushed back against the move, arguing that such a move would drag the proceedings out indefinitely, and that it would be unfair to allow new evidence to be admitted at this late stage.

The situation has left the trial in doubt, and many are wondering what the next steps will be. Some are calling for a delay in the proceedings, while others are urging the Senate to move forward with a vote.

Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the impeachment process has once again highlighted the deep political divide in America. Many Americans remain deeply divided over Mr. Trump, with some viewing him as a savior of the country, while others see him as a grave threat to democracy.

As the trial continues to unfold, it is likely that the political rhetoric will only intensify, as both sides seek to drive their respective messages home. Ultimately, however, it will be up to the Senate to decide whether to convict Mr. Trump, and much rests on the outcome of the current stalemate.

For now, the world watches and waits, as the impeachment impasse deepens, leaving the future of Mr. Trump's trial in doubt.
