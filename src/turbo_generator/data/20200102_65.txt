Italian Vogue has made a bold move this month by breaking tradition and not publishing any photographs. This decision by the fashion magazine has sparked a conversation about the modeling industry and fashion media.

According to The New York Times, Italian Vogue received criticism in November 2020 after their online editorial debut featured only white models. In response to this backlash, the magazine's editor-in-chief, Emanuele Farneti, stated that the publication intended to use the following months to release editorials that would include more Black models, culture, and stories. Hence, the decision to not publish any photographs this month â€“ instead, the magazine has chosen to feature illustrations and graphic designs.

This move has been seen as a way to redirect focus onto other forms of creativity and artistic expression in fashion media instead of solely relying on models and photographs. "We are moving towards a monthly that will be made up of articles, reportage, criticism, fashion," Farneti explained in a statement to The Guardian.

Italian Vogue is not the first fashion magazine to shift its focus from photographs to illustrations. In the early 2000s, French Vogue briefly experimented with illustrations before returning to photography. However, the current industry climate, which places a great deal of emphasis on diversity and inclusion, may make this shift more permanent.

The representation of diverse models has been a hot topic in the modeling industry, with Black models pushing for more visibility and wider opportunities. The recent dialogue around Black Lives Matter has further amplified the conversation.

By replacing photography with graphic designs, Italian Vogue is not only shedding light on alternative forms of artistic expression, but it is also shifting the focus back to the clothing and the designs themselves. This move can also be seen as an opportunity to showcase the work of up-and-coming artists and illustrators who may have been overlooked in the past.

In conclusion, Italian Vogue's decision to not publish any photographs this month is a significant move that invites a new conversation about the modeling industry and the role of fashion media. It is a challenge to the industry to focus on inclusivity and diversity while exploring alternative forms of creative expression.
