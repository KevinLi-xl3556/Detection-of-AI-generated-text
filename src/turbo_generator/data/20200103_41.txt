The recent assassination of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani by US forces has prompted mixed reactions from different parts of the world. Israel, in particular, has lauded the move, but with caution.

In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Suleimani as a "terrorist mastermind" who was responsible for the deaths of countless innocent people in Israel and around the world.

Netanyahu also praised US President Donald Trump for ordering the strike, saying that it sent a message to Iran that actions have consequences.

However, Israeli officials also expressed concern about the potential for retaliation from Iran, which has vowed to exact "harsh revenge" on the US and its allies.

“Israel commends the United States for eliminating Qassem Soleimani,” Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a tweet. “Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense” he added.

Israel, in the past, has been a target of Iran-led terrorist attacks. The country has also been vocal about its opposition to Iran's nuclear program as it poses a threat to Israeli security.

The country has often found itself in the crosshairs of Iran, and the presence of Iranian-backed militias and Hezbollah on its borders has raised concerns about the possibility of an attack.

As a result, Israel has taken a cautious approach to the current situation, while continuing to express its support for the United States.

The Israeli military has reportedly increased its readiness in anticipation of a possible Iranian response to the killing of Suleimani.

Furthermore, Israeli security forces have been working closely with their US counterparts to monitor potential threats to Israeli targets around the world.

The assassination of Suleimani has sparked further instability in the already volatile Middle East region. Israel, as a key US ally in the region, will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on the situation as it unfolds.

In conclusion, Israel has lauded the assassination of Suleimani while being cautious about the potential for retaliation. As the situation in the Middle East remains uncertain, it is crucial that countries like Israel and the US take measures to protect their citizens and interests in the region.
