Woody Vasulka, a pioneer of video art, passed away on December 20, 2019, at the age of 82. His legacy extends far beyond the confines of the contemporary art world, as he was a key figure in the development of video as a medium. Through his innovative use of technology and experimentation, he pushed the limits of art in ways that were previously unimagined.

Born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1937, Vasulka first trained as a sculptor before turning his attention to video in the early 1970s. He quickly realized the potential of the medium to create immersive experiences that surpassed those of traditional art forms. Together with his wife Steina, Vasulka became one of the early proponents of artists working with electronic media, and in 1971 they established The Kitchen, a nonprofit organization in New York City that showcased video works and performances.

Throughout his career, Vasulka was driven by an insatiable curiosity and a commitment to exploring the possibilities of technology in art. In works such as The Brotherhood, which featured a complex system of cameras and monitors, he sought to create a new kind of visual language that would transcend traditional modes of expression. The result was a body of work that not only expanded the boundaries of art but also helped to redefine the way in which we understand and experience technology.

Vasulka's influence reached far beyond the world of video art, and his work has been recognized by countless institutions and organizations. He was awarded the Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1974, and his work was featured in the first three editions of the Venice Biennale of Art and Architecture. In 2016, he was honored with a solo exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.

Vasulka's death marks the loss of one of the most innovative and inspiring artists of the 20th century. His work challenged the accepted norms of art and technology, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and thinkers around the world. As we look back at his remarkable career, we can only hope that his vision will continue to guide us as we chart a course through the complexities of the modern world.
