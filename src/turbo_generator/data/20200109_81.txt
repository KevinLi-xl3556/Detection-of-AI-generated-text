A provocative work of art can confound expectations and leave a lasting impact on viewers, persisting long after they've departed the exhibit. Enter Pope.L, the performance artist whose work has captivated audiences worldwide. While many may know him for his astoundingly grueling crawls - he's traipsed through Midtown Manhattan on his belly up to 22 miles - what makes his art endure is deeper than spectacle.

At the core of his work lies an unrelenting exploration of societal norms and the constant turmoil of American power dynamics. Pope.L's creations deftly dismantle our preconceived notions of race and class, inviting audiences to question how it all fits into the framework of our daily lives. His pieces ask us to consider who we are and what we value in difficult, often shocking, ways.

One of Pope.L's most memorable works, "eRacism" at the Museum of Modern Art's retrospective of his work, utilized stark imagery and text to call attention to America's continued problems with race. The work featured photographs of Black bodies wrapped in cellophane like human packing material on industrial pallets, disquieting the viewer with the harsh reality of a world where Black lives don't suddenly matter. While the intense visuals may have initially drawn in viewers, it was the intellectual gauntlet that Pope.L laid down that kept them engaged long after they'd returned to the outside world.

Another memorable piece, "The Great White Way," saw Pope.L bleach a suit white and walk down Broadway for nine hours while wearing it. The performance, executed in 2001, was an intentional homage to the playwright Thornton Wilder, but it also represented a disruption to the stereotypical image of the Black man, which has long been completely antithetical to the very fabric of Manhattan.

More than just surface-level attention-getters or gimmickry, Pope.L's pieces create a space for open, honest dialogue about the complex issues facing America. His art demands that we, as viewers, engage with the difficult parts of our history that we'd rather forget, using his specific brand of performance and installation to strip away the veneer of societal expectation and face our discomfort with a relentless eye.

What makes Pope.L's work so enduring isn't just that it has added to the greater cultural cannon, but it continues to resonate now more than ever. In a moment where so much of America's history feels like it's being reevaluated, his art remains a necessary, vital mirror that challenges us to continue questioning our values, to question our norms, and to move towards a more just and compassionate society.
