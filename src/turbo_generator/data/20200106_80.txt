The 2020 U.S. presidential elections have provided voters with a stark contrast between two of the leading Democratic candidates’ foreign policies. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders’ divergent views on America’s role in the world have been widely covered in election news and have become a fundamental dividing line in the race.

Biden, a former vice president, and longtime senator have built his campaign around being an experienced, steady hand. His foreign policy platform is based on restoring America’s leadership in the world and promoting democratic values. He believes in working with allies and global institutions to take on issues like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and authoritarian regimes. Biden’s approach is rooted in diplomacy, multilateralism, and a belief in American exceptionalism.

Sanders, a Vermont senator and self-proclaimed democratic socialist, has a markedly different approach. His platform prioritizes the dignity and well-being of everyday Americans over international affairs. He has advocated for significantly reducing U.S. military involvement abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Sanders believes in using diplomacy and economic pressure to promote American values globally, rather than military might. He has also criticized free trade deals like NAFTA and TPP that he believes have hurt American workers.

The contrast between these two approaches has been evident in their debates, forums, and campaign speeches. In a CNN town hall, Sanders declared that the U.S. should "transform our foreign policy to meet the needs of working people." Biden has criticized Sanders' hesitation to use military force, arguing that the U.S. must be willing to use military might to protect its interests and those of its allies.

These differences have been particularly relevant in the wake of the recent U.S. assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Biden criticized the Trump administration for not consulting with Congress before the attack and suggested a more measured response to Iran's actions. Sanders, on the other hand, condemned the killing and has called for significantly reducing the U.S.'s military presence in the region.

Overall, the differences between Biden and Sanders on foreign policy are emblematic of broader debates within the Democratic Party about America's role in the world. As the U.S. continues to face new and varied international challenges, it is crucial to understand and evaluate the different approaches taken by these two leading candidates. Whichever approach American voters ultimately choose in November, the next president will define the country's place in the world for years to come.
