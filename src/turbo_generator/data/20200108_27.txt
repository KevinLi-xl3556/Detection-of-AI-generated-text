Elizabeth Wurtzel Was a Great Writer and a Better Friend

The world lost a brilliant writer, and I lost a great friend on January 7th, 2020, when Elizabeth Wurtzel passed away. Wurtzel was known for her frank, provocative, and deeply personal writing in books like "Prozac Nation" and "Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women." Her raw honesty about her struggles with mental illness and addiction, as well as her opinions on feminism and pop culture, made her a controversial figure, but also a beloved one to many readers.

What I will remember most about Elizabeth was not just her writing, but the person she was off the page. We met in college, both aspiring writers, and bonded over our shared love of literature, music, and fashion. Elizabeth was brilliant and opinionated, funny and loyal, and always full of surprises.

One of my fondest memories of her was when she came to visit me in Paris, where I was living at the time. She arrived, as usual, with no small amount of drama and baggage (literal and figurative), but her infectious energy and enthusiasm made everything seem possible. We spent our days wandering the streets, drinking champagne, and talking about everything from Proust to Prince.

But what I loved most about Elizabeth was how supportive and generous she was as a friend. When I was going through a tough time, she listened patiently and offered advice without judgment. When I got my first book deal, she was genuinely thrilled for me, and offered to blurb the book even though we had lost touch for a few years. She even gave me a pair of vintage Chanel earrings as a congratulatory gift, knowing how much I loved Coco and her designs.

Of course, Elizabeth was not a perfect person, and she had her demons to wrestle with. Our friendship had ups and downs, and we sometimes clashed over our differing viewpoints or the way we lived our lives. But through it all, I knew that Elizabeth had my back, and I had hers. That's what real friendship is all about.

In the wake of Elizabeth's passing, many have written about her legacy as a writer and a controversial figure in the feminist movement. But I want to remember her as a friend who made me laugh, challenged me to be a better writer, and inspired me to live my life with passion and purpose. She may not have been everyone's cup of tea, but she was mine, and I will miss her dearly.

Rest in peace, Elizabeth. You were a great writer, and an even better friend.
