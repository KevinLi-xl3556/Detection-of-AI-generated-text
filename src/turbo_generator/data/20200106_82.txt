Opinion | Killing Qassim Suleimani Was Illegal. And Predictable.

The assassination of Iran's top military commander, Major General Qassim Suleimani, by the United States on January 3, 2020, has sparked a fierce debate about the legality and morality of targeted killings. Despite the Trump administration's claim that Suleimani was planning "imminent" attacks on American targets, many legal experts and human rights advocates believe that the killing was illegal and violated international law.

Under the United Nations Charter and customary international law, the use of force is prohibited against other states except in self-defense or with the authorization of the UN Security Council. The Trump administration has argued that the killing of Suleimani was justified because he posed an imminent threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq, and that the strike was an act of self-defense. However, the evidence presented by the administration has been vague and unconvincing. The Pentagon has released no evidence of a specific attack that was imminent, and some key members of Congress have disputed the administration's account.

The targeted killing of Suleimani also raises broader questions about the use of lethal force in international affairs. Proponents of targeted killings argue that they are a necessary and effective way to disrupt terrorist networks and eliminate high-profile threats to national security. However, opponents argue that they violate the rule of law, undermine democratic values, and often have unintended consequences that make the situation worse.

In the case of Suleimani, the killing has already led to a dangerous escalation in the conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran retaliated for the killing by launching missile strikes on two U.S. military bases in Iraq, and tensions between the two countries remain high. The killing has also fueled anti-American sentiment in Iran and other parts of the Middle East, and raised concerns about the possibility of a wider war.

Despite the controversy and risks associated with targeted killings, they have become an increasingly popular tactic among the United States and other countries in the post-9/11 era. According to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the United States has carried out more than 2,500 drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other countries since 2004, resulting in the deaths of between 8,000 and 12,000 people. The vast majority of these casualties were not high-ranking militants, but rather civilians and low-level fighters.

The killing of Suleimani was not an aberration; it was the latest in a long line of extrajudicial assassinations carried out by the United States and other countries in the name of counterterrorism. These killings have been criticized by human rights groups, legal scholars, and many governments around the world, who argue that they violate the principles of due process and the rule of law.

In short, the killing of Qassim Suleimani was a significant and controversial act of violence that raises important questions about the legality and morality of targeted killings. While some may argue that it was necessary to eliminate a dangerous and implacable enemy of the United States, others will question whether the use of lethal force was truly justified or whether it will lead to further violence and instability in the Middle East. At a time when the world is facing unprecedented global threats, including terrorism, climate change, and pandemics, it is more important than ever to reaffirm the primacy of international law and human rights, and to reject the dangerous and destructive logic of extrajudicial killings.
