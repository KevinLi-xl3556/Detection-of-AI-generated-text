On Monday evening, The New York Times released its regular briefing covering significant news stories happening around the world. The briefing consists of three major topics, including Iran, John Bolton, and Harvey Weinstein.

Firstly, with regards to Iran, tensions continue to rise as the country announces it will be restarting its uranium enrichment program, a move in violation of the international nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The decision comes in response to the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement last year and reimpose harsh economic sanctions on the country. The move is seen as a negotiating tactic to pressure the remaining signatories of the JCPOA to alleviate the impact of US sanctions.

Secondly, the briefing addressed the departure of National Security Advisor John Bolton from the White House. The sudden resignation, which came via Twitter, has sparked speculation over the reasons behind Bolton's exit. Bolton was well-known for his hawkish approach to foreign policy and his hard-line stance towards Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. His departure may signal a shift in the Trump administration's foreign policy approach, with some experts suggesting that the departure of Bolton could help improve relations with Iran.

Finally, the third topic addressed in the briefing was the ongoing legal proceedings of Harvey Weinstein. The disgraced Hollywood producer and former powerhouse is facing multiple sexual assault and harassment charges, with his trial set to begin in January 2020. The briefing reviews the pre-trial hearing that took place on Monday, in which Weinstein's defense team argued for a change in venue, citing potential bias in Manhattan. The judge ultimately denied the request, stating that an impartial jury could still be selected.

In conclusion, the Monday evening briefing provided a snapshot of world events, highlighting the complex and interconnected nature of politics, foreign relations, and legal proceedings. With developments in Iran, changes in the White House, and legal proceedings for Weinstein, each topic remains influential on the global stage, with their continuing stories to watch.
