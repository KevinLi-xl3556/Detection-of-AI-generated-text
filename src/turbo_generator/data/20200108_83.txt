Winter snow and frigid temperatures may be upon us, but there's another reason why you may want to stay bundled up as the season gets fully underway: the flu. According to new reports from The New York Times, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is warning that the ongoing flu season may yet turn ugly, with rising numbers of infections and even more hospitalizations and fatalities than last year.

The CDC reports show that the flu season is starting relatively mild, with fewer cases being reported across the country than this time last year. However, the agency is expecting that flu activity will ramp up in the coming weeks, and health officials warn that it's difficult to predict the severity or duration of flu season. Many people are questioning whether or not they need to worry about the flu this year, but the answer is clear: yes.

Despite the relatively mild start to the flu season, the virus can be deadly, especially for those with weakened immune systems, and even for healthy people with no underlying health conditions. One of the biggest concerns, according to the CDC, is the emergence of the H3N2 strain of the flu virus, which tends to cause more severe symptoms and complications in patients.

The CDC recommends that everyone over the age of six months receive a flu vaccine before the virus begins to circulate in their communities. The flu vaccine is typically highly effective at preventing infection, and can also help reduce the severity of symptoms in those who do contract the virus. While some people may experience mild side effects after receiving a flu shot, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks, according to health experts.

In addition to getting vaccinated, other simple measures can help protect you and your loved ones from the flu. Washing your hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home and away from others when you're feeling ill are all important steps you can take to reduce your risk of contracting or spreading the flu.

While there's no surefire way to guarantee that you won't contract the flu this season, taking steps like getting vaccinated and practicing good hygiene can help reduce your risk. With the CDC warning that the flu season may yet get worse, it's more important than ever to take the virus seriously and take proactive steps to protect yourself and those around you.
