The recent military escalation between the United States and Iran has left many Americans wondering what led to such a prolonged and deadly conflict. While the blame for the escalating tensions must be shared among several actors, it is also important to recognize that the United States bears some responsibility for the violence that has taken place.

For decades, the United States has maintained a hostile relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran. From the 1953 coup against democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh to the imposition of economic sanctions in 2018, the United States has consistently sought to undermine Iran's national sovereignty and destabilize its government.

This historical context did not end with the most recent military escalation, which began when President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. While the Iranian regime is not the likeliest partner for peace, the United States must recognize its own role in provoking and perpetuating the conflict with Iran.

The roots of this conflict can be traced back to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, during which the United States supported the ousted autocratic regime of the Shah. The Revolutionary government, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, was hostile to the United States due to its history of supporting Iran's dictators. In 1980, the United States launched a disastrous military operation to rescue 52 hostages in Iran, solidifying Iranian anti-American sentiment.

Since then, the United States has continued to antagonize the Iranian regime, most notably through targeted sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. While the stated goal of these sanctions is to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, their true impact has been to foment widespread societal unrest and undermine the country's ability to provide for its citizens.

Furthermore, the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 only exacerbated tensions, undermining trust between the two nations and further destabilizing the region. President Trump's recent threat to target Iranian cultural sites, which are protected under international law, further highlights the extremes to which the United States is willing to go in its conflict with Iran.

It is easy to view Iran as a belligerent and authoritarian regime, and it is true that the Iranian leadership has engaged in numerous violent and objectionable activities. However, by taking a myopic view that ignores the United States' history of aggression towards Iran, we risk ignoring the fact that our own actions have contributed to the violence and instability in the Middle East.

As citizens of the United States, we must acknowledge our responsibility for the cycle of violence that has characterized our relationship with Iran. It is only through a willingness to pursue dialogue and understanding, rather than military intervention, that we can hope to bring about a more peaceful and stable future. Until then, Iranian blood will be on our hands, too.
