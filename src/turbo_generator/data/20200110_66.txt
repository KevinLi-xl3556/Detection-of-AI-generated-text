The downing of a Ukrainian passenger airplane on January 8th, 2020 was a tragedy of immense proportions. The loss of 176 lives is an irreparable and devastating loss that has left families and friends in mourning. The incident occurred in the midst of escalating tensions between Iran and the United States, following the United Statesâ€™ targeted killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. In light of the events, many are looking to assign blame for the downed airliner. 

The initial reaction of the Iranian government was to deny involvement in the incident, claiming that the aircraft had suffered a technical malfunction. However, information soon emerged that the plane had been shot down by missiles fired by an Iranian military unit. Iran eventually admitted responsibility for the incident, citing "human error".

The tragedy has sparked a wave of international condemnation, with countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom and Ukraine calling for an independent international inquiry into the matter. In light of the incident, assessing blame has become a matter of utmost importance in the international community. 

It is clear that the downed Ukrainian airliner is a direct result of the failure of the Iranian government to ensure adequate measures were taken to prevent human error in its military operations. The incident also highlights the complexity and dangers associated with military responses to political events, particularly those that involve the use of lethal force. 

There is also an important lesson to be learned concerning the need for increased transparency and openness from governments during times of crisis. The initial attempt by the Iranian government to deny involvement in the incident indicates a lack of responsibility and transparency on its part. The fact that it took three days for the Iranian government to take responsibility for the downing of the aircraft is particularly concerning.

Ultimately, the tragedy must serve as a wake-up call for all governments to ensure that the lives of innocent civilians are not placed in danger in times of political tension. The need for transparency and accountability is paramount, particularly in times of conflict. 

As the international community continues to mourn the loss of innocent lives, it is crucial that we do not forget the lessons learned from this tragedy. We must work together to prevent future incidents and ensure that the blame for such tragedies is assigned in a fair and just manner. In doing so, we can honor the memory of those who were lost in this terrible tragedy, and work towards a more peaceful and just world.
