Georges Duboeuf, a prominent figure in the wine industry known for creating the Beaujolais Nouveau craze, has died at the age of 86. Duboeuf passed away on January 4th, 2020, due to complications from a stroke.

Duboeuf was born in 1933 in the French town of Creches-sur-Saone. He began his career in the wine industry at the age of 18, working for his family's wine merchant business. In 1957, he founded his own wine distribution company, Les Vins Georges Duboeuf, which eventually became the largest wine merchant in the Beaujolais region.

One of Duboeuf's most significant contributions to the wine industry was his creation of the Beaujolais Nouveau craze. In the 1970s, Duboeuf began promoting the release of Beaujolais Nouveau, a young, fruity wine made from Gamay grapes that had only been harvested a few weeks prior. Duboeuf's marketing campaign surrounding the release of Beaujolais Nouveau, which takes place on the third Thursday of November every year, was so successful that it quickly became a global phenomenon.

The Beaujolais Nouveau craze brought attention to the otherwise obscure and overlooked Beaujolais wine region, which is located in eastern France, just south of Burgundy. It also inspired other winemakers to create their own "nouveau" wines, such as the Vin de Primeur in the Languedoc region.

Duboeuf was known for his love of the Beaujolais region and its wines. He worked tirelessly to promote the region and its winemakers, even organizing an annual wine fair in the town of Roman√®che-Thorins, which attracted thousands of visitors each year.

Duboeuf was also a pioneer in the use of technology in winemaking. He was one of the first winemakers in France to use computerized temperature control systems, which allowed for more consistent and higher quality wines.

In addition to his contributions to the wine industry, Duboeuf was also a philanthropist. He established a foundation to support charities in the Beaujolais region, and was known for his generosity and support of local causes.

Duboeuf's legacy in the wine industry will not be forgotten. His contributions to the popularity of the Beaujolais Nouveau wine and the promotion of the Beaujolais region have had a lasting impact on the industry as a whole. He will be remembered as a true pioneer and leader in the world of wine.
