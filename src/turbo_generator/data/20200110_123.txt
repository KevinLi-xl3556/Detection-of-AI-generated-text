Ilana Glazer, the comedian and actress best known for co-creating and starring in the hit TV series “Broad City,” is also an avid theatergoer. In a recent interview with the New York Times, she spoke about her experiences with two powerful theatrical productions that left a lasting impact on her: “Slave Play” and “I Am Vanessa.”

First on Glazer’s list was “Slave Play,” which premiered Off-Broadway at New York Theater Workshop in 2018 before transferring to Broadway in 2019. Written by Jeremy O. Harris and directed by Robert O’Hara, “Slave Play” is a provocative exploration of race, power, and desire in the context of modern-day America.

Glazer described “Slave Play” as “so moving” and “so exhausting,” praising its “mind-blowing” acting and design, as well as its willingness to challenge audiences on difficult and uncomfortable topics. “It’s a weird and funny and smart and thoughtful play,” she said. “It really, really blew my mind.”

Alongside “Slave Play,” Glazer also highlighted “I Am Vanessa,” by Vanessa Garcia and directed by Colombia Lopez, which premiered virtually in October 2020. The play tells the harrowing true story of Chanel Miller, who was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner in 2015 and became the subject of a high-profile legal case and media frenzy.

Glazer described “I Am Vanessa” as “incredible” and “so painful,” commending its “excellent” performances and direction. She expressed particular admiration for the way the play honored and amplified Miller’s voice and perspective, giving her the chance to tell her story in her own words and defy the ways in which she had been silenced and belittled in the past.

Glazer’s passion for theater is clear in her thoughtful, impassioned discussions of these two productions. In both “Slave Play” and “I Am Vanessa,” she found works that challenged and inspired her, that pushed her outside her comfort zone and made her reflect on her own beliefs and assumptions. These are the kinds of experiences that truly great theater can offer, and it’s heartening to see that they still exist, even amidst the challenges of pandemic and social upheaval.
