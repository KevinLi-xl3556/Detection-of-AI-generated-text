Title: Trump’s Move Against Landmark Environmental Law Caps a Relentless Agenda

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the Trump administration is rolling back regulations on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to expedite the construction of highways, pipelines, and other infrastructure projects while bypassing environmental reviews.

The decision is seen as capping off the president's relentless assault on environmental protections since taking office, and environmental groups warn that the changes will have dire long-term impacts on the country's natural resources.

The NEPA was signed into law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon to ensure that major federal projects, such as those related to energy, transportation, and infrastructure, are reviewed for their environmental impacts and are open to public comment.

The law has been credited with saving hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness and preventing the kind of large-scale industrial projects that have caused significant environmental damage.

Speaking to The New York Times, Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, declared that the rollback "will mean more pollution, more illness, and more environmental degradation at a time when our communities can least afford it."

The changes have been much sought by the construction industry and other business interests who have long complained that the review process is too onerous and lengthy and causes costly delays.

Yet the new rules will primarily benefit large corporations by expediting their projects, while leaving local communities and environmental advocates as well as smaller businesses without the information and mechanisms to fully assess the potential of proposed projects.

The Trump administration has repeatedly dismissed the importance of environmental protections, rolling back over 100 environmental regulations while in office, dismantling the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement.

The decision on NEPA, set to take effect after a 60-day comment period, comes amid calls to the government to prioritize concerns over climate change and promote a green recovery following the covid-19 pandemic.

The administration's stance on environmental protections has drawn the condemnation of many, who question the president's willingness to put the planet's future at risk in exchange for short-term economic benefits.

As Michael Brune puts it, "The Trump administration’s reckless attempt to gut the most basic environmental safeguards and silence communities’ voices will not go unchecked."
