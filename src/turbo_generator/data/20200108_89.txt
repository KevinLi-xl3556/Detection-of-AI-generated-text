The New-York Historical Society has acquired the papers and archive of acclaimed biographer Robert Caro. The institution announced on May 10 that it has obtained what it called “a comprehensive archive” of Caro’s work, including research materials, interview tapes, and draft manuscripts.

The collection is an exceptional addition to the society’s holdings, which already include an extensive collection of important documents and artifacts related to New York City’s history and culture.

Caro, who is now 85, has been a regular presence in American letters for more than half a century, producing works that are acclaimed for their meticulous research and elegant writing. His best-known works include biographies of Robert Moses, the legendary New York City planner and political figure, and of Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president of the United States.

The acquisition of Caro’s papers by the New-York Historical Society is a major development for scholars, historians, and researchers, who can now access an extensive archive documenting the creative process behind some of the most important works of recent American history.

In a statement announcing the acquisition, Louise Mirrer, the president and CEO of the New-York Historical Society, emphasized Caro’s significance as a writer and researcher. “[His] work embodies the ideals of our institution,” Mirrer said. “His commitment to rigorous historical research and his artistry as a writer have created a body of work that has had a profound impact on our understanding of American history and politics.”

Caro’s archive will provide an unprecedented glimpse into the process behind the writer’s celebrated works, including the multiple volumes of his Johnson biography. The archive includes handwritten notes, interview transcripts, and other materials that reveal the writer’s exhaustive process of research and writing.

The acquisition of the archive is also a significant cultural event, marking the arrival of one of America’s greatest living writers into the city’s cultural institutions. Caro, who has lived in New York for the past half-century, expressed his excitement about having his papers housed at the New-York Historical Society.

“I’m thrilled that my papers will be part of the collection of the New-York Historical Society,” Caro said in a statement. “I’ve always been inspired by the Society’s dedication to preserving and promoting the history of New York, and I’m honored that my work will now be part of that legacy.”

The acquisition of Robert Caro’s archive by the New-York Historical Society is a major step forward for the institution and a boon for scholars and researchers. With its acquisition of the archive, the Society has cemented its reputation as one of the premier repositories of historical documents and materials in the United States.
