The Twitter account of The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical, currently playing on Broadway, has gained a reputation for its witty, irreverent posts and engaging audience interactions. But what many don't know is that the person behind the account is a Tony Award-winning writer.

Steven Levenson, who won the Tony for Best Book of a Musical for Dear Evan Hansen in 2017, has been moonlighting as the person behind the Lightning Thief Twitter account since its inception. In an interview with The New York Times, Levenson revealed that he took on the task as a way to stay connected with the show and engage with its young and enthusiastic fan base.

"I love Twitter as a platform for engaging with audiences," Levenson said. "It allows us to connect with fans in a way that feels immediate and personal, and it can be a great tool for building excitement around the show."

Levenson's tweets often feature playful banter with fans, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the production and cast, and humorous references to the Percy Jackson book series on which the musical is based. The account has amassed over 20,000 followers, many of them young fans who have fallen in love with the show's catchy songs and humorous take on Greek mythology.

But Levenson is quick to emphasize that his work on the Twitter account is in no way a distraction from his day job as a writer. "It's important to me to stay connected to the show and to the fans, but my main focus is always my writing," he said. "This is just a fun way to engage with people and share my love for the musical."

The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical, which opened on Broadway in October 2019, has received positive reviews for its energetic performances and catchy music. The show's success on social media, thanks in part to Levenson's savvy Twitter presence, has helped to boost its profile and attract new audiences.

As for Levenson, he remains committed to both writing and engaging with fans on social media. "I'm lucky to be able to do what I love and share it with others," he said. "And if I can make people laugh or feel a little better through my tweets, then that's just icing on the cake."
