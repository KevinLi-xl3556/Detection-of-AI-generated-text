In recent days, the tension between the United States and Iran has escalated to a dangerous point. The US airstrike that killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani has resulted in a retaliatory missile attack by Iran on American military bases in Iraq. In the midst of this crisis, the right-wing media has been grappling with President Trump's decision to order the strike – and Tucker Carlson has emerged as a dissenting voice within the conservative movement.

In a monologue on his show on Fox News, Carlson lashed out at the Trump administration's foreign policy, emphasizing that the attack on Soleimani would not make Americans safer. Carlson specifically criticized Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien for allegedly pushing Trump into the decision.

"Who’s actually benefited from this? Getting rid of Soleimani is no small thing, but the question is what comes next," Carlson said. "Is Iran really the greatest threat we face?"

This stance puts Carlson at odds with many conservatives, who have rallied around Trump's decision. Numerous right-wing pundits have celebrated the attack as a bold move that sends a message to America's enemies. Some have even argued that the strike could be a prelude to regime change in Iran.

However, Carlson's skepticism towards hawkish foreign policy is not entirely surprising. He has repeatedly criticized the US's military engagements abroad, arguing in 2018 that "there's no advantage for us in Afghanistan." Carlson's views on foreign policy also align with his populist views on issues like trade and immigration.

Carlson's dissenting voice is particularly significant given his status as one of the most popular figures in conservative media. He has a large viewership and a considerable influence over the opinions of Republican voters. His criticism of Trump's foreign policy may force other conservatives to reconsider their own views on the matter.

Regardless of the outcome of this crisis, the implications of Carlson's critiques of the Trump administration are worth considering beyond the current moment. His questioning of the premise that Iran poses an existential threat to the US may have a lasting impact on the conservative movement's stance toward foreign policy. If Carlson's dissent continues to resonate with conservative voters, it could lead to a shift away from the neo-conservative foreign policy that has characterized the party for decades.
