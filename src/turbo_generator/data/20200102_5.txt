As the world spins on, we bring you the latest happenings from around the globe. Here’s your Thursday evening briefing.

Iraq:

As the United States’ military presence tapers off in Iraq, the nation braces itself for what’s to come. The US’s decision to withdraw its troops from Iraq has sparked concern that the nearly two-decade-long war may have left the country vulnerable to the resurfacing of extremist groups. The situation in Iraq remains tenuous.

Carlos Ghosn:

The recent escape of former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn from Japan, where he was facing corruption charges, has captivated the world. Ghosn, who fled the country in a cunningly woven plot involving a music box and a double bass case, evading the attempts of Japanese authorities to bring him to trial, has reignited debates about the relationship between justice and power. Despite being hailed as a hero in some quarters and criticized as a criminal in others, Ghosn’s story has become a symbol of the complexities of international justice.

Tumbleweeds:

In an unusual occurrence, a small town in the state of California has found itself plagued by a tumbleweed invasion. Victorville, a small city of 120,000 people, has been overrun by the plants, which threaten to turn the streets into a sea of straw. The tumbleweeds have become a problem for motorists and homeowners alike, with some reporting complete blockages of their driveways. Despite workers’ best efforts to remove the weeds, strong winds have meant that they continue to pile up in the town, rendering it all but unrecognizable.

As the world turns, so too do the fortunes of nations and individuals. From the upheavals in Iraq, to the flight of Carlos Ghosn, to the tumbleweed invasion of California, we are reminded of the twists and turns that life can take. We must be prepared for what is to come, for better or for worse.
