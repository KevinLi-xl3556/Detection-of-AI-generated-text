As we spend more and more time at home, finding comfortable and cozy loungewear has become a top priority. But what if we could find something that not only feels good to wear around the house, but also looks stylish enough to wear out in public? Enter The T List from The New York Times, which features a roundup of the best comfy robes and other loungewear essentials that you'll want to wear both inside and outside your home.

One standout piece from the list is the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe. Made from ultra-soft and plush microfiber fabric, this robe feels like a warm hug wrapped around your body. But it's also stylish enough to wear as a statement piece over leggings and a t-shirt for a chic and effortless look. Plus, it has pockets for added convenience.

Another top pick is the Lunya Washable Silk Robe. This luxurious robe is made from 100% silk that's machine washable (yes, you read that right). The silk is not only soft and silky to the touch, but also regulates your body temperature, keeping you cool when it's hot and warm when it's cold. With a flattering wrap design and a range of beautiful colors, this robe can easily be dressed up or down.

If you prefer something with a bit more structure, the Pangaia Organic Cotton Robe is a great option. Made from 100% organic cotton, this robe has a structured collar and cuffs, making it look more like a casual blazer than a robe. The oversized fit and soft texture still give it that cozy feel, though, and it can easily be dressed up with jeans and boots.

The T List also features other loungewear essentials, like soft pajamas, comfortable slippers, and cozy blankets. Whether you're working from home or simply relaxing on the couch, these pieces will make you feel comfortable and stylish at the same time. So go ahead and ditch those sweatpants- with these comfy robes and other loungewear essentials, you'll never want to take them off!
