The music industry has suffered a huge loss today as Neil Peart, the legendary drummer and lyricist for Canadian rock band Rush, passed away on January 7th, 2020. He was 67 years old. Peart had been battling brain cancer for the past three and a half years.

Peart was widely regarded as one of the greatest drummers in rock history, known for his technical skills and intricate drumming patterns. He joined Rush in 1974, and over the next four decades, he and his bandmates - Geddy Lee on vocals and bass, and Alex Lifeson on guitar - released more than 20 albums and played countless concerts around the world.

But Peart was more than just a percussionist. He was also the band's primary lyricist, writing songs that explored themes of science fiction, philosophy, and personal growth. His lyrics were often poetic and philosophical, reflecting his own interests in literature, history, and travel.

Born in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1952, Peart began playing drums when he was a teenager. He joined Rush in 1974, just in time for the recording of the band's second album, "Fly by Night." It was an auspicious start, and over the next few years, Rush became one of the most popular and critically acclaimed hard rock bands in the world.

Peart's drumming was a large part of the band's appeal. He was known for his complex rhythms, his use of unusual time signatures, and his intricate drum solos. He also incorporated a wide range of percussion instruments into his playing, from congas and timbales to cowbells and chimes.

But Peart's role in the band extended beyond his drumming. He was also responsible for writing most of the band's lyrics, which often dealt with themes of individualism, freedom, and the search for truth. Peart's lyrics were informed by his own extensive reading - he was known to be a voracious reader of books on history, philosophy, and science fiction.

Peart was also an avid motorcyclist, and his travels on his bike often influenced his songwriting. In the early 2000s, he published a book about his motorcycle journeys, titled "Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road." The book chronicled a difficult period in his life, during which he lost both his daughter and his wife within the space of a year.

Despite these tragedies, Peart continued to play with Rush until the band's retirement in 2015. Peart was widely respected by his peers, and his influence on the world of rock music cannot be overstated. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013, and his legacy will live on through his music for many years to come.

There are few words that can adequately express the sadness felt by the music community today. Neil Peart was a true original, a drummer and lyricist of unparalleled talent and creativity. He will be deeply missed.
