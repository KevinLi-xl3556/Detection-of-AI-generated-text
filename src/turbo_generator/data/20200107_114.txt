He Fled Iran as a Child. Now He’s Commanding a U.S. Aircraft Carrier.

The story of Rear Adm. Shahin M. “Sean” Seyedepour is one of resilience, hard work, and dedication. Born in Iran in 1963, Seyedepour's life was uprooted in 1979 when the Islamic revolution tore apart the country's political and social fabric. Seeking a new life, the 16-year-old boy fled Iran in the middle of the night with his family, leaving behind everything they knew and loved. 

Settling in the United States, Seyedepour began a new life in a new land, speaking little English and with few resources. However, he was determined to succeed and worked hard to learn the language and culture of his new home. His hard work paid off, and he excelled academically, earning a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles.

Seyedepour soon joined the U.S. Navy, where he began a long and notable career that has seen him rise through the ranks to become a rear admiral in charge of one of the most important and challenging military posts there is: commanding a U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan.

The USS Ronald Reagan is one of the Navy's most advanced and powerful warships, capable of carrying out a wide range of missions, from humanitarian relief efforts to full-scale combat operations. As its commander, Seyedepour is responsible for leading a crew of over 5,000 sailors and Marines, ensuring the ship is ready for any contingency, and making critical decisions that can mean the difference between success and failure.

Despite the challenges, Seyedepour has thrived in his role, earning the respect and admiration of his fellow sailors and leaders alike. He is known for his calm and steady leadership style, his dedication to his crew, and his deep knowledge of the ship and its capabilities.

In many ways, Seyedepour's success is a testament to the power of hard work and determination, even in the face of the most daunting challenges. Despite the many obstacles that he has faced throughout his life, he has never lost sight of his goals or his commitment to serve his country.

In an era of growing political divisions and social strife, Seyedepour's story is a reminder of the values that have long made America great: hard work, determination, and dedication to a worthy cause. It is a story that inspires us all to strive for excellence, to overcome adversity, and to make a positive impact on the world around us.
