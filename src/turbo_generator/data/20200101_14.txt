In a powerful display of unity and resilience, 90,000 Jews gathered on Sunday to pray and defy a recent wave of hate that has swept across the United States.

The event, dubbed the "United We Stand" rally, took place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and was organized by a coalition of Jewish organizations. It was attended by Jews from all walks of life, including members of the Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements.

The rally came just days after a string of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City, including a stabbing spree during a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, which left five people injured. The surge in anti-Semitic incidents has left many in the Jewish community feeling anxious and vulnerable.

But the "United We Stand" rally provided a powerful reminder that the Jewish community is not alone in its struggle against hate. Speakers at the event included prominent politicians, religious leaders, and community activists, who called on all Americans to stand together in the face of bigotry and prejudice.

"We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced. We will not be afraid," said Rabbi Avi Schnall, the director of Agudath Israel of America. "We will continue to live our lives with pride and dignity, and we will not allow the forces of hate to tear us apart."

The event also served as a platform for members of the Jewish community to reflect on their own history of persecution and resilience. Many attendees wore black-and-white striped jackets to symbolize the uniforms worn by prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.

"We have been through this before," said David Harris, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee. "We have faced dehumanization, exclusion, and oppression. And yet, here we are, stronger than ever."

Despite the challenges facing the Jewish community, the "United We Stand" rally demonstrated a sense of hope and determination that was felt by all who attended. Jews from across the country came together to pray, sing, and stand in solidarity with one another, sending a powerful message that hate will not defeat them.

As Rabbi Schnall put it, "We may be under attack, but we will not be defeated. On the contrary, we will emerge from this stronger and more united than ever."
