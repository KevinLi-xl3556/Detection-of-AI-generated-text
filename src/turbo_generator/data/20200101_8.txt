Hate is an insidious and old feeling that has plagued humanity for centuries. It is a feeling that can completely take over a person and make them blind to reason and empathy. Unfortunately, it is a feeling that is still prevalent in society today, especially in the form of anti-Semitism.

New York has always been a melting pot of different cultures, religions, and communities. It is a city that prides itself on the diversity and inclusivity of its citizens. However, recent incidents of anti-Semitic hate crimes have shaken this image of the city.

On December 28th, 2019, during the celebration of Hanukkah, a stabbing occurred at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, a town in New York. This was just one of the many incidents that have occurred in recent years, including the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.

The rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes is a deeply concerning trend that cannot be ignored. It is an issue that affects all New Yorkers, regardless of their background or religion. The mayor of New York City, Bill De Blasio, has stated that “anti-Semitism is an attack on the values of our city — and we will confront it head-on, together.”

New Yorkers have always been known for their resilience and ability to come together in times of adversity. This is a time where this resilience must be put to the test. We must stand together and denounce hatred and bigotry in all its forms. This is not just a Jewish issue; it is an issue that affects everyone.

It is important that we take a stand against hate and show that New York is a city that will not tolerate such behavior. It is time for our leaders to take action and create policies that hold people accountable for their actions. It is also crucial for all New Yorkers to speak out against hate and to report any incidents that they witness.

New York has always been a city that looks towards the future, where progress and growth are at the forefront. Let us not allow hate to hold us back from achieving the greatness that we aspire to. Let us stand up and come together to build a better and more inclusive future for all New Yorkers.
