As tensions between the United States and Iran continue to escalate, a powerful group of voices is emerging in opposition to war: veterans. These men and women who have served their country and seen the horrors of combat firsthand are sounding the alarm about the risks and costs of another conflict in the Middle East.

Their reluctance to support a new war is understandable. Many of these veterans have already sacrificed deeply in service to their country, experiencing the physical and emotional tolls of combat. They know firsthand the human cost of war - its toll on families, communities, and the entire nation.

Moreover, these veterans understand better than most the realities on the ground in the Middle East. They know that another war in the region will only increase hostility and violence, making our troops and the region less safe. They know that a new war will only serve to embolden extremist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda, exacerbating the very issues that the United States has spent years trying to address.

These veterans are speaking out against war with Iran, urging policymakers to consider the long-term consequences of their decisions. They are calling for a diplomatic path forward, one that prioritizes dialogue and engagement over military confrontation.

But their calls for restraint are being met with skepticism from some quarters. There are those who believe that military force is the only way to address the threat posed by Iran - who see war as a necessary evil in the pursuit of security.

This is a dangerous mindset. It ignores the lessons of history, which have shown that war often leads to unintended consequences and exacerbates underlying tensions. It also ignores the voices of those who have already suffered the consequences of war, and who understand the true nature of its costs.

It is time for our leaders to listen to the voices of these weary veterans. It is time to pursue a path of diplomacy and engagement with Iran, rather than one of military force. This approach may not offer quick fixes or easy solutions. But it is the only way to build a lasting peace in the region - one that will serve both the interests of the United States and the cause of global stability.
