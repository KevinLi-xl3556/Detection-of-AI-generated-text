In today's world, places of worship have become targets of violence. Churches have been robbed, vandalized, and even attacked by gunmen. The threats are so intense that religious establishments across the world have started developing new security protocols to protect their congregants.

One church in Texas is taking these threats seriously and is planning to protect its members in a unique way: by arming them with Bibles and hot coffee.

The Eastwood Church in Arlington, Texas, has organized special training sessions for its members. During these classes, members are taught how to hurl Bibles at an attacker in a bid to weaken and deter them. Pastors at the church said that they were inspired by the story of David and Goliath from the Bible and the idea of using unconventional means to defeat enemies.

Church staff also said that if throwing Bibles wasn't enough, they have hot coffee on standby. In the event of an attack, church security guards would hand the members hot coffee to throw at the attacker.

The church has also installed several security cameras and panic buttons to alert local law enforcement authorities of any potential danger. Pastor Smith, one of the pastors at Eastwood Church, said that the Church has also started offering firearm training lessons for its members.

The Eastwood Church's proactive approach to security has received mixed reactions from the public. While some see it as a creative way to protect worshipers, others question whether it is appropriate to encourage congregants to engage in violent behavior. But the staff at the Eastwood Church insists that their approach is all about being prepared and taking necessary precautions.

In conclusion, the Eastwood Church is taking security measures to the next level by arming its members with not just Bibles, but also hot coffee. While the initiative may seem unconventional, it signals that religious institutions are taking the threat of violence seriously and taking action to protect their congregants.
