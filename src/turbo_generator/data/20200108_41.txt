In recent weeks, many individuals in the United States have reportedly received text messages telling them that they have been drafted into the U.S. military. These texts, which generally come from unknown sources, have caused widespread alarm and confusion among those who receive them. However, according to the U.S. Army, these texts are entirely false and are not to be trusted.

This widespread hoax has sparked a significant response from the Army, which has made it clear that there is no draft currently happening in the United States. The Army has also emphasized that it would never contact potential recruits via text message, email, or any other unsolicited method. Furthermore, the Army has warned that anyone who receives such a message should not reply or provide any personal information.

In response to the widespread hoax, the Army has been working closely with law enforcement agencies to track down the source of the fake texts. The Army has emphasized that it takes any threat of fraudulent behavior seriously and is working tirelessly to put a stop to this false information.

The Army has also expressed sympathy for those who have been emotionally affected by these messages, particularly young people who may be particularly vulnerable to the false notion that they are about to be drafted. The Army has stated that its recruitment processes are always transparent, and it does not aim to alarm or deceive anyone.

Overall, these fake texts have caused needless worry and confusion among many Americans. However, the Army has made it clear that they are entirely false and should not be trusted. Instead, the Army has encouraged anyone who receives such a message to contact their local law enforcement agencies immediately, report the message and block the sender. The Army assures the public that their recruitment process is transparent and emphasized that the health and well-being of all potential recruits is their utmost priority.
