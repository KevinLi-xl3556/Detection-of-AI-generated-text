On December 9th, 2019, Brazil's top court, the Supreme Federal Court (STF), lifted the ban on the Netflix film 'The First Temptation of Christ' that portrays Jesus as gay, overturning a ruling by a lower court. The decision by the STF was met with mixed reactions, arousing controversy and debate between supporters and opponents of the movie.

The movie, produced by the Brazilian comedy group Porta Dos Fundos, portrays Jesus returning home for his 30th birthday party with his boyfriend, Orlando. The film sparked outrage among many conservative groups, including religious leaders and politicians, who denounced it as an attack on Christianity and urged for its removal from the streaming service. In turn, the production team faced several threats and attacks, including a firebombing of the Porta Dos Fundos headquarters in Rio de Janeiro on Christmas Eve 2019.

The backlash resulted in a court-ordered ban on the film in January 2020, which the Porta Dos Fundos and Netflix appealed, arguing that the ruling violated freedom of speech and the arts. The STF now agreed, ruling that the ban infringed on constitutional principles, as it violated the right to free expression and artistic creation in Brazil. In addition, the court noted that the movie is labeled on Netflix as intended for adults and features a warning about its content before playing.

The decision by the STF has been celebrated by advocates of free speech, who argue that censorship should not be justified by religious sensitivities. It was widely seen as a victory for LGBTQ rights in Brazil, a country where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2013, but where hate crimes against LGBTQ individuals remain frequent. The film's defenders see it as a satire that pokes fun at religious dogma and stereotypes, while its detractors view it as blasphemy and sacrilege.

The ruling by Brazil's highest court underscores the importance of protecting freedom of expression and artistic creation, even when they challenge widely held beliefs and provoke controversy. It also highlights the tension between religious beliefs and minority rights in Brazil, a country with a long history of political and social struggles. As society becomes increasingly diverse and pluralistic, it is essential to protect and defend the rights of all individuals and groups, including those whose views and lifestyles may differ from our own. In a democratic society, the ability to express oneself freely, without fear of censorship or violence, is essential. As Brazilian Justice Gilmar Mendes argued, "freedom of expression is a fundamental pillar of democratic regimes, which cannot flourish without diverse opinions and perspectives." By allowing the film to be shown, the STF has reaffirmed this principle and safeguarded the right to artistic expression in Brazil.
