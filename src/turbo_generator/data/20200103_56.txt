First up, nothing says comfort food quite like a big, hearty pot of chili. This classic dish is endlessly customizable, so feel free to tweak the recipe to suit your specific tastes. You can opt for a classic beef chili, or mix things up with a vegetarian or chicken version. Serve it up with some homemade cornbread or a dollop of sour cream, and you're in for a meal that will stick to your ribs all weekend long!

If you're in the mood for something a little lighter, why not try your hand at making your own sushi rolls? Making sushi might seem intimidating at first, but with a little practice and some guidance, it's actually quite simple. Plus, the end result is a beautiful and delicious meal that's perfect for enjoying with friends or family.

Another great option when it comes to weekend cooking is to fire up the grill and whip up some juicy burgers. Whether you prefer a classic cheeseburger or something a little more inventive (hello, avocado and bacon toppings!), there's no denying that a perfectly cooked burger is the ultimate weekend indulgence.

And if all else fails, don't be afraid to go the sweet route with some indulgent dessert recipes. From classic chocolate chip cookies to homemade ice cream and everything in between, there's no shortage of sweet treats to satisfy your cravings this weekend.

So there you have it - our top picks for what to cook this weekend. Whether you're in the mood for comfort food, fresh sushi, juicy burgers or something sweet, we hope these recipes inspire you to get creative in the kitchen and whip up something truly delicious. Happy cooking!
