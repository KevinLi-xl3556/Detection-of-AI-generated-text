In the aftermath of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's announcement to step back as senior members of the British royal family, much has been said about the couple's motives for their decision. Some have speculated that Meghan Markle, who is biracial and has faced racism and prejudice from the British press and public, was the driving force behind this decision. However, for black Britons, it is all too clear why Meghan would want to leave.

Black Britons have long been aware of the racism and discrimination that exists in British society. Despite official efforts to promote equality and inclusion, racism remains a persistent problem. Black Britons face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system, among other areas. They also face hostility from segments of the British public who have been emboldened by xenophobic rhetoric in recent years.

Meghan Markle's experiences in the British media have brought these issues to the forefront. Since her engagement to Prince Harry was announced in late 2017, she has been the target of racist and sexist abuse from certain sections of the British press. She has been referred to as "straight outta Compton" and "the ghetto Cinderella," and her marriage to Prince Harry has been described as "tainting the royal bloodline." Markle has also been criticized for her "American" mannerisms and accused of "sacrificing" her career and independence for the royal family.

The abuse directed at Meghan Markle is not an isolated incident. Black public figures in the UK, from athletes to politicians to musicians, have faced similar treatment. This racism is damaging not just to individual black Britons, but to British society as a whole. It reinforces the idea that some people are more valuable and worthy of respect than others based on their race and ethnicity.

For black Britons, Meghan's decision to step back from royal duties is a powerful statement about the need for greater equality and inclusion in British society. It is a clarion call to recognize the obstacles that black Britons face and to work towards creating a fairer and more inclusive society for everyone. It is also a reminder of the importance of empathy and compassion towards all those who face discrimination and prejudice.

As the UK grapples with the fallout from Brexit and its place in a rapidly changing world, it would do well to listen to the voices of its black citizens. Their experiences and perspectives are a vital part of the British story, and their contributions are essential to creating a truly thriving and successful society. Meghan Markle's decision to step back from royal duties should be seen as a wake-up call not just for the royal family, but for all of Britain.
