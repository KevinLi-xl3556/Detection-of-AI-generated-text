In recent weeks, tensions between the United States and Iran have been escalating. President Donald Trump has threatened military action against Iran, and the Iranian government has responded with threats of their own. However, on Friday, 21st June, President Trump announced that he has backed away from further military conflict with Iran.

This announcement came after one of Iran's unmanned drones was shot down by the United States. After the incident, President Trump stated that he had authorized a military strike against Iran but then abruptly called it off. In an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press," the President explained his reasoning, stating that he did not want to escalate the situation further and that he believed it would not have been a proportionate response to the loss of an unmanned drone.

This decision was met with mixed reactions. Some praised President Trump's restraint and de-escalation of tensions. Others criticized him for backing down and not following through with his threats.

Iran's response to the incident has been similarly mixed. Some Iranian officials have declared that they are not seeking war with the United States and that they are open to negotiations. Others have issued fiery rhetoric, warning that any attack on Iran will be met with a strong response.

The situation between the United States and Iran remains tense, with no immediate resolution in sight. However, President Trump's decision to back away from further military action has brought a temporary sense of relief to many who were fearing the worst. It remains to be seen whether further negotiations between the two countries will result in a lasting peace or whether the tension will continue to escalate.
