In a new development following the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max planes, the aircraft’s supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, has announced cutting down on jobs in response to the impact on its business.

The announcement comes as Boeing's 737 Max planes have remained grounded since March, following two fatal crashes in less than six months. The crashes, which occurred in Ethiopia and Indonesia, claimed the lives of a total of 346 people, and have led to heightened scrutiny of Boeing's safety record, with authorities considering potential design flaws.

Spirit AeroSystems, which is a major producer of the 737 Max aircraft’s fuselage, said that it would lay off around 2,800 employees in Kansas due to the ongoing grounding of the planes. The company is one of the largest suppliers to Boeing and has seen its business impacted as a result of the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max.

This news underscores the extent to which the fallout from the Boeing grounding is spreading through the wider aviation industry. Many suppliers and airlines are being affected, with several already announcing financial losses as they have been forced to cancel flights and find alternative aircraft.

The decision by Spirit AeroSystems to lay off so many of its employees is undoubtedly a severe blow to the local community in Kansas, where the company is based. The layoffs are expected to impact workers across all sectors of the company, including engineering, management and operations.

However, it’s not just Spirit AeroSystems that is experiencing the negative impacts of the ongoing Boeing 737 Max grounding. Airlines worldwide have been forced to cancel thousands of flights, costing them billions of dollars in revenue. The situation could become even worse if the grounding extends into 2020 and beyond. In recent weeks, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines both announced that they would extend their cancellations of 737 Max flights through January 5 and January 6, 2020, respectively.

The grounding of the Boeing 737 Max remains unresolved, with the aircraft still awaiting approval from regulatory authorities around the world before it can return to operations. The longer the situation remains unresolved, the more companies are likely to face the difficult decision of whether to cut staff or reduce production.

In conclusion, the announcement by Spirit AeroSystems regarding significant layoffs is another stark reminder of the outsize influence of the Boeing grounding on the wider aviation industry. All eyes will be on Boeing in the coming months as the company works to resolve the safety issues surrounding the 737 Max and get the planes back in operation. Until then, those employed in the aviation supply chain will likely continue to suffer the knock-on effects of this crisis.
