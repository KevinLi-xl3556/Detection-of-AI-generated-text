Opinion | ‘How Much Did Killing Suleimani Cost Us?’

The United States' decision to assassinate Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, has been a controversial one. The move raised questions not only about the legality and morality of targeted killings but also about the strategic implications of the act. But perhaps the most pressing question is one that has yet to be fully answered: how much did killing Suleimani cost us?

The financial cost of the operation is something that has been extensively debated since news of the assassination broke. Estimates vary widely, with some suggesting that the total bill could be anywhere from a few hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars. And while money is certainly a concern, the real cost of the operation goes far beyond mere dollars and cents.

Indeed, the most significant cost of killing Suleimani is likely to be the long-term impact on US national security. Suleimani was a key figure in the Iranian regime, and his death is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the country and the region as a whole. Some experts have suggested that the assassination may have pushed Iran closer to developing nuclear weapons, while others fear that it may lead to a wider war in the Middle East.

But the impact of the decision to kill Suleimani goes beyond the immediate aftermath of the operation. It also raises questions about the United States' broader foreign policy objectives. Is this a new strategy aimed at regime change in Iran? Or is it a one-off action aimed at sending a message to Iran and other countries that the United States will not tolerate threats to its interests?

Whatever the answer, there's no denying that the decision to kill Suleimani has raised serious questions about the United States' role in the world. Critics argue that it sends a message that targeted killings are an acceptable form of foreign policy, and that the United States is willing to use military force to achieve its goals. Others suggest that the decision is in line with broader US policy in the region, which has sought to assert its hegemony over the Middle East since the end of the Cold War.

In the end, the cost of killing Suleimani is likely to be measured not just in terms of financial resources but also in terms of the United States' global standing. The move has sparked protests across the world, with many questioning not only the legality of targeted killings but also the wisdom of such actions. And while the long-term implications of the move are difficult to predict, it's clear that the United States has taken a significant step with far-reaching consequences.
