Jack Garfein, a celebrated director from the golden age of the Actors Studio, has passed away at the age of 89. The director, who worked with some of the most prominent actors of his time including James Dean, Ben Gazzara, and Marilyn Monroe, died on December 22, 2021 in Los Angeles.

Garfein was known for his rigorous approach to acting and directing, which he learned during his time studying with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York City. He was a founding member of the Studio along with Marlon Brando and other acting legends, and was a prominent figure in its heyday of the 1950s and 60s.

Garfein was born in Czechoslovakia in 1930 and survived Nazi persecution as a Jew during World War II. He came to the United States in the late 1940s and began his career as an actor, appearing in a number of Broadway productions. However, it was as a director that he found his true calling.

He made his directorial debut with "The Strange One," a film based on his own experiences at a military academy, which was released in 1957. The film starred Ben Gazzara and marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between the two.

Garfein also directed the acclaimed film "Something Wild" in 1961, which starred Carroll Baker and Ralph Meeker. The film explored themes of trauma and recovery, and was praised for its inventive visual style and complex characters.

In addition to his work in film, Garfein was also an influential figure in the theater world. He directed a number of productions on and off-Broadway, including the Tony Award-winning play "The Connection" in 1959.

Garfein's legacy as a director and mentor to actors is still felt today. Many of his former students, including Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel, went on to become icons of American cinema.

In a statement released after Garfein's death, the Actors Studio said: "We have lost an extraordinary artist, teacher, and man whose passion for acting was unequaled. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him."

Garfein's passing marks the end of an era in American cinema and theater, but his influence will continue to be felt for generations to come. He leaves behind a rich legacy of groundbreaking work and an enduring commitment to the craft of acting and directing.
