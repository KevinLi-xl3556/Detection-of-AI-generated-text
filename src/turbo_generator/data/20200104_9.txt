President Trump’s decision to authorize the killing of Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, has already caused immense consequences – and not just in Iran. The move has escalated tensions in the Middle East to levels unseen in decades, with many experts fearing that it could lead to a wider and more devastating war.

For years, Suleimani has been the mastermind behind Iran’s proxy forces across the Middle East, including in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. He was responsible for countless attacks on American soldiers, diplomats, and interests, as well as on civilians and non-governmental organizations. In recent years, he had also been instrumental in helping Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria to survive the civil war and regain control over the country.

There is no doubt that Suleimani was a dangerous figure who deserved to face justice for his crimes. However, the question is whether his killing was the right decision at this time and in this way. Trump’s administration has argued that the strike was necessary to prevent an imminent attack on American forces in Iraq or elsewhere. However, there is little evidence to support this claim, and there are concerns that the administration is using it as a pretext for a broader military campaign against Iran.

The consequences of the Suleimani strike have already been severe. Iran has vowed to retaliate against the United States, and it has already launched missile attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq. While no American casualties have been reported so far, the attacks have demonstrated Iran’s ability to strike back at American forces, and they have raised fears of a wider conflict.

Moreover, the strike has also set off a new round of tensions between the United States and its allies in the region, including Iraq. The Iraqi parliament has already passed a resolution calling for the expulsion of American troops from the country, which would be a major setback for U.S. interests in the region. It could also lead to the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which could further destabilize the country and the region.

In the longer term, the Suleimani strike could also have strategic implications for American foreign policy. It has further eroded America’s credibility as a reliable partner and mediator in the Middle East. It has alienated key allies in Europe and the region, who had been trying to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and prevent a wider conflict. It has also emboldened Iran to escalate its own aggressive posture in the region, and to seek new alliances with Russia and China.

In conclusion, the Suleimani strike was a risky and consequential decision by the Trump administration. While it may have taken out a dangerous figure, it has also created new risks and uncertainties in the region, and it could lead to a wider and more devastating conflict. At a time when the world needs more diplomacy and dialogue, the Suleimani decision has pushed us closer to an unnecessary and avoidable war. We can only hope that cooler heads will prevail, and that we can find a way to de-escalate this crisis before it spirals out of control.
