The delay was necessary due to Covid-19 protocols and the need to ensure the safety of players and staff. However, it has had a knock-on effect on players and coaches, who have had to adjust their schedules and training plans accordingly. Some have expressed concern that the extended season could lead to player burnout and increased risk of injury.

Despite these concerns, there is no denying the anticipation for the game. The two teams that have earned their place in the National Championship are Ohio State and Alabama, both of whom have had standout seasons. Fans are eagerly looking forward to seeing these two powerhouse programs face off and determine who will be crowned national champions.

In addition to the matchup between the two teams, the National Championship Game always features exciting pregame and halftime events. These events are aimed at bringing together fans, families, and football enthusiasts to celebrate the sport and its culture.

Overall, though the delay has caused frustration and uncertainty, the National Championship Game remains one of the most significant events in the world of college football.
