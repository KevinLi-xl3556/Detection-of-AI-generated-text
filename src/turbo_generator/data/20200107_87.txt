Why Are So Many Earthquakes Happening in Puerto Rico?

Puerto Rico is experiencing a seismic crisis with over 1,100 earthquakes recorded since December 28, 2019. The island was hit with a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on December 28 and since then, it has been hit with several more including a magnitude 6.4 on January 7, 2020. These earthquakes have caused major damage to infrastructure, shifted land masses and have left thousands of residents without power, water and shelter.

So, why is Puerto Rico experiencing so many earthquakes? The answer lies in the island's location within the Caribbean plate. The Caribbean is a tectonic plate that is moving eastward at a rate of about 2 centimeters per year. Puerto Rico is located near the boundary of two major plates, the Caribbean plate and the North American plate, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.

In addition to the island's location, the geology of the region also plays a significant role in the earthquake activity. The tectonic activity of the region causes the Caribbean plate to subduct, or slide underneath, the North American plate. This creates a seismic zone where the plates are locked and pressure builds up until it is released in the form of an earthquake. This seismic zone, known as the Puerto Rico Trench, runs from the northeast coast of the island past the Dominican Republic.

The recent earthquakes in Puerto Rico have been caused by a series of faults that have ruptured, releasing stress on the plates. Researchers have identified two main faults that have been the source of the recent earthquakes. One fault runs along the southern coast of the island and the other is located just northwest of the island.

The seismic activity in Puerto Rico is not a new phenomenon. The island has a long history of earthquakes and has been hit with several devastating earthquakes in the past. However, the recent frequency and magnitude of the earthquakes have raised concerns about the island's infrastructure, which was already impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2017.

The Puerto Rican government has activated the National Guard to support local emergency operations and has requested federal aid to help with recovery efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved federal aid for emergency response in Puerto Rico and is working with local officials to assess the damage caused by the earthquakes.

In conclusion, Puerto Rico's location within the Caribbean plate and the geology of the region make it vulnerable to earthquake activity. While this is not a new phenomenon, the recent earthquake activity highlights the need for improved infrastructure and emergency management in order to better prepare for future earthquakes. It is important for both local and federal officials to work together to ensure the safety and well-being of Puerto Rico's residents in the face of these ongoing earthquakes.
