As the capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo is a cultural hub with a rich history that spans over 500 years. With its cobblestone streets, colorful buildings, and eclectic mix of colonial and modern architecture, it is no wonder that the city has been listed as one of the top destinations to visit in 2020.

If you happen to have just 36 hours in Santo Domingo, The New York Times has curated a list of things to do and places to check out to ensure you get the most out of your trip.

Day 1:

Start your day by exploring the Zona Colonial, the historic center of Santo Domingo. Visit the Alcazar de Colón, which was once home to Christopher Columbus's son, Diego, and his family. Wander around the picturesque Parque Colón and take in the impressive Catedral Primada de América, the first cathedral in the New World.

Next, stop by El Conde, a popular pedestrian street full of shops, restaurants, and street vendors. Enjoy lunch and sample some authentic Dominican cuisine at El Conuco, a local favorite. Be sure to try the mofongo, a dish made with mashed plantains and meat.

After lunch, head to the Plaza de España and take a stroll down the Malecón, the city's waterfront promenade. Make a pit stop at the historical lighthouse and museum Faro a Colón before watching the sunset at the Marina de Santo Domingo.

For dinner, indulge in some seafood at Adrian Tropical, a popular open-air restaurant located near the beach. Try their famous shrimp and garlic dish.

Day 2:

Begin your second day with a visit to the National Palace and the National Botanical Garden. The palace is the official residence of the President of the Dominican Republic, and the botanical garden is home to over 300 species of plants and stunning botanical displays.

For lunch, head to Mercado Modelo and explore the vibrant marketplace filled with souvenirs and artisan crafts. Grab a bite to eat at one of the many food stalls that serve traditional Dominican cuisine such as sancocho and chicharrones.

In the afternoon, check out the National Museum of History and Geography, which offers a fascinating insight into the country's storied past. Afterwards, take a 20-minute drive to Los Tres Ojos, a group of natural limestone caves with crystal clear water, subterranean lakes, and lush vegetation.

End your trip on a high note with a dinner at Laurel, a modern restaurant that serves up Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Sip on some wine, and enjoy the stunning views of the city skyline.

Although 36 hours may not seem like enough time to explore all that Santo Domingo has to offer, the itinerary provided by The New York Times offers an excellent starting point for any traveler looking to experience the vibrancy and rich history of this beautiful city.
