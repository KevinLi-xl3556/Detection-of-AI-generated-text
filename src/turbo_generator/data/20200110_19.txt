Black Britons Wonder What Took Harry and Meghan so Long

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step back as senior members of the British royal family has raised a lot of questions and sparked debates across the world. However, for black Britons, this move came as a relief and a long-awaited gesture of inclusivity that has been missing from the royal family for too long.

Despite being one of the most powerful and influential institutions in the United Kingdom, the royal family has had a long-standing issue with diversity and inclusiveness. For years, black Britons have felt sidelined, and at times outright excluded, from the monarchy's traditional and elitist ways. This is evidenced by the fact that Meghan Markle, the first mixed-race member of the royal family, faced overt racism and discrimination by both the media and the British public.

The negative treatment of Meghan Markle by the British media was well-documented even before she married Prince Harry. Right from the very beginning, there were articles that questioned her heritage and criticised her for being an outsider to the royal family. As she became more prominent in the royal family, the scrutiny from the media only intensified. This led to speculation that the rumoured rift between Prince William and Prince Harry might be due to William's concern over the effect that Meghan was having on the royal family's reputation.

However, Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from their royal duties has been seen by many black Britons as a powerful statement of change within the monarchy. For too long, black Britons have felt excluded from the royal family, and the couple's decision is a much-welcomed effort to break down old-fashioned barriers and embrace inclusivity.

The fact that the couple now intends to channel their energies into contributing to the greater good through philanthropy and charitable work is a positive step in showing that they are committed to making a real difference. Their focus on issues such as mental health, women's empowerment and environmental sustainability also shows their dedication to issues that matter to a diverse array of people, including those from marginalized communities.

Ultimately, the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to step back as senior members of the royal family has helped to highlight the challenges faced by black Britons within the British royal family. It has also begun a conversation about how to move forward and create an inclusive and diverse monarchy. This is something that black Britons have wished for, for a long time, and while it may have taken the royal family an awfully long time to get there, it's a step in the right direction that is welcomed by all.
