Opinion | Why Is Mitch McConnell So Afraid of John Bolton?

John Bolton can't seem to catch a break. Despite having a career in politics that stretches back decades, and an impressive resume that includes stints as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations and National Security Advisor to Donald Trump, Bolton is still being dismissed by some of the most senior figures in the Republican Party. One of those figures is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been conspicuously silent on Bolton's recent allegations against the president he once worked for.

Bolton's explosive claims that Donald Trump was eager to use military aid to Ukraine as leverage to investigate his political rivals have renewed calls for a Senate trial to remove the president from office. Bolton, who has offered to testify in the impeachment trial, represents an undeniable threat to Trump's grip on the Republican Party. But it's Mitch McConnell who appears to be most anxious about the former national security advisor.

So why is McConnell so afraid of Bolton? The answer is simple: power. As Senate Majority Leader, McConnell is one of the most powerful Republicans in the country. He controls the Senate's legislative agenda, decides what bills come to the floor for a vote and has the power to block or approve nominations for federal judges and executive branch officials. By all accounts, McConnell is the most powerful man in the Senate.

But his power is not absolute. In fact, it's entirely dependent on the loyalty of his caucus. McConnell's control over the Senate rests on the whims of a group of senators who are increasingly restless under his leadership. Senators like Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitt Romney have already shown themselves to be willing to break with the party line, causing McConnell to scramble to maintain his grip on power.

Bolton, with his vast network of contacts in the Republican Party, could easily tip the scales against McConnell. If Bolton testifies in the Senate trial, he could provide damning evidence against Trump that would make it impossible for the Senate to acquit the president. That would be a major blow to McConnell's power, and could even lead to his ouster as Senate Majority Leader.

Given the stakes, it's no wonder that McConnell is so anxious about Bolton's potential testimony. But in trying to prevent that testimony from happening, McConnell is revealing something much deeper: a profound fear of accountability. Rather than engage with the evidence presented against the president, McConnell is trying to stifle it, hoping that the American people will simply forget about the allegations against Trump and move on.

It's a strategy that worked in the past, but it may not work this time. The American people are getting restless, and they're demanding accountability from their elected officials. As the impeachment trial heats up, McConnell will have to choose between protecting his own power or upholding his oath of office to defend the Constitution. The latter requires him to conduct an honest and thorough trial, free of politics and partisanship. Will he have the courage to do what's right, or will he succumb to the pressure to protect his own political fortunes? Only time will tell.
