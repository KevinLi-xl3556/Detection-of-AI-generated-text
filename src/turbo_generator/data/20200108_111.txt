In China, loyalty to the Communist Party and its leaders has always been strongly emphasized. This was evident at the annual Qingming Festival, a time of mourning for the dead, celebrated last month. At a "sacred" lake in central China, thousands gathered to pay their respects to ancestors and declared their love for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party.

The location of the gathering, the Chunxiu Tianxia Resort in Henan Province, is believed to have spiritual significance, with some claiming it is a portal to the underworld. But on April 4, it was filled with people waving Chinese flags, singing patriotic songs, and shouting slogans in support of Xi and the Party.

This spectacle was not an isolated incident. The Chinese government has been increasingly promoting Xi Jinping's cult of personality and pushing for greater loyalty to the Communist Party. This has been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent and a tightening of controls on the media and internet.

At the same time, the Chinese government has been gaining international influence through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. China is also becoming more assertive in its territorial claims in the South China Sea and elsewhere.

For many Chinese, the message is clear: loyalty to the Communist Party and its leader is essential for the unity and prosperity of the nation. However, many worry that this emphasis on loyalty above all else stifles dissent and undermines democracy.

As one participant at the Chunxiu Tianxia Resort put it, "Loving the Party and loving the country are one and the same thing." But whether this sentiment will bring greater unity or greater division in the long run remains to be seen.
