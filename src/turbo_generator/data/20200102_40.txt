Former Vice President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he had raised $22.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an impressive amount that highlights his broad support among donors across the country. The total amount raised by Mr. Biden in the past year is $76 million, putting him in a strong position heading into the critical Iowa caucuses next month.

The announcement is a significant boost to Mr. Biden’s campaign, which has struggled in recent polls against rivals including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. While he has consistently polled as a front-runner, Mr. Biden has often been criticized by progressives for his centrist record and ties to the establishment.

Despite these challenges, Mr. Biden has remained focused on building a broad coalition of supporters and donors, and the latest fundraising numbers suggest that this strategy is working. In a statement to supporters, he thanked his team and pledged to use the funds to help build a stronger, more inclusive country.

“This campaign is about restoring the soul of America, and we’re doing it together,” he said. “The support we’ve received from people across the country reflects a deep desire to move past the divisiveness and anger that has defined our politics for too long.”

Critics, however, have pointed to the outsized influence of wealthy donors in politics, and some have accused Mr. Biden of cozying up to the rich and powerful. Indeed, almost all of his campaign’s donations come from individuals who have given the maximum allowed by law, a fact that has raised concerns among some progressives.

Mr. Biden’s fundraising success also comes as his campaign has faced mounting criticism over his record on issues like climate change and criminal justice reform. Citing his support for the Iraq War and his role in crafting the controversial 1994 crime bill, some progressives have accused him of being out of step with the party’s values.

Despite these criticisms, however, Mr. Biden remains a formidable candidate with strong support among African Americans and other key voting blocs. With the Iowa caucuses just weeks away, his latest fundraising numbers are likely to further bolster his campaign’s chances of success.
