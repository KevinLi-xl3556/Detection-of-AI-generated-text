Venus, the sister planet of Earth, is a hot and hostile world with a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulphuric acid clouds. Despite its extreme conditions, scientists have discovered that the planet may have active volcanoes that are still emitting smoke and ash.

This surprising discovery was made using observations from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which explored Venus’s atmosphere from 2006 to 2014. The spacecraft detected a significant increase in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas in the atmosphere above certain areas of the planet’s surface.

Sulphur dioxide is a gas that is commonly associated with volcanic eruptions on Earth. It is produced when magma rises to the surface and releases gas from the molten rock. Once in the atmosphere, sulphur dioxide can spread and react with other molecules to form sulphuric acid clouds, which can reflect sunlight and cool the planet’s surface.

The fact that Venus has sulphur dioxide in its atmosphere could be a strong indication of ongoing volcanic activity on the planet. While Venus has long been known to have volcanoes, the idea of recent eruptions has largely been considered unlikely due to the planet’s extreme conditions. Venus has a surface temperature of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead – and an atmospheric pressure more than 90 times that of Earth.

However, the new observation of sulphur dioxide suggests that the planet’s volcanoes may indeed be active. The scientists behind the research believe that the volcanic activity on Venus could help explain some of the planet’s other mysteries, such as how it has managed to maintain a relatively stable temperature despite its proximity to the sun.

Further research is needed to confirm whether the sulphur dioxide detected by the Venus Express spacecraft is indeed coming from active volcanoes, or if there could be other explanations for its presence in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the discovery is a fascinating reminder of the volatile and dynamic nature of our neighboring planets in the solar system. 

In conclusion, this is an interesting discovery that could lead to more knowledge about our neighboring planet Venus. Apart from being a hot and harsh planet, it could be home to active volcanoes, which is something worth exploring and studying. The implications of this discovery could be massive in understanding the history of the planet and its dynamics, and it would not come as a surprise if future missions were directed towards this discovery.
