As the world moves towards the end of the week, there are a few key topics that are taking shape in the news. The New York Times' Thursday Evening Briefing highlights three of the most important ones - Iran, impeachment and the 52 places to go.

Iran continues to be a hot topic, with tensions between the US and Iran continuing to rise. The US State Department has ordered the departure of non-emergency personnel from Iraq, citing the threat posed by Iranian-backed militias. Meanwhile, Iran has announced that it will be reducing its commitments to the international nuclear deal, citing the failure of the other signatories to provide the economic benefits promised under the agreement.

The issue of impeachment is also continuing to dominate the news cycle. Democrats in the House of Representatives are pushing forward with their investigations into President Trump's alleged involvement in the Ukraine scandal, which could ultimately result in his removal from office. Trump, for his part, is continuing to fight back against the investigations, claiming that they are politically motivated and lacking in substance.

Finally, the New York Times' Thursday Evening Briefing also highlights the 52 places to go, an annual list of must-see destinations around the world. This year's list includes destinations such as Egypt, Colorado and Mongolia, and is designed to inspire people to travel and explore new places.

Overall, Thursday evening's news highlights the ongoing tensions between the US and Iran, the potential impeachment of President Trump, and the joys of travel and exploration. As the world continues to spin, it's important to stay informed and engaged with the issues that matter most.
