On December 22nd, 2017, a new law was passed by Congress that significantly expanded the uses for 529 college savings accounts. These accounts were originally created in 1996 to help parents save for their child's college education, but the new law now allows for funds to be used for a wider range of education expenses.

One of the most notable changes is that money in a 529 account can now be used to pay for tuition expenses for K-12 education, as well as expenses for apprenticeships and other forms of job training. This not only provides families with flexibility when saving for education, but can also help promote workforce development and skills training.

Another change is that funds in a 529 account can now be rolled over into an ABLE account, which is designed to help individuals with disabilities save for expenses related to their disability. This makes it easier for families to plan and save for both their child's education and any potential disability-related expenses they may incur.

Additionally, the maximum contribution limit for 529 accounts has been increased from $14,000 to $15,000 per year for each beneficiary. This means families can contribute more money to their child's account each year, helping them reach their savings goals faster.

While these changes may not have a significant impact on every family, they do provide added options and flexibility for those saving for education expenses. It's important to note, however, that each state has its own 529 plan with its own unique features and benefits, so families should research and compare plans to find the one that best fits their needs.

Overall, the expansion of 529 account uses is a positive step towards making education more accessible and affordable for families across the US. It allows for families to have a greater choice in how they save for education and can help set the foundation for a bright future.
