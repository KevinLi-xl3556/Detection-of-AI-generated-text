Liz Moore’s ‘Long Bright River’ is a haunting and beautiful novel that explores the complexities of family and addiction in a gritty urban setting.

The story follows two sisters, Kacey and Mickey, who grew up in a tough Philadelphia neighborhood but ended up on opposite sides of the law. Kacey is a drug addict and sex worker, while Mickey is a police officer determined to clean up the streets where her sister lives.

In this excerpt, we learn about their childhood and the bond that once connected them.

The air in Kensington smelled of coal and blood. It was perpetual, the smell: factories and slaughterhouses that were always encouraging the growth of things like tuberculosis, and in winter, the smoke from fires the residents stoked in their stoves to keep at bay the cold that seeped through the walls of their poorly insulated homes. In summer it was the smell of feces and tar, of fish and shrimp that washed up on the muddy banks of the Delaware in the eastern part of the city, where the river became a harbor. The smell of the city was not something to be escaped, but something to be breathed, appreciated for its familiarity.

Mickey and Kacey McKenna had been breathing the Kensington air since they were born: sharp puffs of cold in winter, dusty wafts in summer. It was all they knew; it was home. They knew the joy of jumping over puddles that collected after a rain or finding a penny on the sidewalk. They knew the comfort of being outside in the summer at dusk, when the day’s heat began to dissipate and the scent of charcoal-grilled meat would ride a breeze. But they also knew the long, sudden silences. The fear they could feel deep in their bones. The scars that etched their neighborhood, as familiar as their own faces.

They shared a red brick rowhouse with their mother, who lived off child support from their father and the occasional alimony check when he hadn’t been to jail in a while. Their mother spent weekends at the bars and weeknights in her bed. She didn’t work, not officially. She sold pills from the front porch of their house and let men come and go from her room. The McKenna sisters referred to them as ‘‘uncles,’’ but these men were not their family. They were crack dealers and addicts, the man who repaired things around the house for a fee, sometimes half-drunk before noon.

Despite their mother’s presence, Mickey and Kacey were each other’s support system. They were two years apart and the age differences showed in the way they dressed and talked, but not in how they related to each other. As a kid, Mickey saw herself as Kacey’s caretaker, the one who smoothed down her hair and held her when she cried at night. But as they grew older, Kacey began to assume a protective mantle, watching out for her older sister when she was around their mother’s sketchy friends. In their teens, their bond grew rock-solid. It was them against the world. It was them against their circumstances.

Liz Moore masterfully weaves together the present-day search for a serial killer with the sisters’ memories of their childhood, creating a deeply emotional and compelling narrative. ‘Long Bright River’ is a testament to the resilience of sisterhood and the power of love to overcome even the toughest of obstacles.

The novel is available now and is a must-read for fans of literary fiction and crime novels alike.
