As a writer, I am obliged to inform my readership on the issues pertaining to the human mind, and one such issue is that of office treats. For most people, office treats are a welcome distraction, a momentary relief from the daily drudgery that is office work. However, in many cases, office treats bring out the worst of humanity. Yes, they lead to unnecessary competition, jealousy, and resentment in the workplace.

It may seem innocuous to bring in a tray of cupcakes or a box of donuts to share with coworkers, but it's not. Once the treats are on the scene, the game is on. Some people will feel compelled to take more than their fair share, even if it means someone else will miss out. Others will engage in blatant favoritism, giving treats to their favorite colleagues while leaving others out in the cold. And don't even get me started on the guilt tripping. "Come on, have another cookie, it's just one cookie, you deserve it!" says the colleague who has already had four.

The worst part is the unspoken expectation that everyone should participate in the office treat circus. If you decline the offer of a cupcake, you'll be met with incredulity, if not outright suspicion. "What's wrong with you?" your coworkers will ask. "Why don't you like cupcakes?" Suddenly, your refusal to partake in the sugar frenzy is a personal affront, and you're left feeling like you've committed some unforgivable sin.

So, why do office treats have this effect on people? It's simple: scarcity. When there's a limited supply of something valuable, people will fight over it. It's basic psychology. And in the office, where people are vying for promotions, recognition or even just a chance to get ahead, every little advantage counts. A cupcake can mean the difference between being noticed and being overlooked.

In conclusion, office treats may seem like a harmless way to bond with coworkers, but they can also bring out the worst in us. Instead of creating a sense of community, they can breed competition, jealousy, and resentment, making the workplace a more toxic environment. So next time you're tempted to bring a box of donuts to work, think twice. You may just be sowing the seeds of discord.
