Peter Kirstein, a renowned British computer scientist who was instrumental in launching the internet in Europe, passed away on June 8, 2021 at the age of 86. His contributions to the world of technology have had an immeasurable impact on the way we communicate, conduct business, and obtain information today.

Born in Germany in 1933, Kirstein’s family fled to England to escape Nazi persecution when he was just five years old. He went on to study electrical engineering and computer science at the University of London, where he received his Ph.D. in 1964.

Kirstein's legacy began in the early 1970s when he was approached by the British government to help develop a computer network that would allow research institutions across Europe to share data and collaborate more effectively. This network, known as the European Academic Research Network (EARN), was one of the earliest forms of what we now know as the internet.

Kirstein continued to lead the charge in developing and expanding computer networks throughout Europe, and in 1984 he helped to create the first European connection to the U.S. internet. He also played a key role in establishing the Internet Activities Board (IAB), which was responsible for setting internet standards and protocols.

In addition to his work in the field of computer science, Kirstein was also a passionate advocate for civil liberties and human rights. He was a member of Amnesty International and served as a trustee of the human rights organization Article 19.

Kirstein’s contributions to the development of the internet and his commitment to social justice have had a lasting impact on both the way we communicate and the way we view our role in the world. His work paved the way for a more connected and collaborative world, and his passion for human rights serves as a reminder of the importance of using technology for the greater good. 

Peter Kirstein may no longer be with us, but his legacy will continue to shape our technological landscape for generations to come.
