Recently, an airstrike by the United States on Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani has pushed national security to the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. With tensions escalating in the Middle East and the possibility of further military action, voters are looking to candidates who can provide a sense of security and stability.

The candidates have had varying responses to the airstrike. Democratic candidates have largely criticized President Trump's decision and emphasized the need for diplomatic solutions, while Republican candidates have supported the move and emphasized the need to protect American interests.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has extensive foreign policy experience, has been emphasizing his record of handling international crises and working with allies. Bernie Sanders has been focusing on his opposition to the Iraq War and advocating for a strong stance against Saudi Arabia, which he sees as a destabilizing force in the region.

President Trump, on the other hand, has been emphasizing his administration's tough stance on Iran, including withdrawing from the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions. He has also been touting his record on national security, including the killing of Soleimani.

As the Democratic primaries heat up, voters are likely to focus even more on candidates' positions on national security. While domestic issues such as healthcare and the economy are important, the recent events in the Middle East have reminded Americans of the importance of a strong and stable foreign policy. 

Furthermore, recent cyber attacks on the U.S. by foreign actors add to the national security concerns, placing the election's national security discourse under a microscope. That, among other matters of international importance, will factor on voter's minds in the voting booths.

Overall, the 2020 race is shaping up to be a referendum on not only President Trump but also U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond. The candidates who can provide a clear and strong vision for national security are likely to be the ones who resonate most with voters come November.
