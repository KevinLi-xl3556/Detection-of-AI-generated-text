The recent assassination of Qassim Suleimani, one of Iran’s most senior military commanders, has sent shockwaves across the Middle East and the world at large. The drone strike authorized by President Trump has seemingly extricated the United States from a dangerous situation, but in reality, it has unleashed a wave of chaos that will have a long-lasting impact on the region.

Suleimani was a revered figure in Iran and was widely regarded as the architect of its foreign policy. He played a significant role in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, where his Quds Force was responsible for supporting the Shia militias that fought against the Islamic State. His death has unified the Iranian people, who regard him as a martyr, and has united the country behind the government that many had previously criticized.

The Iraqi parliament also passed a resolution calling for the expulsion of all foreign troops from the country, including the thousands of American soldiers currently stationed there. The Iranian government has pledged to retaliate against the United States and its allies, raising the specter of another war in the Middle East.

The assassination of Suleimani has also undermined the fragile stability of the region. Iraq, already torn apart by sectarian strife, now faces the prospect of a renewed civil war as the Shia militias that he supported demand revenge. The Syrian conflict, which he played a significant role in, is likely to escalate further as Iran seeks to avenge his death. And Yemen, already the site of a brutal war, may now see an increase in Iranian support for the Houthi rebels.

All of this is to say that the killing of Suleimani is a dangerous and reckless move that will have far-reaching consequences. In addition to the immediate impact, it will also have long-term ramifications. Iran is unlikely to forget this incident anytime soon, and it will undoubtedly seek revenge in some form or another. The United States, already embroiled in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, may now be drawn into yet another war in the Middle East.

The assassination of Qassim Suleimani was a drastic escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran, and it will undoubtedly have severe consequences. In an era in which diplomacy is increasingly crucial, this act of violence will only serve to further destabilize the region and threaten the lives of countless innocent civilians. It’s a terrible decision that I’m afraid will haunt us for years to come.
