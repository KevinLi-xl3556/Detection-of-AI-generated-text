As the time for Taiwan’s presidential election draws near, the world is watching with keen interest. Set to take place on January 11, 2020, the election promises to be hotly contested.

Here are some key points to keep in mind as Taiwan prepares for this significant political event.

The Candidates:

There are three main candidates running for president in the upcoming election. Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is seeking re-election. Her main rival is Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, who is known for his populist style and rhetoric. The third candidate is James Soong from the People First Party.

Tsai Ing-wen, who has been president since 2016, is the first female president of Taiwan. She is known for her firm stance on the island’s independence from China and has been criticized by Beijing for her refusal to acknowledge the “One China” policy.

Han Kuo-yu, on the other hand, advocates for closer ties with China and has been critical of Tsai’s approach towards Beijing. He gained public attention after winning a surprise victory in the mayoral election for Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second-largest city, last year.

Key Issues:

One of the central issues in the election is cross-Strait relations, with opinions divided on whether Taiwan should maintain its independence or reunite with China. Tsai’s DPP has taken a defiant stance against Beijing’s attempts to pressure Taiwan into reunification, while Han has adopted a more conciliatory approach towards China.

Another major issue in the election is the economy. While Taiwan has enjoyed a robust economic growth in recent years, there are concerns about rising income inequality and the impact of the US-China trade war.

The Outcome:

The race for Taiwan’s presidency is expected to be a close one, with no clear front-runner. Opinion polls conducted in December showed Tsai leading by a small margin, but her lead has narrowed in recent weeks.

The outcome of the election could have significant implications not only for Taiwan but also for the wider region. A Tsai victory could indicate a continuation of the current administration’s approach to cross-Strait relations and its stance on Taiwan’s independence. A Han victory, on the other hand, could signal a shift towards closer ties with China and a potential reunification down the line.

Conclusion:

The upcoming Taiwan presidential election is one of the most important political events in the region this year. With the candidates divided on key issues such as cross-Strait relations and the economy, the outcome of the election could have far-reaching implications for Taiwan and the region. All eyes will be on Taiwan as the country prepares to elect its next leader on January 11.
