In recent years, the Trump administration has been aggressive in its criticism of China, particularly when it comes to human rights abuses and trade practices. However, the White House's actions in the Middle East have come under scrutiny for complicating its criticisms of China.

The administration's policies towards Iran, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia have raised concerns over the inconsistency of its foreign policies. The administration's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and its subsequent re-imposition of sanctions against Iran have created instability in the Middle East, particularly in the form of heightened tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The ongoing conflict in Yemen, which the United States supports Saudi Arabia in, has led to a humanitarian crisis and has been criticized by international human rights groups.

These actions have led critics to question the Trump administration's commitment to human rights and democracy, which the administration has often cited as reasons for its criticisms of China. They argue that the administration cannot legitimately criticize China for its human rights abuses while at the same time supporting governments that commit similar abuses.

The administration's apparent prioritization of its strategic interests in the Middle East over its human rights concerns has also led some to question the sincerity of its criticisms of China. The administration has been accused of using human rights as a tool to advance its own interests, rather than as a genuine effort to promote democracy and human rights.

Furthermore, the administration's policies in the Middle East have negative implications for its relationship with China. The United States' aggressive stance towards Iran has led China to increase its investments in Iran's energy sector, which could put China in conflict with the United States' sanctions against Iran. Additionally, the conflict in Yemen has led to increased tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which in turn has implications for China's economic and strategic interests in the region.

The Trump administration's actions in the Middle East have complicated its criticisms of China and have raised concerns over the consistency and sincerity of its foreign policies. Critics argue that the administration cannot legitimately criticize China for its human rights abuses while simultaneously supporting governments that commit similar abuses. This inconsistency could have negative implications for the United States' relationship with China and for global human rights and democracy.
