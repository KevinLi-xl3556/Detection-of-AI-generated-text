Conflict With Iran Threatens Fight Against ISIS

As tensions rise between the United States and Iran, the shared goal of defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria seems increasingly endangered. The recent killing of Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian military commander, by an American drone strike in Iraq, prompted Iran to launch missile strikes on U.S. military bases in Iraq and retaliate against Iraqi bases housing American troops that reportedly killed no Americans but injured several U.S. soldiers. While both countries have signaled a desire to avoid further escalation, the risk of miscalculation or miscommunication looms large, as does the danger of a wider regional conflict that could engulf Iraq and other neighbors of Iran and the United States. In the meantime, the fight against ISIS, which has been weakened but not defeated, risks losing momentum and support.

The United States and its allies have worked with local forces in Iraq and Syria to degrade and dismantle the self-proclaimed caliphate that ISIS established in 2014. After years of fierce battles that led to the loss of thousands of lives, the international coalition has claimed significant territorial gains, killed many of the group's leaders, and disrupted its financing, propaganda, and recruitment. However, ISIS remains a dangerous and adaptive movement that still controls some territory in Syria, infiltrates and inspires cells in Iraq and other countries, and poses a threat to stability and security in the region and beyond. Moreover, the recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from parts of Syria, following a phone call between President Trump and President Erdogan of Turkey, has emboldened Turkey and Russia to expand their influence there and raised concerns about the fate of Kurdish allies who fought ISIS and may now face Turkish attacks or Syrian regime takeover.

The Iranian government, despite its animosity toward the United States and some of its allies, has also opposed ISIS and played a role in the fight against it. Iran has supported the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, which has battled ISIS and other rebel groups, and backed Shiite militias in Iraq that have fought both ISIS and Sunni extremists who target Iraq's Shiite majority. Iran has also used its influence over the Iraqi government and some of its armed groups to help coordinate the anti-ISIS campaign and supply weapons and training. However, Iran's involvement in Iraq and Syria has often clashed with the U.S. and its regional allies' interests and led to accusations of Iranian interference, destabilization, and human rights abuses. The Trump administration has pursued a policy of maximum pressure on Iran, including crippling economic sanctions and military threats, in order to force Iran to change its behavior or collapse its regime. While such a policy may have reinforced the sanctions regime and deterred some Iranian actions, it has also raised the risk of a military confrontation or a nuclear arms race.

The killing of Soleimani, who commanded Iran's elite Quds Force and oversaw many of its foreign operations, has escalated the tensions between the United States and Iran to a new level of danger. Iran has vowed to take revenge for his death, which it sees as a major blow to its strategic interests and its reputation as a regional power. The missile strikes against U.S. bases were a bold and symbolic move that showed Iran's ability to hit U.S. forces and to challenge their presence in the Middle East. Iran has also announced that it will no longer abide by the limits on its nuclear program imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal, which the Trump administration withdrew from in 2018, and may pursue a weapon more openly or aggressively. The risk of a further military or covert response from either side, and the potential for miscalculation or escalation, remains high.

The conflict between the United States and Iran threatens not only to disrupt the fight against ISIS, but also to unsettle the fragile balance of power in the region and to trigger a broader conflict that could harm millions of people and destabilize the global economy. The international community, and especially the neighboring countries of Iran and Iraq, must urge both sides to de-escalate and to ensure that their differences are resolved through diplomacy, not violence. The fight against ISIS requires a sustained and coordinated effort that relies on the support and trust of local forces, communities, and governments, and that addresses the root causes of extremism, such as political marginalization, economic deprivation, and sectarian or ethnic tensions. The United States and its allies should not abandon the fight against ISIS or ignore the risks of losing ground or allies, but should also recognize that a comprehensive strategy must involve more than just military force and short-term objectives. The long-term stability and security of the Middle East depend on finding a way to manage the conflicts and the interests of all parties involved, including Iran, without sacrificing the lives and the dignity of the people in the region.
