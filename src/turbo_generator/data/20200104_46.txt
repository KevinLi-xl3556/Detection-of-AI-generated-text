In recent years, the car buying industry has seen an unprecedented boom, driven by a combination of low interest rates, cheap gas prices and consumers comfortable with taking on deeper levels of debt.

This trend comes as no surprise given the historically low interest rates of the past decade. With lenders offering rates as low as 0% for many car loans, buyers have been able to finance larger and more expensive vehicles than ever before. This has fueled the growth of the luxury SUV and truck markets, which have seen sales increase year over year.

Additionally, the decrease in gas prices has provided further incentive for buyers to opt for larger vehicles. The recent shale boom in the United States has caused gas prices to tumble to levels not seen in years, which has caused gas guzzling vehicles to be more affordable to operate.

While it is true that the combination of low rates and cheap gas has been driving sales, it is also important not to overlook the role of increasing levels of debt. Consumer debt reached a record high in 2018, and auto loans account for a significant portion of this increase. With longer loan terms and lower interest rates, it has become easier for consumers to take on more debt in order to purchase a car.

Despite concerns about the impact of rising levels of debt, the car buying boom is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. As lenders continue to offer attractive financing options, and gas prices remain low, it is likely that car buying will continue to be a bright spot in an otherwise uncertain economy.

In conclusion, it is clear that the combination of low interest rates, cheap gas prices, and deeper levels of debt are driving the car buying boom. While this trend may be concerning to some, it is important to recognize the positive impact the industry is having on the economy as a whole. As long as consumers are able to manage their debt responsibly, there is no reason why the car buying boom cannot continue to provide a significant boost to the economy for years to come.
