The entertainment world mourns the loss of one of its greats as Buck Henry passes away at age 89. The writer and actor was a key figure in shaping the comedy landscape of the 1960s and 70s, leaving an indelible mark on television and film with his wit, insight and innovative storytelling skills.

Henry's career as a writer took off in the early 1960s with the creation of "The New Adventures of Huck Finn," a television series that he co-wrote with Mark Twain's biographer Justin Kaplan. He then went on to become an integral part of the production team that created the iconic television show "Get Smart," which aired from 1965 to 1970. Henry co-created the show with Mel Brooks, starring Don Adams as the bumbling spy Maxwell Smart, and it soon became a cultural phenomenon, winning multiple Emmys and earning a devoted following.

Henry's comedic prowess didn't stop at television. He also had a successful career as a screenwriter, contributing to some of the most memorable and thought-provoking films of the era. He co-wrote the screenplay for the classic film "The Graduate," starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, which won him an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. His other notable works include "Heaven Can Wait," "To Die For" and "The Owl and the Pussycat."

As an actor, Henry was equally talented, often appearing in cameo roles in some of his own productions. He was a frequent guest on late-night talk shows, where his wit and charm won over audiences, and he often lent his voice to animated projects.

Henry will be remembered not just for his remarkable talents, but also for breaking down barriers in the entertainment industry. As one of the few openly gay writers in Hollywood, he brought a unique perspective to his work, challenging stereotypes and pushing boundaries.

In the wake of his passing, the entertainment industry, and his legions of fans, will miss him greatly. Buck Henry was a true original, a trailblazer, and a comedic genius. Let us celebrate his life and his contributions to the world of entertainment, and may his legacy continue to inspire aspiring writers and creatives for generations to come.
