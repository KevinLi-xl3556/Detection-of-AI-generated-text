The year 2020 has been quite a rollercoaster ride so far, and students across the world have had to adapt to the sudden changes brought about by the pandemic. The New York Times recently circulated a survey, asking students about their experiences, and here's what some of them had to say.

Growing up in another era: One of the most common responses was that students feel like they are growing up in a completely different era. They miss being able to hang out with friends, participate in school events, and feel like they are a part of something bigger than themselves. But at the same time, students are grateful for technology, which has made it possible to stay connected with friends and family, even from a distance.

Distraction: Another topic that students mentioned was distraction. Online classes, social media, and the constant news cycle have made it difficult for many students to focus on their studies. "It's hard to stay motivated and productive when everything feels so uncertain and chaotic," said one student. Others talked about using apps to block distracting websites or finding ways to create a designated workspace at home.

2020: Students also expressed their frustration with the way 2020 has turned out. From canceled graduations and trips to the uncertainty of what the future holds, students feel like they are missing out on a lot. "2020 has been a major disappointment," said one student. "But I try to focus on the things I can control, like my own actions and attitudes."

Overall, it's clear that students are facing unprecedented challenges in 2020, but they are also finding ways to cope and make the best of the situation. Whether it's connecting with friends virtually, finding ways to stay productive, or simply staying positive in the face of uncertainty, students are proving to be resilient and adaptable in these worrying times.
