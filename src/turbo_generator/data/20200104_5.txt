On the 3rd of January, the United States of America assassinated Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, in an airstrike that has raised tensions between the two countries to new heights. In response, antiwar protesters across the U.S. have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to this violent act.

The New York Times reported on the demonstrations, which have taken place in major cities such as Washington D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The protesters, consisting of a diverse range of individuals and groups, including peace activists, civil rights organizations, and religious groups, have united in their condemnation of the killing of Soleimani.

The demonstrations have been peaceful but passionate, reflecting the concerns and fears of those who fear further escalation between Iran and the U.S. Many protesters argue that the U.S. should not use military force as a first resort, and urge the government to pursue peaceful negotiations.

Some of the protesters also criticize the government's lack of transparency in the decision-making process that led to the airstrike. The New York Times reports that protesters have called for greater accountability and transparency from the government, and demand that Congress be fully consulted before any further military action is taken.

While some Americans have shown their support for President Trump's decision to target Soleimani, the antiwar protesters across the country have made it clear that not all Americans share this view. The demonstrations reflect a deep dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy and a desire for a more peaceful and diplomatic approach.

The killing of Soleimani has raised many questions and concerns, but one thing is clear - it has sparked a new wave of activism and protest across the U.S. Antiwar protesters have come together to voice their opposition to this violent act and demand a more peaceful approach to foreign policy.
