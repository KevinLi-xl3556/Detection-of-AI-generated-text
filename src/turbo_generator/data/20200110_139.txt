The recent New York Times article with the headline "‘This Airplane is Designed by Clowns’" has been creating quite a stir among aviation enthusiasts and industry experts alike. The article, which was written by pilot and writer William Langewiesche, is a scathing critique of the design and development of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which has been involved in two fatal crashes within the past year.

Langewiesche's article argues that the development of the 737 Max was plagued by a complex and convoluted regulatory process, which allowed Boeing engineers to make critical design decisions without adequate oversight or scrutiny. He also suggests that Boeing's focus on maximizing profits led them to cut corners on safety features, ultimately resulting in the two crashes that claimed the lives of 346 people.

The article has been met with mixed reactions from the aviation community. Some have praised Langewiesche for shining a light on the issues with the Max's design and calling out Boeing's questionable business practices. Others have criticized the article for oversimplifying the complex factors that led to the Max crashes, and suggesting that blame lies solely with the aircraft's design.

Regardless of one's perspective on the matter, it is clear that the Max's development was not without its problems. The two fatal crashes that have taken place have led to a worldwide grounding of the Max, and a host of investigations into the aircraft's design and development process.

Moving forward, it is vitally important that the aviation industry takes a hard look at how it can improve aircraft safety, and ensure that the development process is transparent and accountable. The Max crashes have shown that the stakes are simply too high to ignore the critical importance of effective regulation and oversight in aircraft design and development.
