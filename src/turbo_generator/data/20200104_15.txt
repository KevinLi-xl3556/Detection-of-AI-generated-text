A father and daughter were mistakenly shot and killed by a hunter while walking their dogs on a hiking trail in South Carolina on Wednesday. Officials stated that the hunter reportedly mistook them for deer.

Kim Drawdy, 30, and his daughter Lauren, 9, were out on a quiet hike in a rural area when they suddenly found themselves under fire from the aforementioned hunter.

The incident took place near the small town of Walterboro, located in the heart of South Carolina. According to authorities, the hunters involved in the incident are cooperating fully with investigators.

"This is a tragic and preventable loss of life, and our hearts go out to the Drawdy family," said South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Director Alvin Taylor. "We are urging all hunters to exercise extreme caution when out in the field, and to always be certain of their targets before shooting."

The Drawdy family is being mourned by friends and loved ones. Family members have said that Kim and Lauren had a close relationship, and often went hiking together as a way of bonding.

While it is unclear at this time what consequences the hunter responsible for the accidental shooting will face, it is clear that this tragedy is a stark reminder of the importance of gun safety and responsible hunting practices.

As we head into the upcoming hunting season, it is imperative that hunters take the time to review proper protocols, so as to prevent such accidents from happening in the future.

We must remember that hunting, while a time-honored tradition and legitimate source of recreation, should never come at the cost of human life. Our hearts go out to the Drawdy family, and we hope that this tragedy serves as a reminder to all of us that hunting is a responsibility, not a right.
