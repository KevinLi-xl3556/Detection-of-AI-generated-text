As we get drowned in the digital world of images, sculptures still hold a sense of uniqueness and creativity. Sculpture as art form is not new to humanity, they date back to early civilizations where they were used to depict gods, heroes and other cultural icons. But what is it about sculpture that makes it stand out in a world dominated by digital images?

For starters, sculpture is three-dimensional, it occupies physical space and can be admired from various angles. It is not an art in a purely visual form but an expression that people can interact with. It invites the viewer to move around and take a closer view of the work, to see it in different lights or positions. This physical interaction makes sculptures tactile and thus makes it stand out from any digital art form.

Sculpture is an ode to tradition and craftsmanship. They are works of art that show the deep-rooted skills passed down through generations of artists. From carving to casting, the skills involved in creating sculptures are highly technical and require a serious level of precision to create a masterpiece. The very process involved shows the dedication and discipline required to sculpt an artwork cannot be achieved through digital manipulation. Some sculpture works can take weeks, months or even years to complete, the level of dedication is something any virtual art cannot achieve.

Sculptures also express a kind of timelessness. They have a unique way of transcending time, and the aesthetics could be relevant for centuries. From ancient Greek, Roman or Egyptian sculptures, the stories they tell and the emotions they evoke are still relevant to this day. Sculptures are thought-provoking, an impression that stays with us long after viewing the artwork. Digital art is temporary, but sculptures are permanent.

Despite the constant push towards a digital world of images, sculptures still hold a unique prestige that will never be replaced. The talent, craftsmanship, emotion and the physical interaction that sculptures provide, is something that cannot be achieved through any virtual art form. Sculpture is timeless, and the stories they tell will continue to connect people across generations for centuries to come.
