And You Thought Brexit Was Tough …

The United Kingdom's protracted negotiations to leave the European Union have been making headlines for over three years now, but across the pond another political stalemate has been unfolding with its own share of complexities.

The United States government's partial shutdown that began on December 22, 2018, has now entered its 26th day – making it the longest in American history. This shutdown, which affects around 800,000 federal workers who have either been furloughed or are working without pay, stems from a dispute between President Donald Trump and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives over funding for a border wall with Mexico.

The shutdown has resulted in various government agencies functioning at a decreased capacity, with a number of services being affected. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), responsible for airport security, has seen higher rates of TSA agents calling in sick, causing long queues and flight delays. National parks have been closed, and many parks have seen unprecedented levels of trash accumulation and vandalism. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is not processing paper tax returns, and federal courts have been impacted as well.

But perhaps the most concerning consequence of the shutdown is the psychological toll it is taking on federal workers and their families. With no end in sight, many are worried about how to make ends meet as they struggle to cover basic needs such as rent, groceries, and healthcare. There are reports of workers having to decide between paying for their medication or their bills, or seeking financial assistance from family members or food banks.

The shutdown has also highlighted the precariousness of working in the public sector, with many employees suffering from job insecurity and low wages compared to their private sector counterparts. The shutdown has put a spotlight on the often-overlooked work that these employees carry out to keep the country running, from processing tax returns to ensuring food safety and safeguarding national parks and museums.

As the shutdown drags on, both sides continue to point fingers at each other, with Trump insisting on funding for the border wall and Democrats holding firm against the proposal. The issue has become a political football, with little room for compromise or consensus.

The economic and social costs of the shutdown continue to mount, and the longer it persists, the greater the damage. Businesses that rely on federal workers and contracts are feeling the financial impact, while the overall economy is taking a hit as well.

While the Brexit negotiations have been complicated and seemingly never-ending, the US government shutdown is a reminder of the importance of political stability and the need for leaders to find common ground to resolve disputes. As the shutdown rolls on, it is important to remember the individuals who are bearing the brunt of the political impasse – the federal workers and their families who are struggling to make ends meet in uncertain times.
