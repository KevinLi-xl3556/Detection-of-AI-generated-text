Julián Castro, former United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has officially announced that he is ending his bid for the presidency. He cited the fact that “it simply isn’t our time” in a video message that he released on Thursday. His campaign, which was focused on tackling issues such as climate change, immigration, and income inequality, struggled to gain traction in a crowded field of candidates.

Castro, who was the only Latino candidate vying for the presidency, garnered support and admiration from many for his message and policies, particularly on immigration. However, he consistently polled near the bottom of the field and was unable to make much of an impact in the debates.

In his message, Castro thanked his supporters and highlighted the importance of diverse voices in the political landscape. “We’ve shaped the conversation on so many important issues in this race, stood up for the most vulnerable people, and given a voice to those who are often forgotten,” he said.

Despite his exit from the race, Castro has expressed that he is not done advocating for the issues he cares about. “I’ll keep working towards a nation where everyone counts, a nation where everyone can get a good job, good health care and a decent place to live,” he stated.

The announcement of Castro’s departure leaves eight candidates remaining in the race for the Democratic nomination. It also starkly highlights the lack of diversity among the remaining contenders, with no Latino candidates and only one Asian American candidate. This has prompted concerns about the party’s ability to connect with a broad range of voters.

Castro’s decision to end his campaign underscores the fact that running for president is a daunting task, and is not always fruitful, especially for candidates who don’t garner the necessary level of support. However, it also provides a reminder that the issues he stood for are important and deserve continued attention and advocacy.

In the words of Castro: “We have to keep fighting forward. We have to keep standing up for ourselves and the issues we care about. As long as we do that, I am confident that we will reach that better future that we all deserve.”
