Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer whose alleged sexual misconduct sparked the #MeToo movement, has been charged with rape in Los Angeles just as his New York trial began.

Weinstein, who faces five charges of sexual assault in New York, now faces charges of rape, sexual battery, and other offenses in Los Angeles, where the statute of limitations for sexual assault has been extended.

The charges stem from allegations made by two women in 2013, who claim that Weinstein assaulted them at separate times.

This development comes as Weinstein's high-profile trial in New York began on Monday. The trial is expected to last for several weeks, during which prosecutors plan to call dozens of witnesses, including actresses who claim that they were sexually assaulted by Weinstein.

Weinstein's defense team has argued that any sexual relationships he had were consensual.

However, the Los Angeles charges could complicate Weinstein's case. If convicted in California, Weinstein could face an additional 28 years in prison.

Weinstein has faced legal and career consequences since the first allegations against him emerged in 2017. He was dismissed from his position at Miramax, and barred from attending the Academy Awards. He has also faced a series of Civil lawsuits from accusers, which have been settled or dismissed.

The New York Times article highlights the significance of the Weinstein case, as it has been viewed as a test of the #MeToo movement and its effectiveness in holding powerful men accountable for their actions.

The article concludes with a quote from one of Weinstein's accusers, actress Mira Sorvino.

"There's no way to undo what he did to so many people," she said. "But this is about making sure it never happens again."
