The Romance Writers of America, a prestigious professional organization for romance writers, has made the difficult decision to cancel its annual awards program. The news was reported by The New York Times on Tuesday, November 19, 2019.

The decision to cancel the awards program comes after a long-standing controversy within the organization. In August 2019, allegations of racism and discrimination were raised against the organization after the group announced the finalists for its annual RITA Awards. One of the finalists, author Courtney Milan, spoke out against the selection process, citing issues with the lack of diversity in both the judges and the nominees. The controversy sparked a broader conversation about discrimination and inclusivity within the romance genre.

The RWA initially defended the selection process and the finalists, sparking a backlash from members and the larger romance community. Many authors and industry professionals called for changes within the organization to address the issues of diversity and discrimination. In response, the RWA formed a committee to review its policies and made promises to increase diversity in its leadership and membership.

However, despite the efforts to address the underlying issues, the RWA ultimately decided to cancel the awards program for 2020. In a statement, the organization explained, “Due to recent events in RWA, many in the romance community have lost faith in both the organization and the award process. We cannot move forward with the ceremony or a celebration of romance fiction and will instead, refund all entry fees and sponsorship payments.”

The decision has been met with mixed reactions from the romance community. Some authors and readers applaud the decision, viewing the cancellation as a necessary step towards addressing the larger issues of diversity and inclusion within the genre. Others, however, are disappointed and feel that the cancellation is a punishment to the finalists who worked hard and deserved recognition for their achievements.

Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that the controversy within the RWA has sparked an important conversation about diversity and inclusivity within the romance genre. The decision to cancel the awards program is just one part of a larger effort to address these issues and create a more inclusive and welcoming community for all romance writers and readers.
