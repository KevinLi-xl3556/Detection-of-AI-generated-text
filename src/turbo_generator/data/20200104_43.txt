As we enter the new year, the 2020 presidential race is heating up. With the Iowa caucuses just a few weeks away, candidates are stepping up their campaigns in hopes of gaining the support of voters.

This past week, there were a few notable moments in the race. On Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden held a rally in Iowa, where he discussed his plans for healthcare and education. He also pledged to work for unity in the country, saying that "we've got to come together" and that "we can't continue to be as divided as we are."

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren also had busy weeks on the campaign trail. On Wednesday, Sanders held a rally in New Hampshire, where he spoke about his plans to address climate change and income inequality. Warren, meanwhile, released a plan to combat corruption in Washington and eliminate the influence of big money in politics.

Other candidates, such as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and businessman Andrew Yang, also made headlines this week. Buttigieg released a new ad in Iowa that highlighted his military service, while Yang continued to promote his proposal for a universal basic income.

One issue that has been at the forefront of the race is the escalating tensions with Iran. Many candidates have criticized President Trump's handling of the situation, with some calling for an end to military engagement in the Middle East.

As the race continues to heat up, it's becoming clear that there are a few key issues that are on the minds of voters. Healthcare, income inequality, and climate change are just a few of the topics that candidates are addressing in their campaigns.

Ultimately, it will be up to the voters to decide who they want to see as the next president of the United States. With the Iowa caucuses just around the corner, the race is sure to continue to be a topic of discussion in the coming weeks.
