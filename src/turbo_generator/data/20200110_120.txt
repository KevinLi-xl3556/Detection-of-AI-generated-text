Hudson Yards Promised a Park. They Didnâ€™t Mention the Giant Wall.
- The New York Times

Hudson Yards, the largest private real estate development in the United States, made headlines when it opened in 2019. The 28-acre complex boasts luxury condos, high-end retail shops, numerous restaurants, a cultural center, and an observation deck. However, one of its major selling points was its promised elevated park, which would provide a much-needed green space in the midst of Manhattan's concrete jungle.

While the park, known as the "Vessel", has become a popular tourist attraction with its distinctive beehive-like structure and 80 viewing platforms, it has created controversy in the community due to the surrounding 15-story, 700,000-square-foot wall.

The wall, which encloses the edge of the park, has come under heavy criticism for blocking views of the skyline and for shutting out natural light from the park. In addition, many residents have expressed concern that the wall will obstruct the free flow of air into the park and worsen air quality.

Hudson Yards officials have argued that the wall was necessary for safety purposes, as it serves as a barrier between the park and cars on the adjacent highway. They claim that the wall also helps to reduce noise levels and buffer the park from the sounds of the bustling city.

However, opponents argue that there could have been a better solution to the park's safety concerns that did not involve blocking views and light. Some have suggested building a lower wall or installing protective barriers that do not completely enclose the park.

The controversy over the Vessel's wall highlights the tension between urban development and public space. While the park provides a valuable green space for New Yorkers, its design begs the question of what constitutes a "public" space. Hudson Yards is overwhelmingly commercial, with luxury apartments and high-end businesses that are accessible only to a privileged few. The surrounding wall serves as a reminder of the exclusivity of the development and the challenges of creating infrastructure that is accessible to all.

While the park was billed as a significant step forward for community access to green space, the wall and the controversy surrounding it underscore the importance of considering the full implications of developments like Hudson Yards before rushing ahead with construction. The Vessel may be a tourist attraction, but it remains to be seen how many New Yorkers will engage with the park and how inclusive and accessible that engagement will be.
