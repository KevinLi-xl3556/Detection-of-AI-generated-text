The stunning escape of former auto executive Carlos Ghosn from Japan in December 2019 shocked the world. Now, about a year and a half later, new details have emerged about the daring operation that allowed him to flee. According to The New York Times, Ghosn received help from a former US Army Special Forces member, Michael L. Taylor, who used his military training to orchestrate the escape.

Taylor had been hired by Ghosn's team to help him evade authorities after he was charged with financial misconduct in Japan. On Dec. 29, 2019, Taylor and his son Peter flew from their home in Massachusetts to Japan where they met Ghosn in a hotel room in Tokyo. By the next morning, they had whisked him away in a box meant for concert gear.

The plan was risky and complicated, but it succeeded. Ghosn flew from Japan to Turkey in the case, and then boarded a private jet back to his home country of Lebanon, where he remains a fugitive.

Now Taylor is facing extradition to Japan to face charges of helping Ghosn escape. Taylor maintains his innocence, but if convicted, he could spend years in prison. 

The case has highlighted the growing trend of private military companies, which offer highly trained operatives for hire. It has also raised questions about the ethics of using military-style tactics to aid wealthy clients in legal trouble.

Critics argue that the use of private military companies for operations like Ghosn's escape undermines the rule of law and is fundamentally undemocratic. They also argue that it sets a dangerous precedent for other wealthy and powerful individuals who may want to evade justice in the future.

Others, however, see it as a necessary means of protecting the rights of the accused. They point to the often unfair and arbitrary nature of criminal justice systems in many countries, where innocent people can be subjected to harsh and unjustified punishment.

No matter where you stand on the issue, the case of Carlos Ghosn underscores the growing importance of private military companies in international affairs. As technology and globalization continue to blur traditional borders and legal systems, these companies will likely play an increasingly important role in shaping the course of history.
