Harold Burson, a pioneer in the field of public relations, passed away at the age of 98. Burson founded one of the world's largest public relations firms, Burson-Marsteller, and is widely recognized as one of the most significant figures in the industry's evolution.

Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Burson served in World War II before starting his career in public relations as a journalist. He quickly pivoted to public relations, starting his own firm in Memphis before merging it with other firms to create Burson-Marsteller in 1953. The company grew to be a global force, representing clients across industries and geographies.

Burson's contributions to the industry cannot be overstated. He was an early proponent of integrated communications, recognizing the importance of combining public relations with other marketing disciplines. He was also a champion of transparency and ethical practices, helping to create industry associations and codes of conduct that remain in place today.

Burson worked on some of the most significant communications challenges of his time. He helped Exxon respond to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, guided Johnson & Johnson through the Tylenol crisis in 1982, and advised Union Carbide during the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984.

Beyond his professional accomplishments, Burson was known for his integrity, kindness, and wisdom. His leadership shaped an industry and inspired generations of public relations professionals. He will be deeply missed.

Burson's passing is a reminder of the evolution of public relations and the important role that communication plays in business and society. As we navigate increasingly complex challenges and issues, we can draw inspiration from Burson's legacy and strive to uphold the principles he championed.
