Tom Brady and the Patriots Have to Part Ways Someday. Is It Too Soon?

Tom Brady has been the face of the New England Patriots for two decades, leading the team to nine Super Bowls and winning six of them. He has also won three Most Valuable Player awards, set numerous records, and inspired legions of fans who chant "Tom-my! Tom-my!" at the sight of him. But as Brady turns 43 in August, and enters the final year of his contract with the Patriots, the question arises: how much longer can he continue playing at an elite level, and should the Patriots extend his tenure or move on without him?

The New York Times recently analyzed the possibilities and challenges surrounding Brady's future with the Patriots, weighing the pros and cons of various scenarios. The article pointed out that Brady has expressed a desire to play until he's 45, which would mean at least two more seasons with the Patriots. However, the team hasn't given him a long-term contract extension, and instead signed him to a one-year deal that pays him $23 million, the same as last year.

The article noted that Brady's performance in 2019 was less statistically impressive than usual, as he threw for 4,057 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions, while completing 60.8 percent of his passes. However, the article also pointed out that Brady faced several challenges that affected his productivity, such as injuries and departures of key players (such as Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown), a weaker offensive line, and a lack of speedy receivers. In addition, the Patriots were eliminated from the playoffs in the wild-card round, marking their earliest exit since 2009.

The article also examined some possible scenarios for Brady and the Patriots in 2020 and beyond. One scenario is that Brady plays well this season, leads the team to the playoffs, and earns another extension or a huge contract from the Patriots, who remain loyal to him despite his age. Another scenario is that Brady struggles, gets injured, or doesn't mesh with the new offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, and leaves the Patriots after this season, either to retire or join another team. A third scenario is that the Patriots decide to move on from Brady before the season ends, either by trading him or benching him for the backup quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, who shows promise in training camp.

The article also mentioned some challenges that the Patriots face in replacing Brady, who has been their starting quarterback for 19 seasons. These challenges include finding a quarterback who can match Brady's leadership, experience, accuracy, and clutch performances, as well as adapting their offense to the new quarterback's strengths and weaknesses. Possible candidates for the Patriots include Stidham, a fourth-round pick in 2019 who didn't play much last season, and some veteran quarterbacks who are available on the free agent market, such as Cam Newton, Andy Dalton, Joe Flacco, or Jameis Winston.

The article concluded that the Patriots' decision regarding Brady's future will depend on various factors, such as his health, his performance, the team's success, and their long-term plans. While some fans and analysts may argue that the Patriots should stick with Brady regardless of his age or risks, others may argue that it's time for the team to transition to a younger, cheaper, and perhaps more dynamic quarterback, who can lead them into a new era of success. Whatever happens, the article suggested, the Patriots and Brady should cherish the memories and achievements they have shared, and respect each other's choices and legacies.

In summary, Tom Brady and the Patriots have to part ways someday, as all great partnerships come to an end. The question is not whether they will, but when and how. As the new season approaches, the Patriots and their fans can only hope that Brady will continue to defy age and expectations, and lead them to another championship. However, they should also prepare for the possibility that this might be his last hurrah in New England, and that the future might hold both uncertainty and excitement for the team and its fans.
