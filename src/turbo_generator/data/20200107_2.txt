On Tuesday, two skiers were killed in an avalanche near a popular skiing resort in Idaho. The victims were identified as 33-year-old George Lee and 39-year-old Sarah Smith. The incident occurred in the backcountry near the Bogus Basin ski area, just outside of Boise.

According to reports, the two skiers were part of a larger group skiing in the area when the avalanche struck. Despite efforts by other members of the group to dig them out, Lee and Smith were pronounced dead at the scene.

A local search and rescue team was deployed to the area to assess the situation and ensure that there were no other victims. The team also worked to recover the bodies of the two skiers.

This incident marks a tragic reminder of the dangers of backcountry skiing, particularly in areas with unstable snowpacks. Snowstorms and changing temperatures can create conditions that increase the risk of avalanches, making it essential for skiers to take appropriate precautions.

Experts recommend that backcountry skiers should carry essential safety equipment such as beacons, shovels, and probes, and undergo proper training to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to navigate challenging terrain.

It is also important for skiers to monitor current weather and avalanche conditions in the areas they plan to ski. While a fun activity, skiing in backcountry areas can be dangerous and requires the proper precautions to ensure the safety of those involved.

This tragic incident serves as a reminder to all skiers of the importance of safety and preparedness when embarking on backcountry adventures. The loss of Lee and Smith is a saddening event, and their families and loved ones are in our thoughts during this difficult time.
