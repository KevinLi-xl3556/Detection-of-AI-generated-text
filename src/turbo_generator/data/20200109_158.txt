Right-hand-drive cars have always been commonly associated with mail carriers, who need to be able to easily reach mailboxes situated on the side of the road. However, in recent years, these vehicles have become increasingly popular among the general public.

There are a few reasons why more people are choosing right-hand-drive cars, and one of them is the increasing demand for imported cars. Many countries, including Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia, drive on the left-hand side of the road, so naturally, their cars are designed with a right-hand-drive configuration. For car enthusiasts who want to enjoy cars that are exclusive to these markets, importing one of these vehicles will typically be the only option.

Apart from the novelty factor, there are other practical reasons why right-hand-drive cars are becoming more popular. For one, they offer better visibility. When driving on the left-hand side of the road, drivers sit on the left-hand side of the car, which can make it easier to see pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users. Additionally, transporting goods and passengers can be more efficient with a right-hand-drive car since curbside pickup and drop-off are more convenient.

Some may argue that right-hand-drive cars are difficult to operate, and may take some time to get used to. However, with the increasing availability of these vehicles, such doubts are becoming less of a concern. Many car manufacturers are opting to release right-hand-drive versions of popular models in markets where these cars are in high demand.

Of course, the main downside of right-hand-drive cars is that they may not be legal to drive in certain areas, particularly those with left-hand traffic. However, for those who are located in areas where they are allowed, having a right-hand-drive car can provide a unique driving experience that is sure to turn heads.

In conclusion, right-hand-drive cars are no longer just for mail carriers. With their increasing availability and practical benefits, more and more people are discovering the joys of driving on the "wrong" side of the car. While they may not be a fit for everyone, they are certainly worth considering for car enthusiasts looking for something unique and different.
