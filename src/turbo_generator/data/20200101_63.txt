The Norway Maples

The Norway Maples stand tall and true,
Flaunting their colors of warmest hue.
Their leaves ablaze with tones of gold,
With branches wide and stories untold.

The season's change brings a vibrant sight,
Of nature's beauty, shining bright.
The rustling leaves bring forth a sound,
A chorus in nature, spreading around.

The sun's rays shine down on each leaf,
Creating a shimmer and a brief relief.
From the worries of the world, we gaze,
At the Norway Maples and their beautiful ways.

For in this moment, we feel complete,
As nature's artwork we come to meet.
A reminder that life is ever-changing,
But beauty will always be worth arranging.

So here's to the Norway Maples so grand,
A symbol of seasons that we must understand.
For in their leaves and branches so fair,
We find nature's art that we must bear.
