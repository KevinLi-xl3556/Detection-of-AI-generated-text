‘Like a Boss’ Review: Tiffany & Rose’s Very Unfortunate Adventure - The New York Times

The Hollywood industry has been producing movies on female friendships for a while now. Some portray them in a positive light while others make them seem incredibly toxic. Unfortunately, ‘Like a Boss’ directed by Miguel Arteta, falls into the latter category.

The storyline of ‘Like a Boss’ revolves around two best friends Tiffany (Rose Byrne) and Rose (Salma Hayek) who run their own beauty company together. They've been working together for years but their friendship starts to fall apart when a wealthy businesswoman Claire Luna (played by the talented Jennifer Coolidge) offers to invest in their company.

The plot seems straightforward but is peppered with one-dimensional and clichéd elements that fail to deliver anything fresh or engaging to the viewers. The comedy is downright lazy and often relies on cheap laughs and innuendos that feel forced and uncomfortable rather than comedic. The chemistry between the two lead actors also feels poorly established, leaving the audience completely uninvested in their friendship or the outcome of their venture.

The performances are lackluster at best, even with an ensemble cast that includes several talented actors. Hayek tries too hard and overacts in every scene, while Byrne feels restricted to playing a one-dimensional character that is devoid of any substance. The only saving grace is Jennifer Coolidge, whose portrayal of a wealthy makeup mogul is spot-on.

Overall, ‘Like a Boss’ lacks substance, wit and entertainment value, making it extremely forgettable. It perpetuates tired stereotypes of female relationships and reinforces negative attitudes towards women in the workforce.

In conclusion, ‘Like a Boss’ is a movie to be avoided. Despite having a talented cast, the film fails spectacularly at creating likeable characters or an engaging storyline. Watch it at your own risk, but be warned: you might leave the theater feeling like you've just wasted two hours of your life.
