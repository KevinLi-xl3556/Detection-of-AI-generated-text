As time passes, we find ourselves further and further removed from World War II. The stories and experiences of those who lived through that tumultuous time are in danger of being lost forever. That’s why The New York Times is launching an initiative to help preserve the memories of those who were directly impacted by the war.

We’re reaching out to our readers, asking if you have living relatives who lived through World War II. Perhaps your grandparent was a soldier or nurse, or maybe your great aunt worked in a factory building planes. Whatever their role, we want to hear their story and help share it with the world.

Many of us grew up hearing stories from our grandparents about life during the war. However, not everyone is fortunate enough to have these stories passed down. That’s why it’s so important to document the experiences of those who lived through a time that changed the course of history.

By sharing these stories, we can gain a deeper understanding of what life was like for those who lived during this pivotal era. It’s easy to get caught up in the statistics and dates of World War II, but it’s the personal stories that bring the humanity back into the narrative.

If you have a relative who lived through World War II, we encourage you to sit down with them and ask them about their experiences. What did they see, hear, and feel? How did their life change during the war, and how did it impact them in the years that followed?

Once you’ve gathered their story, we invite you to submit it to The New York Times. We’ll review each submission and feature a selection of them on our website. You could help preserve a piece of history, and inspire others to do the same.

It’s easy to feel disconnected from events that happened decades ago, but we owe it to future generations to keep the memory of World War II alive. By collecting and sharing the stories of those who lived through it, we can ensure that their experiences continue to be remembered and valued.
