Sam Wyche, the former head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals, passed away on January 2, 2020 at the age of 74. Wyche was known as a leader who took the Bengals to their second Super Bowl appearance in 1989, and left a lasting impact on the NFL.

Born in Atlanta in 1945, Wyche played college football at Furman University before being drafted by the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals in 1968. He played for five seasons with the Bengals and led the team to the playoffs in 1973, but was forced to retire from playing due to a neck injury in 1976.

After retiring from the NFL, Wyche became an assistant coach for the Bengals and later the San Francisco 49ers. He was named the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals in 1984, and in his first season, he led the team to the playoffs for the first time in seven years. Wyche was known for his innovative use of the "no-huddle offense," which helped the Bengals reach new heights.

In 1988, under Wyche's leadership, the Cincinnati Bengals reached the Super Bowl for the second time in franchise history. Although they ultimately lost to the San Francisco 49ers in a closely contested game, Wyche's coaching and leadership were credited with the team's impressive season.

Wyche continued to coach in the NFL for several more years, leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Buffalo Bills. He retired from coaching in 1996 and became a commentator for CBS and NBC.

In addition to his coaching success, Wyche was also known for his kind and generous personality. He was always willing to help others and gave generously to charity. In 2016, he received a heart transplant after suffering from congestive heart failure.

Wyche's passing was mourned by many in the football world, including former Bengals players and coaches. Current Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said in a statement, "Sam was a bright light in this community and will be welcomed back to The Jungle for good."

Wyche leaves behind a lasting legacy in the NFL, as well as a deep impact on the lives of those who knew him best.
