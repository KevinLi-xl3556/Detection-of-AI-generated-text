On January 3rd, the United States carried out an airstrike in Baghdad that killed General Qasem Suleimani, a high-ranking Iranian military commander. The move sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East and triggered condemnations from Iran and its proxies.

What has gone largely unnoticed in the aftermath of the strike is that it also killed another major figure in Iraqi politics and military affairs: Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). The PMF is an umbrella group of mostly Shiite militias that played a key role in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq.

For the United States, Muhandis was equally important to Suleimani. He was widely regarded as Iran's main point of contact with the PMF, and his death will have a major impact on the group's operations. PMF commanders have vowed to retaliate against the United States, raising concerns about further escalation in the region.

The strike that killed Suleimani and Muhandis was carried out without the consent of the Iraqi government, which has sparked outrage in Baghdad. In fact, the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling on the government to expel all foreign troops from the country. This includes the thousands of American soldiers stationed there to fight ISIS.

The situation in Iraq is further complicated by the ongoing tensions between the United States and Iran. Iran has promised "severe revenge" for Suleimani's death, raising fears of a wider conflict. Meanwhile, President Trump has threatened to respond to any Iranian retaliation with an attack on Iranian cultural sites, which would be a clear violation of international law.

The airstrike that killed Suleimani and Muhandis has plunged the Middle East into a new crisis. It is unclear what the long-term consequences will be, but it is clear that the region is more unstable than ever. The United States and Iran must find a way to de-escalate tensions before it is too late.
