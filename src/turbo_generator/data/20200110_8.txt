The recent departure of Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has been a hot topic in the news. The New York Times recently reported that despite his dismissal, Muilenburg is set to receive a compensation package of more than $60 million. This news has sparked controversy and raised questions about executive compensation and accountability.

First, let's look at the facts. Muilenburg was fired by Boeing's board of directors in the wake of two crashes involving the company's 737 Max planes. The crashes, which occurred in Indonesia in October 2018 and Ethiopia in March 2019, claimed a total of 346 lives. The incidents were linked to a software problem in the planes' automated systems, which caused them to nosedive.

The crashes were a devastating blow to Boeing, which had long been considered a leading manufacturer of commercial airplanes. The 737 Max had been one of the company's most popular models, with hundreds of orders from airlines around the world. Following the crashes, however, the plane was grounded worldwide, and orders were cancelled or put on hold.

Muilenburg's dismissal came after months of criticism of his handling of the crisis. Critics accused him of downplaying the seriousness of the software problem and failing to take appropriate action. His departure was seen as a necessary step to restore confidence in the company and its products.

But the news that Muilenburg is set to receive such a large compensation package has raised eyebrows. The $60 million figure includes stock awards and other benefits that were granted to him over the years. For many people, it seems unfair that someone who oversaw such a major crisis should be rewarded so generously.

One argument in favor of Muilenburg's compensation is that it was part of his contract with the company. Like many high-level executives, he had a compensation agreement that spelled out the terms of his pay and benefits. It's possible that the board of directors felt obligated to honor those terms, regardless of the circumstances of his departure.

However, critics argue that such contracts are part of a larger problem with executive compensation in the United States. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, CEO compensation has grown much faster than that of the typical worker in recent decades. In 2018, the average CEO of a large company made 278 times what the average worker made.

This disparity has led some to call for reforms to the way executive compensation works. Some have suggested that companies tie pay more closely to performance, rather than simply guaranteeing large sums of money regardless of how well the company does. Others have called for limits on how much executives can earn overall, arguing that such large pay packages are simply unfair.

In the case of Muilenburg's departure, there is little that can be done now to change his compensation package. But the controversy is likely to continue to fuel debates about executive pay and accountability. As companies become more aware of the impact that their leaders can have on the public, and as stakeholders demand more transparency and accountability in corporate governance, we may see changes in how executive compensation is structured in the future.
