Books have the power to change our lives, to transform us into a different person or inspire us to take action. From children's stories to autobiographies of famous individuals, books allow us to see the world in a new way and, in turn, allow us to change ourselves or our lives.

Have you ever picked up a book that completely transformed your life? Perhaps it was a novel that opened your eyes to new perspectives, a self-help book that provided clarity and direction, or a memoir that gave you hope and inspiration. If so, we want to hear about it!

The New York Times is interested in hearing from individuals who have been impacted by a book. Whether it was a book that helped you through a difficult time, or one that led you to a new career path, we want to hear about how it changed your life.

Children's books are particularly impactful. As a child, books can teach us to dream big, to imagine new worlds, and to see the good in the world. As adults, books can help us heal, grow, and transform ourselves.

Authors, too, have the power to change lives through their words. They often share their own stories, their struggles, and their triumphs, inspiring readers to find their own path and to take action toward achieving their dreams.

The impact books can have on our lives cannot be understated. They are more than just a source of entertainment or education; they are a means of transformation. Books can open doors, create new opportunities, and inspire us to be the best version of ourselves.

So, if a book has changed your life in any way, we encourage you to share your story. The New York Times wants to hear from you and share your story with the world. Your words could inspire others to pick up a book and change their own lives.
