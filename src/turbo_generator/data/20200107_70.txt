As the 54th Super Bowl is just around the corner, companies and individuals alike are preparing for the biggest television event of the year. Among those vying for a spot during the game's commercial breaks are presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and President Donald Trump, both of whom have purchased advertisements for a reported $10 million each.

This price tag may seem staggering, but for these two high-profile figures, it may be a drop in the bucket. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman and former mayor of New York City, has already spent over $200 million of his own money on his campaign so far. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign and supporting groups have reportedly raised over $1 billion towards his reelection bid.

However, the Super Bowl's massive audience is not the only draw for these political figures. With the 2020 election just around the corner, both Bloomberg and Trump are likely hoping to make a big impression on voters by advertising during one of the most-watched events of the year.

But is this a smart move for their campaigns? The effectiveness of Super Bowl ads in terms of political messaging is up for debate. While a clever or entertaining commercial may grab viewers' attention, it may not necessarily translate to support at the ballot box.

Furthermore, the risk of backlash is significant. With political tensions running high and many Americans disillusioned with the political process, a political ad during a highly-anticipated sporting event may not sit well with viewers who tune in to escape from the current political climate.

Only time will tell if the $10 million investment will pay off for Bloomberg and Trump. But one thing is certain - come Super Bowl Sunday, all eyes will be on the TV screen, waiting to see what these two political heavyweights have to say.
