The sports world lost a visionary when David Stern, the former commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), passed away in January 2020. Stern was widely credited with taking the NBA to heights it had never reached before under his leadership, but his impact extended far beyond basketball and into the broader landscape of sports and entertainment.

Stern was a master of adapting to change and anticipating the future, a trait that was crucial in his role as commissioner, where he oversaw the league's transformation into a global brand. He set up offices abroad and established partnerships with international businesses to increase the NBA's reach and revenue, all while keeping the integrity of the game intact.

But it wasn't just international expansion that Stern predicted. Long before others in sports media and technology caught on, he foresaw the potential of digital media and the role it would play in the future of sports. In the late 1990s, Stern negotiated one of the first broadcasting deals with a digital company, RealNetworks, to stream live games over the internet. This was a bold move at the time, before most people even had access to high-speed internet, but it proved to be forward-thinking, as streaming has become a major part of the sports viewing experience in recent years.

Stern also took steps to protect NBA players and teams from the impact of disruptive technologies, such as file-sharing and piracy, which were emerging as significant threats to the industry. He was a strong advocate for intellectual property rights and worked with lawmakers to strengthen punishments for copyright infringement and counterfeiting.

Another area where Stern was ahead of the curve was in his focus on social justice and activism. He encouraged NBA players to use their platforms to speak out on issues they cared about, long before it became commonplace for athletes to do so. He also led the league's efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, advocating for the hiring of more women and people of color in leadership positions both within the league and in its partner companies.

Stern's legacy extends beyond his time as commissioner, as he continued to make an impact on sports even after he retired. He served on the board of technology company SportsCastr and invested in various start-ups focused on sports innovation. He was also a vocal advocate for legalized sports betting and recognized the potential for it to generate revenue for both the NBA and the sports industry as a whole.

In many ways, Stern was a true renaissance man for the sports world, with his impact felt far beyond basketball courts. He saw where the industry was headed before it got there and was unafraid to take bold steps to ensure the NBA stayed ahead of the curve. His intelligence, charisma, and vision will be sorely missed, but his legacy lives on and will continue to impact the sports world for years to come.
