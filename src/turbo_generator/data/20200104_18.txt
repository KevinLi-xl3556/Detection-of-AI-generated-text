The killing of Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian general who led the elite Quds Force, by a U.S. drone strike in January 2020 was a major moment in U.S.-Iran relations. Many analysts have debated whether the move deterred Iranian attacks or encouraged them. The answer is complicated, but it appears that the killing has not led to a decrease in tensions between the two nations.

On the one hand, the killing of Suleimani did deter some Iranian attacks in the short term. In the days following his death, Iran fired missiles at a U.S. military base in Iraq, but the attack resulted in no American casualties. This was a clear indication that Iran had limited its response, likely to avoid provoking a full-scale war with the United States. The Iranian leadership seemingly recognized that a major escalation could lead to even more devastating U.S. retaliation.

However, over the long term, the killing of Suleimani has done little to ease tensions between the two nations. In fact, many experts believe that it may have encouraged Iran to take more aggressive steps to retaliate against the United States. Almost immediately after Suleimani's death, Iran declared its intention to end its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal, which has been a source of major tension between the two nations. Additionally, since the killing, Iran has been implicated in several attacks on U.S. interests in the Middle East, including attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq and a Saudi Arabian oil facility.

Ultimately, the killing of Suleimani underscores the challenges of U.S. policy towards Iran. While some argue that the U.S. must maintain a strong presence in the region to protect American interests, others point out that such actions can easily provoke retaliation from Iran. The killing of Suleimani was a bold move by the U.S., but it may have been a risky one that has ultimately backfired. Moving forward, U.S. policymakers will need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of any action they take towards Iran, and consider the potential unintended consequences of their decisions.
