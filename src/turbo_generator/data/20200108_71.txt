The Smithsonian is set to bring American History to life in a series of graphic books. The new series is a fresh and exciting way to explore the history of America.

The Smithsonian has always been a source of pride for Americans, and its vast collection of artifacts and exhibits have provided an invaluable resource for researchers, educators, and the public. Now, the Smithsonian is taking this resource to a new level with a series of graphic books that will explore American history in a new, dynamic way.

The books will explore a range of topics, from the American Revolution to the Civil Rights Movement, and they will feature a range of perspectives – from the perspectives of individuals who lived through these events, to modern retellings of historical events.

As the New York Times reports, the books will be “part textbook, part graphic novel”, and they will be accessible to readers of all ages. The books will be written by a wide range of authors, including historians, graphic novelists, and educators.

The Smithsonian hopes that the books will appeal to a wide range of readers, including those who might not typically be interested in history. By presenting American history in a new, exciting way, the books aim to spark a love of learning in readers of all ages.

For educators, the books will be a valuable resource for teaching American history. By presenting history in a visual, engaging way, the books will help to bring the past to life for students. In addition, the books will be a great resource for students who are interested in exploring American history on their own.

Overall, the new graphic book series from the Smithsonian is an exciting development in the world of American history. By bringing history to life in a new, accessible way, the books will help to inspire and educate readers of all ages.
