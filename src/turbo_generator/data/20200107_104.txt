The saga of Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan and Renault, continues to unfold with new developments emerging almost daily. Now, it appears that Japanese prosecutors are targeting his wife, Carole Ghosn, in their ongoing case against her husband.

Mrs. Ghosn has been living in France since her husband’s arrest in Japan in November 2018 on charges of financial misconduct. However, according to a report in The New York Times, Japanese authorities are now pursuing her for perjury related to testimony she gave during her husband’s trial.

This is an unsettling turn of events for the Ghosn family, particularly given the harsh treatment Carlos Ghosn has received at the hands of Japanese prosecutors. He was initially held in custody for 108 days, during which time he was subjected to intense interrogation without a lawyer present. He was later released on bail, but then rearrested, leading him to flee Japan and seek refuge in Lebanon.

Mrs. Ghosn has maintained her husband’s innocence throughout the ordeal and has been a vocal advocate for his release. Her lawyer has called the latest move by Japanese authorities a “witch hunt” and a violation of her human rights.

The case against Carlos Ghosn has been widely criticized as being politically motivated. He was seen as a threat to the Japanese establishment due to his efforts to merge Nissan and Renault, which would have reduced the influence of Japanese executives. Supporters of Ghosn argue that the charges against him are trumped up and that he is being persecuted for his business decisions.

Regardless of one’s opinion on the case, it’s clear that the targeting of Carole Ghosn is a troubling development. It’s hard to see how her testimony, given during her husband’s trial, could justify a perjury charge. This appears to be nothing more than an attempt to put pressure on Carlos Ghosn and his family.

The situation is also a reminder of the broader issues at play in the case. Business leaders who operate globally are subject to a patchwork of laws and regulations, and it’s not always clear which jurisdiction holds ultimate authority. The Ghosn case highlights the need for greater clarity and consistency in international law, particularly when it comes to financial crimes and extradition.

For now, the Ghosn family is left in limbo, unsure of what actions may be taken against them by Japanese authorities. It’s clear that this case is far from over and that we can expect further twists and turns in the months and years to come.
