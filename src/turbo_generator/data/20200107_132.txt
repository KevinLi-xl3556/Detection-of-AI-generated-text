Cassius Winston, the star player for the Michigan State Spartans, has been through some tough times in recent years. His younger brother, Zachary, tragically passed away in November of 2019, and the pain of his loss is still felt by Cassius and his family every day. Despite the heartbreaking loss, Winston has found a way to honor his brother's memory before every game he plays for the Spartans.

According to a recent article in The New York Times, Winston has developed a routine of greeting his late brother before each game. As he takes the court, Winston pauses for a moment and taps the No. 5 patch on his jersey, which is a tribute to Zachary's favorite number. He then looks up to the sky and whispers a message to his brother, telling him that he loves him and that he is playing for him.

The ritual has become a source of comfort and strength for Winston, who has found it difficult to cope with the loss of his brother. In an interview with The New York Times, he spoke about the impact that Zachary had on his life and how much he misses him. "He was my best friend. He was my brother. He was everything to me," Winston said. "It's been tough. But I know he's always with me."

Winston has also found support from his teammates and coaches at Michigan State, who have rallied around him in the wake of Zachary's death. In a press conference after a recent game, his coach, Tom Izzo, spoke about the bond that the team has formed with Winston and how they are all there to support him. "He's an amazing young man. And what he's done for his family and what he's done for his brother's memory is amazing," Izzo said. "We're all there for him, and we'll continue to be there for him."

The story of Cassius Winston and his tribute to his late brother has touched the hearts of people across the country. Fans of the Spartans have expressed their admiration for Winston's strength and resilience, and many have sent messages of support and encouragement to the Winston family.

In a season that has been marked by tragedy and uncertainty, Cassius Winston has risen to the occasion and shown why he is considered one of the top players in college basketball. But it is his love for his brother and his dedication to his memory that will be remembered long after his playing days are over. As he continues to honor Zachary before every game, Winston is inspiring others to find the courage to keep going in the face of adversity.
