Opinion | After Iran’s Missile Attack

On the night of January 7th, Iran launched a missile attack on two American military bases in Iraq. The attack was in response to the killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani by American drone strikes. Despite initial concerns over the potential scale of the conflict, both sides have signaled a willingness to de-escalate tensions, and it appears that neither country wants a full-blown war.

However, this attack should be seen as a warning to the United States that its military presence in the Middle East is not welcome. It also highlights the failure of the Trump administration’s Iran policy. By unilaterally withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposing harsh sanctions on Iran, the U.S. has pushed the country to the brink of economic collapse, potentially forcing its leadership to take drastic measures to maintain its position in the region.

Furthermore, the attack underscores the need for diplomacy, rather than military engagement, in resolving conflicts in the Middle East. The U.S. must recognize that its actions have consequences, and it cannot impose its will on sovereign nations without repercussions. The use of force should always be a last resort, and alternative avenues for conflict resolution must be pursued.

The Trump administration must also recognize that its policies have isolated the U.S. from its allies in the region and around the world. By unilaterally withdrawing from the nuclear deal, the U.S. has undermined its credibility with its partners, making it difficult to build a coalition to address issues such as Iran’s nuclear program.

In the aftermath of the missile attack, both Iran and the U.S. have signaled a willingness to engage in dialogue. This should be encouraged and pursued as a means of preventing further escalation of tensions. Diplomacy, not military engagement, is the key to resolving the long-standing issues between the two countries.

The events of the past week should serve as a wake-up call to the Trump administration, highlighting the dangers of an aggressive and unilateral foreign policy. The U.S. should engage in a more nuanced and collaborative approach to solving conflicts in the region, one that recognizes the importance of diplomacy and relies less on the use of force. Only then can we hope to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.
