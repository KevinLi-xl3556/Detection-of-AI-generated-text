The Boeing 737 Max, once considered the future of flying, has turned into a public relations and financial nightmare for the aerospace company. The grounding of the aircraft after two fatal crashes has resulted in the fallout spreading to its suppliers. One such supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, has recently announced job cuts due to the ongoing crisis.

Spirit AeroSystems, which produces a significant amount of the 737 Max's fuselage, announced that it will be cutting 2,800 jobs at its facility in Wichita, Kansas - the largest employer in the city. The job cuts are expected to take place throughout 2020, and the company cites the grounding of the 737 Max as the primary reason for the layoffs. The company states that the grounding has resulted in a decrease in production, leading to a surplus of employees.

The announcement of the job cuts comes after Boeing announced its own layoffs, with plans to downsize by 20% due to the financial impact of the crisis. It is not just Boeing and its suppliers that are feeling the effects of the 737 Max grounding. Airlines, leasing companies, and airports have also been impacted.

Despite the negative news surrounding the 737 Max, Boeing has stated that they are committed to getting the plane back in the air. They have made progress on updates to the aircraft's software and have conducted several test flights. However, the Federal Aviation Administration has not yet approved the aircraft for flight.

The 737 Max crisis has not only impacted the aviation industry but also has taken a toll on the families of the victims of the two fatal crashes. The families have been tirelessly advocating for justice and safer practices within the industry. The grounding of the aircraft has given them time to grieve and push for change.

In conclusion, the fallout from the grounding of Boeingâ€™s 737 Max continues to spread as major suppliers, including Spirit AeroSystems, announce job cuts. The situation is a reminder of the complexity of the aviation industry and how one issue can have far-reaching effects. Hopefully, the industry takes note and prioritizes safety above profits going forward.
