Last year, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was passed as a way to give Californians more control over their personal information. The law, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, provides residents with the right to know what data companies are collecting about them, the right to request that it be deleted, and the ability to opt-out of the sale of that information. Here are some important things to know about CCPA and its impact:

Who does the law apply to?

The law applies to businesses that operate in California and meet one or more of the following criteria: have annual gross revenues exceeding $25 million; buy, sell, or share the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices; or derive 50 percent or more of their annual revenue from selling personal information.

What kind of personal information is covered?

The CCPA covers a broad range of personal information, including but not limited to: names, addresses, Social Security numbers, email addresses, and browsing history. The law also includes "sensitive" data such as health information, sexual orientation and geolocation.

What are the rights of California residents under CCPA?

CCPA gives Californians the right to access, delete, and opt-out of the sale of their personal information. They can request to know what data a company has collected about them, where it came from, and who it was sold to. They can also ask for the information to be deleted, and opt-out of the sale of their data altogether. Businesses are required to provide this information for free, and within 45 days of a valid request.

What are the requirements for businesses?

Businesses that are subject to CCPA must provide clear and conspicuous links on their website homepage and privacy policy that allow consumers to exercise their rights under the law. They must also provide a toll-free telephone number for consumers to make requests. In addition, businesses are required to establish procedures for verifying the identity of consumers who make requests, and to respond to those requests within 45 days.

What are the penalties for noncompliance?

Businesses that violate CCPA can face fines of up to $7,500 per violation. In addition, consumers have a private right of action under the law, which means that they can sue businesses for damages resulting from violations.

In conclusion, CCPA is a landmark law that gives Californians greater control over their personal information. While its impact is limited to California, it is likely to set a precedent for other states and even countries around the world. As more and more people question the use of their personal information, it is clear that data privacy is no longer a luxury, but a basic human right.
