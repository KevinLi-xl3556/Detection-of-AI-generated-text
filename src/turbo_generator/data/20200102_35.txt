Friday, February 14, 2020, saw multiple events happening across the globe that shook the world. From the devastating bushfires in Australia to the struggles of the Indian hotel start-up company Oyo, to the latest movie release by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese, let's delve deeper into the significant happenings of Friday.

Australia Fires:

The bushfires that have ravaged Australia since September 2019 continued to spread on Friday, with hundreds of homes being destroyed and thousands of hectares of land destroyed. The fires, which have been fueled by record-breaking high temperatures and droughts, have claimed the lives of 33 people, including firefighters. The country has received much-needed rainfall recently, but the fight to control the fires remains ongoing.

Oyo:

Oyo, an Indian hotel start-up company, has been facing numerous hurdles lately. The company, which operates in over 80 countries, has been accused of dubious accounting practices and mistreating hotel owners. The accusations have led to protests by hoteliers and legal trouble for Oyo's founder, Ritesh Agarwal, who has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, news broke that Oyo's app had been removed from the Google Play Store in India. The move is reportedly due to a violation of Google's policies.

Martin Scorsese:

The highly anticipated movie "The Irishman" by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese was officially released on Friday. The movie stars A-list actors such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino and tells the story of a hitman's involvement in the disappearance of labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa. The movie, which was originally released on Netflix, received critical acclaim and has already been nominated for several awards, including the Oscars.

In conclusion, Friday, February 14, 2020, was a day of significant events across the world. While the devastating bushfires in Australia continue to wreak havoc, the struggles of Oyo highlight the challenges faced by start-up companies. And on a lighter note, the release of "The Irishman" was a reminder of the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's filmmaking.
