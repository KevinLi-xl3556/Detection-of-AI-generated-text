For music lovers, record collectors, and historians, the collection amassed by Paul Mawhinney is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Over the course of several decades, Mawhinney has collected over three million records, making it one of the largest private music collections in the world. However, the collection is currently sitting in storage, and with Mawhinney’s advancing age, there are concerns about what will happen to this monumental collection.

Mawhinney, a former record store owner, began his collection back in the 1950s. Among his treasures are rare records from Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and other iconic musicians, as well as thousands of lesser-known but nevertheless significant works. His collection spans many genres, including jazz, classical, rock, and pop, making it a potentially invaluable resource to scholars and collectors alike.

Nevertheless, the future of this massive collection is uncertain. With Mawhinney now in his 70s, the question arises of what will happen to it when he passes away. Mawhinney has tried to sell the collection, but so far he has not found a suitable buyer willing to take on the logistical challenge of moving and housing such a massive collection.

One issue is that the collection is located in Pennsylvania, while potential buyers have been primarily located in New York and other metropolitan areas. Moving it would require a team of experts, as well as the right kind of storage facility. With many music stores closing down in recent years, finding a suitable space for storage could be a challenge.

Another hurdle is the sheer cost of maintaining the collection. While Mawhinney has diligently cataloged and stored his records, they require more effort to maintain than digital files. They must be kept in climate-controlled environments to prevent warping, which can be expensive over the long term.

Despite these challenges, Mawhinney’s collection represents an important part of music history that deserves to be recognized and preserved. While major institutions like the Smithsonian or the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame have expressed interest in the collection, they have yet to make a concrete offer.

Ultimately, whoever takes charge of the collection will need to appreciate its significance and be willing to invest the time and money required to take care of it. This collection is a treasure trove of musical history that should not be lost, and for that reason, it deserves a suitable home. We can only hope that someone will step up to the challenge of giving Mawhinney’s collection the home it deserves.
