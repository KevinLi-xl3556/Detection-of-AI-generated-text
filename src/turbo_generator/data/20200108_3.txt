President Trump recently delivered a speech addressing the ongoing conflict with Iran. In his address, he made several controversial statements that have caught the attention of the media and the public alike. The New York Times conducted a fact-checking of his speech to evaluate the accuracy of his claims.

Trump began his speech by asserting that “no American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.” The New York Times fact-checked this statement and found it to be false. In reality, several American soldiers have suffered injuries and at least 11 were transported out of Iraq for medical attention as a result of the Iranian missile attacks.

Trump also claimed in his speech that “Iran appears to be standing down” and that “the fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean that we have to use it.” The New York Times fact-checked these statements and found them to be misleading. The truth is that tensions between the US and Iran remain high, and there is no guarantee that Iran will not retaliate in the future.

Furthermore, Trump suggested in his speech that the Obama administration provided Iran’s government with $150 billion and “$1.5 billion cash loaded onto an airplane.” The New York Times fact-checked this statement and found it to be false. While the nuclear deal lifted sanctions on Iran and unfroze $100 billion in Iranian assets, estimates project that Iran only received $50 billion in cash and assets.

Finally, Trump claimed that “Iran’s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.” The New York Times fact-checked these statements and found them to be misleading. The nuclear deal was actually signed in 2015, and Iran’s hostilities have been ongoing since before the deal was reached. Additionally, the $1.8 billion in cash was not given to Iran as part of the nuclear deal, but rather was a settlement of a pre-existing legal claim that Iran had against the US.

In conclusion, the New York Times’ fact-checking of Trump’s speech on the Iran conflict reveals that several of his statements were either false or misleading. As tensions continue to escalate between the US and Iran, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the information being presented to the public in order to make informed decisions and form well-rounded opinions.
