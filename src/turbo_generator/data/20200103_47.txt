Behind the Cover: How to Get Out of Prison

On June 7, 2020, The New York Times Magazine published a striking cover story, titled "How to Get Out of Prison," featuring an illustration of a giant hand bursting through prison bars. The author, Emily Bazelon, investigates the role of parole and clemency in the American criminal justice system, sharing the stories of several prisoners who have applied for and either gained or been denied these forms of release. While the article raises complex ethical and practical questions, it also offers some insights into how inmates can navigate a system that often seems designed to keep them in.

One of the main points Bazelon makes is that despite the popular image of parole as a reward for good behavior or an opportunity to prove remorse, it actually serves as a means of control and surveillance for correctional agencies. She notes that many parole conditions, such as curfews, drug tests, and mandatory employment, can lead to technical violations that result in re-arrest and reincarceration. Furthermore, parole boards, which have great discretion in granting or denying release, often use arbitrary or biased standards that punish people for factors beyond their control, such as race, gender, or age. Bazelon argues that parole should be reformed or replaced by a system that prioritizes risk assessment and community support, rather than punishment and stigmatization.

Another form of release available to some inmates is clemency, which refers to the power of governors, presidents, and other executive officials to reduce or commute sentences. Bazelon tells the stories of several people who have sought clemency for various reasons, such as health problems, family emergencies, or wrongful convictions. She highlights the role of lawyers, activists, and celebrities who advocate for clemency on behalf of individual cases or broader policy changes. However, she also shows how clemency can be a political and bureaucratic process that depends on factors unrelated to the merits of a case, such as public opinion, media coverage, or connections. She notes that despite some recent improvements in clemency rates, especially at the state level, many prisoners who deserve relief still face long odds.

Throughout the article, Bazelon emphasizes the human costs of mass incarceration and the possibilities for change. She interviews not only prisoners but also their families, victims, and advocates, providing a multifaceted and empathetic view of the issue. She also cites historical and global examples of different approaches to release and reentry, such as Norway's focus on rehabilitation and social welfare or South Africa's use of truth and reconciliation commissions. While Bazelon acknowledges that no single solution exists, she makes a compelling case for reducing the use of prison as a default response to crime and increasing the use of community-based alternatives and restorative justice practices.

Overall, "How to Get Out of Prison" is a thought-provoking and informative article that sheds light on a crucial aspect of the criminal justice system often overlooked or misunderstood. By exposing the flaws and potential of parole and clemency, Bazelon challenges readers to rethink their assumptions and take action to create a more equitable and humane society. The cover image, created by the artist Brian Rea, captures both the desperation and the resilience of prisoners who seek to break free from their confinement and the systems that keep them there.
