The horror genre has had a resurgence in recent years with movies such as ‘Get Out,’ ‘Hereditary’ and ‘A Quiet Place’ standing out as exemplary in the genre. However, ‘The Grudge’ fails to make a mark on horror. 

The movie revolves around a curse that haunts a house in Japan, but has now spread to a small town in America. The film revolves around a dark past, which is supposed to frighten us, but instead leaves us scratching our heads. The curse is so convoluted and confusing that we are left wondering what’s happening, and not in a good way. 

The film tries to establish a connection between its characters, but ends us being forced and insincere. The movie feels like it’s trying too hard to make its audience care, but instead has the opposite effect. This could have been helped with better characters, but unfortunately, every one of them is one-note and flat. 

The pacing of the film is unbalanced. The first half of the movie takes time to set the stage, before it finally starts to move. However, the second half of the film is too rushed and leaves too many open threads. The ending feels less like a satisfying conclusion and more like an abrupt end to an incomplete story. 

The cast of the film, which includes Andrea Riseborough, John Cho and Demián Bichir, do their best, but the script doesn’t give them much to work with. The film constantly brings in new characters, but never gives them enough screen time to actually matter. 

One aspect that cannot be faulted is the film’s visual style. The cinematography and lighting are both effective in creating an atmosphere of dread, which helps sell the scares. However, the film relies heavily on jump scares, which become tiring and predictable after a while. 

Overall, ‘The Grudge’ fails to be a standout in the horror genre. The curse that haunts the film is so convoluted that it gets in the way of the story and the characters. The movie is slow-moving in places and rushed in others, making it feel unbalanced. While the film has good visuals, it relies on jump scares to sell its horror, which is ultimately disappointing. If you want to watch a horror movie, there are better options out there.
