In a significant move, a number of NATO troops have begun leaving Iraq, marking a substantial shift in their involvement in the region. The New York Times reported that the decision was made in part due to the increasing tensions between the United States and Iraq as well as concerns over the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As per reports, this pullback involves a staff of approximately 500 troops who had been working on training and advising Iraqi security forces since October 2018. While the withdrawal is modest in scale and not an indication of a complete pullback by any stretch, it does represent a change in the previously-unwavering commitment to Iraq that the NATO countries have maintained in recent times.

The pullback comes after the U.S. carried out a drone strike on Baghdad airport that killed General Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian commander, and other senior military officials. The action ignited a diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and Iraq, with the latter calling on all foreign forces to withdraw from the country. While NATO forces were not explicitly mentioned, their presence has been a sensitive issue, with militias and other groups often targeting them in attacks.

In addition to the political issues, the worsening COVID-19 pandemic has added to the complexities of maintaining the training and advisory staffs in Iraq. A statement released by NATO headquarters mentioned that the decision to start the withdrawal was "due to the COVID-19 situation and the increased threat level facing our personnel."

The situation in Iraq in recent years has necessitated the presence of NATO forces working to aid local security forces in their fight against ISIS, which had taken over a large swath of territory in the country. With ISIS having been considerably weakened, there has been growing pressure to reduce the number of foreign troops.

This latest move highlights the transitional phase that is presently in progress in the troubled region. It also represents a sign that NATO feels the time has come to reduce its involvement in Iraq, making it a more opportune time for the country to take the lead in its fight against ISIS and other threats.
