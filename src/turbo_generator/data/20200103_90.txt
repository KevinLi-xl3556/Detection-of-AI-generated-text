As the presidential race heats up, the candidature of Pete Buttigieg has gained significant momentum, with the announcement that he raised $24.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, placing him among the top contenders in campaign fundraising.

But with this fundraising success comes scrutiny about the sources of the donations, particularly from the top one percent of earners. Is Buttigieg becoming a candidate of the rich, catering to the elite rather than the broader American populace?

It is essential to note that Buttigieg has been a vocal proponent of campaign finance reform, raising concerns about the influence of wealthy donors on the election process. He has criticized the Citizens United decision, which allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns.

However, the recent fundraising data from the Buttigieg campaign indicates a significant contribution from Wall Street executives, billionaires, and other wealthy donors who have historically supported centrist candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.

Some of these donors include Seth Klarman, a hedge fund manager, who gave $500,000 to Buttigieg's campaign, Hamilton "Tony" James, the Blackstone Executive, who donated $50,000, and Neil Bluhm, a Chicago-based real estate billionaire, who contributed $2,800.

Buttigieg's donor base has also come under scrutiny for its lack of diversity. Reports have shown that the majority of Buttigieg's donors are white, and only 8 percent are from low-income backgrounds. Buttigieg's reliance on wealthy donors, particularly from the tech industry, has also raised concerns about his ability to address concerns over income inequality and the influence of big tech companies.

Buttigieg himself has acknowledged these criticisms, stating that he understands the need to broaden his donor base and include more working-class supporters. In his plan for comprehensive democracy reforms, he proposes policies to strengthen unions, reduce the influence of money in politics, and promote voting rights, all aimed at creating a more equitable society.

It is essential to recognize that Buttigieg's success in fundraising reflects his appeal to a broad range of supporters, particularly those who are drawn to his message of unity and hope. However, there is no doubt that his donor base, particularly from the top one percent, raises concerns about his ability to address issues of income inequality and the influence of wealthy elites in politics.

Ultimately, the question remains: can Buttigieg win the presidency with the support of the one percent while maintaining his commitment to equal opportunity and fairness for all Americans? The answer will depend on his ability to enact policies that promote the interests of working-class Americans, and not just the wealthy.
