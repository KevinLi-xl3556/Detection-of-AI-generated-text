After a tumultuous start in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers, Lonzo Ball has found a fresh start in New Orleans - and with it, a newfound confidence in his shot.

Drafted as the second overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, Ball entered the league as a highly-touted point guard, with his precise passing and court vision drawing comparisons to Lakers legend, Magic Johnson. However, Ball's struggles with his shot quickly became apparent, with his unorthodox shooting form holding him back in his first two seasons in the league.

Despite this, Ball remained confident in his abilities, and it was this self-belief that led him to seek a fresh start in New Orleans. Traded to the Pelicans in the summer of 2019 as part of the package for Anthony Davis, Ball arrived in Louisiana with a point to prove.

Under the tutelage of Pelicans head coach, Alvin Gentry, Ball has worked tirelessly to refine his shot, and the results have been impressive. A career 31% three-point shooter, Ball is now shooting at a career-high 38.3% from beyond the arc this season, an improvement that has not gone unnoticed by his teammates.

"He's been shooting the ball very confidently," said Pelicans forward, Brandon Ingram. "He's been taking the open shots that he's been given and knocking them down at a high rate."

Ball's newfound shooting touch has also translated to improved overall play. Averaging 14.5 points, 5.5 assists, and 4.2 rebounds per game this season, Ball has helped lead the Pelicans to a 25-33 record, with the team still in contention for a playoff spot in the Western Conference.

More than anything, however, it is Ball's attitude and approach to the game that has impressed those around him. Gentry notes that Ball's commitment to improving his shot has been inspirational to his teammates.

"The one thing that I've recognized is that this young man is not afraid to put in the work to become a better basketball player," Gentry said. "It's not just the natural ability that he has. It's the work ethic that he has to be able to accomplish what he wants to accomplish."

Lonzo Ball may have found a fresh start in New Orleans, but it is his newfound confidence in his shot that has truly set him apart this season. With a bit of luck and continued focus, who knows how much farther Lonzo Ball can go in the NBA.
