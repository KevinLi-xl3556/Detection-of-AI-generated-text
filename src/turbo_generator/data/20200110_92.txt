In a surprise move, Marianne Williamson has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race. Her announcement came on Friday, January 10th, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.

Williamson, a best-selling self-help author and spiritual teacher, first gained attention as an unorthodox candidate for the Democratic nomination. Her focus on love and consciousness as the solution to national problems set her apart from the other candidates.

Throughout her campaign, Williamson brought attention to issues such as reparations for slavery and the need to address the country's spiritual and emotional health. While her message resonated with some voters, she struggled to gain widespread support and failed to qualify for many of the Democratic debates.

In a statement on her campaign website, Williamson thanked her supporters and acknowledged that her campaign "didn't resonate" with enough voters to continue. She also encouraged her followers to continue their work for a "more conscious and compassionate America."

Despite her unconventional approach, Williamson was able to create a dedicated following of supporters drawn to her message of unity and love. Her role in the race may have been brief, but her impact on the national conversation about spirituality and politics is sure to be long-lasting.
