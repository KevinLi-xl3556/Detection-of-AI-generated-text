For decades, Frederick’s of Hollywood was the go-to destination for men seeking racy lingerie gifts for their partners. However, the iconic brand recently underwent a drastic brand overhaul, shifting its focus from fantasy and sex appeal to empowerment and authenticity.

The new Frederick’s of Hollywood, which emerged in 2017 after filing for bankruptcy, introduced a range of more inclusive products, targeting a broader audience of women who value comfort and support without sacrificing style. The latest collections feature wireless bras, bodysuits, and loungewear designed to flatter women of all shapes and sizes, making them feel confident and comfortable in their own skin.

The biggest challenge for the brand was breaking free from the outdated and demeaning image it had cultivated for years, which objectified women and promoted unrealistic beauty standards. The new Frederick’s of Hollywood recognized that times were changing and that women's values had evolved. Instead of perpetuating negative stereotypes and objectification, the brand pledged to offer products that make women feel good inside and out.

In an interview with The New York Times, Michelle Cordeiro Grant, the CEO of Frederick’s of Hollywood, said, “We have a very different approach than the brand has had in the past. We’re focused on making every woman feel confident, sexy, empowered and real.”

Indeed, the new direction of the brand has been embraced by customers who not only love the new range of products but also appreciate the message of authenticity behind it. Frederick’s of Hollywood understands that women are no longer willing to be defined solely by their sexuality, and that true empowerment lies in embracing and celebrating one's individuality.

The shift in focus has proven to be successful, with the brand experiencing a significant increase in sales, particularly among younger women seeking both comfort and style. Frederick’s of Hollywood has found new relevance and success in promoting diversity and inclusion, delivering products designed for everyone.

In conclusion, Frederick’s of Hollywood’s rebranding is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of society's values and the importance of reflecting that change in brands. The new focus on empowerment, authenticity, and inclusivity has given Frederick’s of Hollywood a fresh lease on life, making it more relevant and appealing to modern women than ever before. The brand's success serves as a reminder that it’s never too late to make a change and that businesses must always remain adaptable to stay relevant in an ever-changing world.
