Opinion | On Prison Reform, From the Inside

As someone who has experienced the United States prison system firsthand, I firmly believe that prison reform is necessary. Despite being designed to protect society from criminals and reduce crime rates, the current prison system fails to fulfill these objectives effectively.

During my time in prison, I witnessed firsthand the many flaws in the system. It was evident that many of the inmates didn't receive the services they needed, such as mental health or drug addiction treatment. Instead, they were left to their own devices, which often resulted in further criminal activities once released.

Furthermore, the focus on punishment as opposed to rehabilitation creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to changing behavior. Inmates are often treated harshly and without dignity, which can lead to resentment and anger. And when released into society, they are ill-equipped to reintegrate into civilian life and fail to make a positive contribution to society.

It is clear that there needs to be a shift in the focus of prisons towards rehabilitation. Programs must be implemented to help with the reintegration of inmates back into society, with the aim of reducing recidivism rates. Rehabilitation is not only more humane, but it is also more effective in reducing crime, and therefore maximizes the protection of society.

In addition to rehabilitation, there has to be a more significant emphasis on mental health treatment, particularly for those who find themselves in prison. For far too long, individuals with mental health issues have been left untreated, resulting in increased criminal activities. Failure to treat these issues only serves to worsen the problem, creating a revolving door effect whereby inmates repeatedly end up back in prison.

Finally, there must be changes in the prison system's funding which focuses on improving existing facilities and staff training. Correctional facilities should prioritize programs and activities beneficial to the well-being of inmates and focus on providing a safer and more conducive environment for rehabilitation.

In conclusion, the United States prison system needs reform, and there needs to be a more significant emphasis on rehabilitation over punishment. The implementation of programs that assist inmates' reintegration back into society, mental health treatment, and and changes to the prison system funding will help ensure that prisons are fulfilling their objectives while serving society effectively. It's a necessary change that'll enhance public safety, reduce recidivism, save lives, and lower crime rates.
