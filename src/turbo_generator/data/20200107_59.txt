In the heart of Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, an art scene flourishes amidst the chaos of urban life. The new documentary ‘System K’ captures the essence of this scene, showcasing a vibrant world of art and struggle.

Directed by Renaud Barret and Florent de La Tullaye, ‘System K’ explores the rise of street art in Kinshasa, where artists use their work to express their frustrations with a system that has failed them. The film follows the lives of several artists, including street painter Kongo, who switches from political posters to commissioned murals, and street photographer Robert Nzaou-Kissolo, who captures the city’s gritty glamour through his lens. 

At the center of the documentary is the character of Mzee, a charismatic and controversial figure who has become a patron of the arts in Kinshasa. Mzee runs a cultural center in the working-class neighborhood of Lingwala, which serves as a hub for the city’s artists. He offers them a space to create, a platform to share their work, and a community to belong to.

The film does not shy away from the harsh realities of life in Kinshasa, a city plagued by poverty, corruption, and violence. But it is also a celebration of the resilience and creativity of its people, who find ways to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.

The art in ‘System K’ is not just a form of self-expression, but also a form of resistance against a system that has oppressed and marginalized the people of Kinshasa. The artists’ work exposes the inequalities and injustices of their society, giving voice to those who are often silenced.

‘System K’ is a powerful and visually stunning portrayal of a city and a people who refuse to be defeated by their circumstances. It is a testament to the power of art to transform lives, and to the courage of those who create it.
