Harry Kupfer, a prominent German opera director known as the “Opera King of Berlin,” passed away on December 30th, 2019, at the age of 84. Born in Berlin in 1935, Kupfer's decades-long career included productions at leading opera houses around the world, most notably at the Bayreuth Festival and in his hometown at the Komische Oper Berlin.

Kupfer gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s for his innovative and avant-garde productions of classic operas. He placed a particular emphasis on portraying strong and complex female characters, leading to notable staging of works such as Richard Wagner's “Tristan and Isolde” and “The Ring Cycle”. These productions earned him wide critical acclaim and secured his place as a leading figure in the world of opera.

One of Kupfer’s most renowned productions was his staging of “The Magic Flute” by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which premiered at the Komische Oper in 1978. The production was praised for its unique blend of fantasy and political commentary, with underlying themes of the fight against terrorism and the pursuit of an ideal society. It was later revived several times and remains one of the most popular productions of the opera to this day.

Throughout his career, Kupfer challenged conventional thinking in opera and frequently faced controversy. He was known for his unconventional interpretations of classic works, and his daring approach to staging left an indelible mark on the world of opera, influencing many younger directors who followed in his wake.

Kupfer received numerous awards for his contribution to opera, including the “Order of Merit of Berlin” and the “Lifetime Achievement Award” from the International Opera Awards. He will be remembered as a pioneering and transformative figure in the world of opera, whose legacy will continue to inspire future generations of directors and performers.

Kupfer's passing marks the loss of a true artistic visionary, with tributes pouring in from across the music world. German Culture Minister Monika Grütters stated “with Harry Kupfer, not only have we lost one of the most significant and influential German directors of opera, but also a quiet, passionate and emphatic cultural mediator”. His work will continue to be celebrated for its boldness, its relevance, and its profound impact on the art of opera.
