The new documentary ‘Earth’, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, is a sobering reminder of the many ways in which human activity is harming the planet we live on. From climate change to deforestation, from overfishing to pollution, the film presents a stark picture of the damage being done to the Earth’s ecosystems and the species that depend on them. But while the message of ‘Earth’ may be bleak, the film itself is a stunning achievement that should not be missed.

Based on the BBC series ‘Planet Earth II’ and ‘Blue Planet II’, ‘Earth’ takes us on a global journey to witness some of the world’s most remarkable wildlife, from the Amazon rainforest to the Arctic tundra. But what makes this film unique is its focus on the interconnectedness of these habitats, and the impact that human activity is having on them all.

One of the most powerful sequences in the film takes place in the Malaysian rainforest, where a group of endangered orangutans are shown struggling to survive in a landscape that has been repeatedly devastated by logging and palm oil plantations. Watching these majestic creatures cling to their diminishing homes, it’s hard not to feel a sense of despair at the destruction that has been wrought by human greed and short-sightedness. But the film also makes it clear that it’s not just orangutans that are at risk: countless other species, both plant and animal, are facing similar threats as the planet’s ecosystems are pushed past their breaking point.

Yet amidst all this, ‘Earth’ also manages to find moments of hope and wonder. There’s a breathtaking sequence in the Arctic Ocean, for example, where a pod of narwhals – one of the planet’s most mysterious and elusive creatures – are shown swimming beneath the ice in search of food. This is not just a remarkable spectacle, it’s a reminder of the incredible diversity of life that still exists on our planet, and of the urgent need to protect it.

Overall, ‘Earth’ is a truly remarkable film that manages to be both beautiful and harrowing at the same time. It’s a powerful reminder of our responsibility to protect the planet we live on, and of the urgent need to take action to address the multiple threats facing our ecosystems before it’s too late. But beyond that, it’s also a cinematic achievement that deserves to be seen and appreciated for its stunning visuals and powerful storytelling. Highly recommended.
