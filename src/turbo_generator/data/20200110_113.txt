Jule Hall, a graduate of the Bard Prison Initiative (BPI), has the unique experience of spending his Sundays in a way that most people can hardly imagine. Although he has been released from prison, Hall still deeply values his time spent participating in the program that helped him earn an associate degree while incarcerated.

BPI, a privately funded college program for incarcerated individuals, is located in six interconnected prisons in New York State. The program is unique in its approach to education, offering college-level courses taught by professors from Bard College. Inmates are required to meet the same academic standards as students on the main campus in order to earn a degree.

Hall spent six years in prison before enrolling in BPI. After earning his degree, he became a mentor to other participants in the program, offering guidance and advice to those who were also seeking to complete their degrees.

On Sundays, Hall returns to the prison where his BPI journey began, taking part in study groups with current participants and assisting with college-level course work. He credits the program with giving him a new perspective on life and has said that BPI helped him understand the importance of self-reflection and introspection.

"I not only received an education, but I also discovered who I was capable of becoming," Hall said in an interview with The New York Times.

For Hall, spending his Sundays with BPI is not just about keeping his connection to the program alive, but about giving back and helping others who were once in his position. He feels a sense of duty to pay forward the knowledge and skills he learned while incarcerated.

"I want to make sure that the men and women who are currently taking part in BPI have the same opportunities that I had," Hall said. "I want to show them that if I can do it, they can do it too."

In addition to his work with BPI, Hall has also become an advocate for criminal justice reform. Speaking at conferences and events across the country, he shares his story to highlight the need for change in the American prison system.

Hall's dedication to the BPI program and to reforming the criminal justice system is a testament to the transformative power of education. Through his commitment to helping others, he has demonstrated that anyone, regardless of their circumstances, can make a positive impact on the world around them.
