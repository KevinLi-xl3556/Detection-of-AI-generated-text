Nicky Haslam's House of Commons - The New York Times

If you're a fan of British design and architecture, you've probably heard of Nicky Haslam. He's one of the most influential designers of our time, having worked on projects ranging from private homes of British royalty to luxury hotels in Paris and New York. But what sets him apart from other designers is his love for creating interiors that are not just beautiful, but also full of personality and history. And nowhere is this more evident than in his own home - the House of Commons.

Located in London's Chelsea neighborhood, the House of Commons is a Georgian-era townhouse that Haslam transformed into his own personal masterpiece. As he wrote in his book, "Nicky Haslam's Folly De Grandeur," the house "took on a life of its own, growing and expanding with new ideas and acquisitions, until it had become the complete, furnished, fully functioning House of Commons."

And what a house it is. From the moment you enter, you're greeted by an explosion of color and pattern that is quintessentially Haslam. The entryway is adorned with a bold black-and-white stripe wallpaper, while the living room features an eclectic mix of furniture, including a bright pink sofa, an African mask, and a painting by contemporary artist Cecily Brown. The dining room is equally as striking, with its bright blue walls, red curtains, and black-and-white checkered floor.

But what really sets the House of Commons apart is the way Haslam has incorporated elements of British history and culture into the décor. The walls are lined with artwork and photographs of iconic British figures, from Winston Churchill to Queen Elizabeth II. A room dedicated to the Duke of Wellington features a replica of his hat, while the library is filled with books and memorabilia from Haslam's own collection of historical artifacts.

The House of Commons has become something of a mecca for lovers of design and British culture. Haslam regularly hosts events and tours of the house, allowing people to experience his unique style firsthand. And with its ever-evolving décor, there's always something new to discover.

In a world where so many interiors feel sterile and impersonal, Nicky Haslam's House of Commons is a breath of fresh air. It's a place where creativity and history collide, resulting in a space that is not only beautiful, but also deeply personal. And as Haslam himself said, "I hope that everyone who visits comes away feeling they have been part of something special, and above all, something that is British."
