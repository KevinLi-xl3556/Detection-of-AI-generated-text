In a twist of events in the Curtis Flowers case, the white prosecutor Doug Evans has requested to recuse himself from the case. The New York Times reported that Evans, who has been the prosecutor in the case for over two decades, made the request on Friday. 

The case involves Curtis Flowers, a black man who was tried and convicted six times for the murder of four people in Mississippi in 1996. His sixth conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2019 due to Evans' history of racial discrimination in jury selection. The Supreme Court ruled that Evans had violated the Constitution by excluding black jurors from Flowers' trial, which was held in 2010.

Now, in a move that has been described as unusual, Evans has requested to be recused from the case. The reason for his request remains unclear, but it has been speculated that Evans might be facing disciplinary action for his conduct in the Flowers case.

The case has been a controversial one, and Evans' request to recuse himself has raised questions about the future of the case. Some have speculated that the case may be dismissed altogether, while others have suggested that it may continue with a new prosecutor.

The Flowers case has become a symbol of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system, with many arguing that he was unfairly targeted and convicted due to his race. The case has also raised concerns about the fairness of jury selection in criminal trials, and many are hoping that the case will lead to reforms in the system.

For now, it remains to be seen what will happen next in the Flowers case. However, Evans' decision to recuse himself has raised hopes that justice will finally be served in this long and complicated case.
