The Trump administration has once again accused Iran of aggressive behavior. This time, the allegation is that Iranian officials were plotting to blow up the American embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The claim was made by President Donald Trump through his Twitter account, in a now familiar pattern of making major foreign policy announcements via social media.

The tweet read, "According to press reports, Iran may be planning an assassination, or other attack, against the United States in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani. Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!"

The claim was made without any supporting evidence, and prompted immediate skepticism from many quarters. Critics accused the president of trying to divert attention from his domestic troubles by pinning the blame on Iran. Others questioned why the administration would make such a startling claim via Twitter, rather than through official channels.

The incident underscores the difficult relationship between the United States and Iran, which has been marked by tense rhetoric and increasing military posturing. In recent months, both sides have engaged in a round of tit-for-tat attacks, with the United States killing a top Iranian general in January and Iran launching a barrage of missile strikes against US forces in Iraq.

Many Iran experts believe that the Trump administration's Iran policy has been misguided, and that its "maximum pressure" campaign is unlikely to achieve its stated objectives of forcing Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions or to cease its support for proxy groups in the Middle East.

This latest accusation is likely to further inflame tensions between the two sides and increase the likelihood of escalation. It remains to be seen whether there is any truth to the president's claim, or whether it is simply another attempt to shift attention away from his personal and political woes.
