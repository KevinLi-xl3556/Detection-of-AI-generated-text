The New York Times recently reported that YouTube will implement new privacy practices for children. Here are four things you should know about this big change:

1. YouTube is facing a hefty fine.

YouTube is owned by Google, which is a unit of Alphabet Inc. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that YouTube violated the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting data on children under the age of 13 without parental consent. YouTube is expected to pay a fine of $170 million to the FTC as a result of this violation.

2. YouTube is changing its practices.

To comply with COPPA, YouTube will make a significant shift in how it handles children's content. Starting in January 2020, all videos that specifically target children or have a high likelihood of attracting children under 13 will no longer run personalized ads or support features such as comments, live chat, or end screens. YouTube will also stop collecting data on videos and channels that are identified as made for kids.

3. The change will impact content creators.

Many content creators are concerned about how this change will affect their channels, since they may lose revenue from ads and interaction with their viewers. YouTube has assured creators that it will offer resources and tools to help them understand and comply with the new guidelines.

4. The change may not go far enough.

Some advocates argue that YouTube's new privacy practices still leave children vulnerable to inappropriate content and data collection. They point out that kids could still watch videos intended for adults without being properly monitored, and that some ads targeted at children may not be recognizable as such.

In conclusion, YouTube's new privacy practices represent a significant shift in how the platform handles children's content. However, the implications of the changes remain uncertain, and it remains to be seen how effective they will be in protecting children's privacy online.
