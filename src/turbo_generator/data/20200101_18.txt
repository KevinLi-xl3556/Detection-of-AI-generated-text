On November 26th, 2019, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 on the Richter scale struck the city of Durres in Albania, with its epicenter located in the Adriatic Sea. The earthquake resulted in the deaths of 51 people, over 900 injured, and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. However, the tragedy of the earthquake in Albania is not just limited to the immediate loss of life and property, but also highlights the region's unpreparedness for a seismic event of such magnitude.

The incidence of earthquakes is not uncommon in the Balkans, with the region being located in a seismically active area due to the convergence of the African, Eurasian, and Adriatic tectonic plates. In fact, the area is known as a seismic belt and has experienced numerous devastating earthquakes in the past, including the 1979 earthquake that struck Montenegro, Bosnia, and Serbia and killed over 100 people.

Despite this, many Balkan countries, including Albania, do not have adequate earthquake preparedness measures in place. Building regulations are often lax, with many buildings constructed without following proper seismic codes, making them vulnerable to collapse during an earthquake. Furthermore, a lack of proper emergency infrastructure and training means that many people are left without access to medical resources or trapped in collapsed buildings for an extended period before help can reach them.

The consequences of such knowledge gaps are self-evident: if the region is hit by an earthquake with a higher magnitude, the cost in human lives and material losses could be catastrophic. Therefore, it is crucial for the Balkans' governments to invest in earthquake preparedness measures and infrastructure to ensure that their citizens are more equipped to deal with future seismic events properly.

One of the essential steps that Balkan governments could take in earthquake preparedness is to implement strict building regulations that adhere to seismic codes. The construction of new buildings must be held to robust seismic building codes, and existing buildings that are not insured must undergo structural analysis and retrofitting measures.

Additionally, governments should focus on the construction of earthquake-resistant public infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and communication centers. By investing in strong public infrastructure, governments can help to minimize the loss of life, injury, and damage to people's livelihoods.

Further investment in emergency resources, including search and rescue teams and evacuation plans, is also critical. Training emergency responders and volunteers is key as well, to ensure they are equipped to adopt the correct response protocols quickly.

The Balkans' vulnerability to earthquakes is well known, and the earthquake in Albania is a stark reminder of the region's unpreparedness. It is time for the Balkan countries' governments to prioritize earthquake preparedness to ensure that their people are more equipped to deal with seismic events properly. Proper earthquake preparedness measures are not only crucial for saving lives and minimizing damage during an earthquake, but they are also critical for the region's overall safety and prosperity.
