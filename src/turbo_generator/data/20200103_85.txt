The year 2020 has been a deadly year on the streets of New York City. According to the New York Times, the total number of traffic fatalities in the city has surpassed the previous year's numbers, marking the first increase in traffic deaths after six consecutive years of decline.

The pandemic and lockdowns had reduced the overall number of vehicles on the roads, and in the early months of 2020, it appeared that fewer cars and trucks could translate to fewer fatalities. However, as the city reopened, the number of reported crashes increased, and so did the number of fatal accidents.

Pedestrian fatalities have been the most prominent contributor to the rising numbers, accounting for 62% of all traffic deaths. As per the Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic deaths, the city had implemented measures to protect pedestrians, such as increasing the number of bike lanes, enforcing speed limits, and implementing traffic-calming measures.

However, these measures did not prove to be enough, and the city was still plagued with reckless drivers and unaware pedestrians. In some cases, drivers would speed through intersections or run red lights, continuing with their aggressive and dangerous behavior.

The rising number of traffic deaths has raised significant concerns amongst the general public, city officials, and policy-makers. The mayor's office stated that the rise in the number of fatalities was unacceptable and committed to increasing the use of red-light cameras and increasing the number of bike lanes, among other measures.

Meanwhile, the Transportation Department has increased its public awareness campaigns about distracted driving, drunk driving, and other dangerous maneuvers. Other reports suggest that the pandemic could have added to the problem as people turned to cars as a safer mode of transportation compared to public transport.

While the city and its officials try to tackle the problem, we must also take responsibility for our actions on the road. Whether a driver, walker, or cyclist, we must all follow traffic laws and exercise caution. We should be aware of our surroundings, avoid distractions, and always prioritize safety above all else.

In conclusion, a deadly year on N.Y.C streets should serve as a wake-up call for us all. We cannot afford to become complacent about traffic safety. It is critical to support the initiatives put forward by city officials actively and to remember that our actions have a direct impact on the safety of ourselves and others around us. We must prioritize responsible driving and safe transportation practices, now more than ever, to ensure that pedestrian fatalities and traffic fatalities reduce significantly in the future.
