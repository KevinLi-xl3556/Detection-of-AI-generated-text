Musicians’ Pension Plan Seeks to Cut Benefits: The New York Times

The Musicians’ Pension Plan (MPP), one of the largest pension plans for musicians in the United States, is seeking to cut benefits for some of its members. The plan, which provides retirement, disability, and death benefits for thousands of musicians, has been struggling with financial difficulties for several years. The MPP was established in 1959 and is administered by the American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund (AFM-EPF).

The AFM-EPF has been grappling with a funding crisis for some time now, with the plan currently facing a projected shortfall of around $4 billion. The plan has been forced to make some tough decisions to address the crisis, and cutting benefits is one of them. The proposed benefit cuts would affect musicians who have already retired or those who are nearing retirement age.

The class of musicians who are expected to be most affected are those who were members before 2010. This group is now facing a potential reduction in their monthly benefits by as much as 26%, which would translate to thousands of dollars in lost income every year. According to the plan's administrators, the proposed cuts are necessary to keep the plan afloat and ensure that it continues to provide benefits to its members.

The MPP has been underfunded for years, with contributions from employers failing to keep up with the rising costs of providing retirement benefits to its members. The fund's investment returns have also been lower than expected, putting additional strain on the plan. As a result, the MPP has been forced to take out loans to pay benefits to its members, adding significant interest charges to the plan's expenses.

The AFM-EPF's board of trustees filed an application with the U.S. Treasury Department in September 2020 seeking to reduce benefits to avert the plan's insolvency. The decision to seek the cutbacks was a difficult one for the trustees, but they believe it was necessary to preserve the plan's solvency and ensure that it can continue to provide benefits to future retirees.

The proposed benefit cuts have not been welcomed by all musicians, and there has been some pushback from current and retired members. The Musicians Union, which represents many of the plan's members, has expressed concern over the cuts, saying that it could be devastating for musicians who rely on the plan for their retirement income.

In conclusion, the Musicians’ Pension Plan is in a precarious financial position, and the proposed benefit cuts are a necessary but unfortunate response to the plan's financial challenges. It is critical that the plan's administrators and stakeholders work together to find a long-term solution to ensure that the plan can continue to provide retirement benefits to musicians across the United States.
