James McAvoy, the Scottish actor known for his outstanding performances in films like X-Men: First Class and Split, has taken on a new challenge. In his latest project, he has transformed into the role of Cyrano, a 17th-century gentleman who is best known for his poetic skills. However, this is no ordinary Cyrano, because McAvoy is also rapping in this performance.

This unique adaptation of Edmond Rostand’s famous play Cyrano de Bergerac is a joint production of The Jamie Lloyd Company and the Playhouse Theatre in London. The play is titled ‘Cyrano de Bergerac: The Musical,’ and it sees James McAvoy taking on the titular role. The show has been written by British writer and lyricist, Anthony Drewe, with music by Stiles and Drewe.

From the moment he appears on stage, James McAvoy captures the audience with his commanding stage presence. He raps his way through Cyrano’s famous speeches and soliloquies with such confidence and panache that it is easy to forget that we are watching a play from the 17th century.

The lyrics of the songs are clever and witty, filled with wordplay and puns that keep the audience engaged throughout. One particular scene that stands out is when Cyrano’s love interest Roxane (played by Anita-Joy Uwajeh) asks him to describe her in one word. McAvoy’s character replies with an entire rap verse in which he manages to encapsulate Roxane’s beauty and charm.

The play also features fantastic performances by its supporting cast. Eben Figueiredo shines as Christian, the handsome but dull soldier who Cyrano helps woo Roxane. Figueiredo's portrayal of the character is particularly remarkable during the song ‘Dullness,’ in which he hilariously raps about his lack of brains.

Overall, ‘Cyrano de Bergerac: The Musical’ is an excellent production that showcases James McAvoy’s versatility as an actor. The play is a fresh and exciting take on Rostand’s classic work, which stays true to the original text while also adding a modern and engaging twist. The show’s clever lyrics, catchy tunes, and impressive performances make it a must-watch for lovers of theatre and music alike.

In conclusion, James McAvoy’s rapping Cyrano does indeed dazzle with words, and this production is a testament to his immense talent as an actor. The Playhouse Theatre’s production of ‘Cyrano de Bergerac: The Musical’ is a triumph that combines classic literature, music, and an exceptional cast that will leave you feeling thoroughly entertained.
