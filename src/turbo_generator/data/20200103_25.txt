The Middle Ages, also known as the medieval period, spanned from the 5th to the 15th century. During this period, medicine was vastly different from what we know today. Practices were often based on religious beliefs, superstitions, and myths. However, the Middle Ages also saw significant advancements in medicine, paving the way for modern healthcare.

One of the most prominent medical theories during this time was the miasma theory. It stated that diseases were caused by bad air or smells, and thus, physicians often advised people to stay away from swamps and avoid stagnant water. Another prevalent belief was that diseases were caused by imbalances in the body's humors - blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Physicians would diagnose and treat patients based on balancing these humors.

However, the Middle Ages also saw significant progress in medicine. The first medical school, Salerno School of Medicine, was established in the 9th century in southern Italy. Medical knowledge was recorded in books, and physicians were encouraged to read them and share their knowledge. Herbs and natural remedies were widely used to treat diseases, and many have been found to have medicinal properties.

Surgery, too, saw significant progress during the Middle Ages. Though crude, physicians were able to perform simple procedures such as amputations and trepannings (drilling holes in the skull), often without anesthesia. The use of antiseptics and anesthesia wasn't widespread until much later.

One of the most significant contributors to medical knowledge during the Middle Ages was Avicenna, also known as Ibn Sina. He was a Persian physician and philosopher who wrote many medical texts, including the famous Canon of Medicine. This book was used as a medical textbook until the 17th century and helped standardize medical practices.

In conclusion, medicine during the Middle Ages was vastly different from modern medicine, with many practices based on superstitious beliefs. However, it was also a time of significant progress, with many physicians contributing to the medical knowledge that paved the way for modern healthcare. The Middle Ages were a vital stepping stone in the evolution of medicine, and we owe much of our medical progress to the knowledge gained during this time.
