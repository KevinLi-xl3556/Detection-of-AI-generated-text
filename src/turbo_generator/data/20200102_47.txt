SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, has built a vast empire on the back of its tech investments. But it seems that not all of its portfolio companies have been thriving under the guiding hand of SoftBank.

Recent reports published in The New York Times have exposed a toxic culture and troubling incidents at one of SoftBank's crown jewels in India: Oyo Rooms.

Oyo is a budget hotel aggregator that uses technology to offer rooms at affordable prices. It has received more than $1.5 billion from SoftBank and has been hailed as one of SoftBank's biggest successes. However, according to the report, Oyo's rapid expansion has come at a high cost.

The article cites interviews with current and former employees who describe a work environment that is rife with harassment, employee burnout, and an excessive focus on growth at any cost. One former employee described the company as a "sweatshop."

The report also details troubling incidents in which hotel owners have accused Oyo of deceptive practices and non-payment of fees. In some cases, hotel owners have taken their complaints to court.

Perhaps most surprising is the fact that SoftBank apparently turned a blind eye to these issues. The company's founder and CEO, Masayoshi Son, has been a vocal proponent of the importance of corporate culture and has been known to fire senior executives for perceived ethical lapses.

Yet, according to the report, SoftBank continued to pour money into Oyo even as the allegations mounted. This raises questions about the company's commitment to ethical business practices and its willingness to prioritize profits over people.

In response, Oyo has issued a statement saying that it takes the allegations seriously and will investigate them thoroughly. The company has also announced that it will create an internal complaints committee and hire an independent ombudsman to ensure that employees have a safe and respectful workplace.

This may be a step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen whether SoftBank and Oyo will take more decisive action to address the root causes of these issues. The report serves as a reminder that no amount of money or prestige can entirely paper over a toxic culture or questionable business practices. It is up to SoftBank and Oyo to take responsibility for the actions of their employees and work to build a culture of transparency and accountability.
