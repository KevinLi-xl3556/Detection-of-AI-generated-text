What to Know About Taiwan’s Presidential Election

Taiwan is a highly democratic country, with vibrant political parties and a diverse electorate. The country’s presidential election is one of the most closely watched around the world, with implications for not just Taiwan but also the greater region.

On January 11, 2020, Taiwan will hold its presidential and legislative elections. For those unfamiliar with Taiwan’s politics, here are some key things to know about the upcoming election.

The Candidates

There are three major candidates running for president: incumbent Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party, Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party, and James Soong of the People First Party. Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking a second term, is considered the favorite to win.

Tsai is known for her pro-Taiwan stance and is strongly committed to Taiwanese sovereignty. Han Kuo-yu, on the other hand, has forged closer ties with China and is seen as being more willing to compromise on issues related to cross-strait relations.

James Soong is a veteran politician who has run for president several times in the past. He is known for his pro-business stance and has been critical of both Tsai and Han.

The Issues

The main issues in the election are Taiwan’s relationship with China, economic growth, and social issues such as marriage equality and gender equality.

Taiwan’s relationship with China has been a contentious issue for decades. China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take control of the island. Taiwan, on the other hand, considers itself to be an independent country and has resisted China’s efforts to exert influence.

Economic growth is also a major issue, with both candidates promising to boost Taiwan’s economy. Taiwan has been hit hard by the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, and the country is looking for ways to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on China.

Social issues such as marriage equality and gender equality have also been hotly debated during the election. Tsai Ing-wen has been a strong advocate for both, while Han Kuo-yu has been more conservative on these issues.

Regional Implications

The outcome of Taiwan’s presidential election will have implications not just for Taiwan, but also for the greater region.

China will be closely watching the election, given its interest in Taiwan’s future. A Tsai Ing-wen victory could further strain relations between Taiwan and China, while a Han Kuo-yu victory could lead to more cooperation between the two countries.

The United States will also be watching the election carefully, given its strong alliance with Taiwan. A Tsai Ing-wen victory would likely be seen as a positive development by the United States, while a Han Kuo-yu victory could lead to more pressure from China on the United States to reduce its support for Taiwan.

Conclusion

Taiwan’s presidential election is shaping up to be a closely contested race with significant regional implications. The outcome of the election will depend on a variety of factors, including voter turnout, economic conditions, and the ability of the candidates to appeal to different segments of the electorate.

For those interested in learning more about Taiwan’s politics, the upcoming election is a great opportunity to do so. It will be fascinating to see how things play out and what the future holds for Taiwan and the region as a whole.
