"Afterward," a new documentary directed by Ofra Bloch, is an exploration of the filmmaker's own identity as a Jewish woman and how it intersects with Israel and the Palestinian territories. As she travels to Germany, Israel, and Palestine, Bloch interviews individuals who have experienced trauma and violence due to conflicts between Jews and Palestinians.

The documentary asks important questions about the relationship between Israel, the Jewish diaspora, and the Palestinian territories. It touches on issues such as the power of memory, the importance of reconciliation, and the role of trauma in shaping our identities.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film is Bloch’s own position as a Jewish woman who struggles with the concept of Zionism and what it means for both Jews and Palestinians. She interviews fellow Jews, Palestinians, and Germans to gain insight into their perspectives and opinions, and tries to explore the complex and often-conflicting beliefs and experiences that shape these individuals' understanding of the conflict.

The film highlights how difficult it can be for people to forge connections across divides. Bloch’s experience with her own identity is a case in point. She grew up in Israel, served in the Israeli army, and now lives in New York. These different elements of her background have given her a complex identity which can be difficult to reconcile at times.

The documentary is important for many reasons, but one of the most significant is the way that it invites discussion about Israel and Palestine from a place of respectful curiosity. It is a reminder that we can learn so much from those who have lived through periods of conflict. We can learn from their experiences and from their insights into how to move forward.

Despite some criticisms of the documentary for being unbalanced and not giving equal space to Jews and Palestinians, overall it is a brave and accurate exploration of a contentious issue. It encourages individuals from all sides of the conflict to reflect upon how their own experiences have shaped their understanding of the situation.

In conclusion, "Afterward" is an important documentary that asks vital questions about the complex relationship between Jews, Israel, and the Palestinian territories. It is well worth watching for anyone grappling with their own identities or seeking to gain insight into the broader political and social issues facing the world today.
