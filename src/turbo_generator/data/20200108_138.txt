In recent times, New York has witnessed a surge in anti-Semitic activities that have caused widespread concern among the state and the country at large. As a response, the state of New York passed a new bail law in 2019, which promised to reduce the economic burden on underprivileged individuals and minimize the chances of overcrowding in jails.

However, since the law's implementation, it has come under severe criticism from various quarters, arguing that it has instead put the safety of the public at risk. Under the new law, judges cannot require cash bail or remand suspects in custody for misdemeanours and even some non-violent felonies.

Critics argue that this new bail law has led to an increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes, with brazen perpetrators feeling emboldened and quickly returning to the streets after arrest, posing a considerable threat to the affected community. Recent statistics have revealed that anti-Semitic hate crimes recorded a staggering 26% surge from 2018 to 2019 in New York City, the highest it has been in two decades.

In response, Mayor Bill de Blasio and other lawmakers have sought urgent changes to the current structure of the bail law, calling for the introduction of dangerousness as a concept in determining bail eligibility. This would give judges the power to evaluate the suspect's likelihood of committing further offences before granting bail.

On the other hand, supporters of the bail-law change argue that the law's intention is not to make New York City less safe, but to ensure that pre-trial detention is a measure of last resort. The law aims to provide economic opportunity and equal treatment to all citizens by preventing the detaining of individuals solely because of their inability to meet bail conditions.

Furthermore, they argue that punishing those accused of crimes before they are found guilty is a violation of their constitutional rights. There have been instances in the past where people who could not afford bail have spent months and even years in detention centres, awaiting trial.

Despite the opposing views on this new bail law, it is essential to maintain a balance between preserving the rights of accused individuals and ensuring public safety. The state government needs to take a more holistic approach to address the criminal justice system's deficiencies to prevent future incidents while upholding the ideals of fairness and justice.
