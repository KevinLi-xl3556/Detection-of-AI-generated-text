Malkovich's vast experience as an actor and his unique approach to his craft are sure to bring a lot of depth to the character of Pope John Paul III. Fans of the show can look forward to seeing the two popes in action and what kind of dynamic will develop between them.

In conclusion, Malkovich's casting in 'The New Pope' has been a welcome surprise for fans of the show. His presence is sure to add a new layer of complexity to the already multi-faceted series.
