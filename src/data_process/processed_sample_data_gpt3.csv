(Even Kean’s 8-year-old daughter, Sofia, sometimes consults on runway soundtracks.) The house is also known for trademarks that include a lust for travel and an eye for jewel tones and florid patterns — especially paisley. But for Etro’s fall 2020 men’s wear show in Milan last weekend, Kean paid particular attention to ancestry, weaving together influences from his Italian heritage and from Argentina, where his wife, Constanza Cavalli Etro, grew up. This synthesis showed up throughout the collection: One model strode down the runway in a jacket that was half leather motorcycle and half wool blanket worn over an ocher turtleneck, while the closing look featured a fringed cape adorned with delicate silver embroidery.

"No truly accomplished New Testament scholar, for instance, believes that later Christianity’s opulent mythology of God’s eternal torture chamber is clearly present in the scriptural texts. It’s entirely absent from St. Paul’s writings; the only eschatological fire he ever mentions brings salvation to those whom it tries (1 Corinthians 3:15). Neither is it found in the other New Testament epistles, or in any extant documents (like the Didache) from the earliest post-apostolic period. There are a few terrible, surreal, allegorical images of judgment in the Book of Revelation, but nothing that, properly read, yields a clear doctrine of eternal torment. Even the frightening language used by Jesus in the Gospels, when read in the original Greek, fails to deliver the infernal dogmas we casually assume to be there.",0,5,25.6,34.717948717948715,6.329839703600478

The screenplay is based on an actual 2015 incident in which John Smith, a Missouri teenager, fell through the frozen surface of a lake and remained submerged long enough for his heart to stop. It started pumping blood again after he was brought to a hospital — but reportedly only when his mother audibly prayed for him. That event and the community’s subsequent push to aid in John’s recovery are at the center of this movie, which follows John (Marcel Ruiz), his mother (Chrissy Metz) and father (Josh Lucas) and a young pastor (Topher Grace). The film “tells the story of John’s miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization,” Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The New York Times. Though faith is ever-present, he added, “the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it.”",0,8,25.875,36.71836734693878,6.7557055037573095

"Hugo, 43, grew up at the tail end of apartheid, witnessing South Africa’s sweeping sociopolitical changes in the early 1990s. “Transition from one system to another left an impression and transformed me,” he says. “Everything I saw was mediated by some power, so I wanted to see for myself, and photography was the perfect tool for my wanderlust.” For more than a decade, he has been traveling the world, from China to Ghana to Nigeria, capturing images that illustrate the disorder and humility of life everywhere. He presents the results in series such as “Nollywood” (2009), for which he staged surreal versions of typical scenes from Nigerian movies, and “1994” (2016), for which he photographed children born after 1994, the year that signified the end of apartheid in South Africa and the genocide in Rwanda. He also shoots for magazines including T. He acknowledges that being a photographer grants him unique access to his subjects’ lives but, he adds, “it’s about what we do with that access.” He references Diane Arbus’s view that an artist must allow herself to be an outsider, a status he identifies with whether he’s in Cape Town or in the bedroom of a stranger in Juárez.

"EYES WIDE SHUT (1999) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Despite being analyzed over and over again since its release, Stanley Kubrick’s final film remains stubbornly enigmatic. Tom Cruise plays Bill Harford, a doctor whose patients include some of New York City’s most elite citizens. After finding out that his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) once considered having an affair with a naval officer she encountered on vacation, Bill has a series of strange experiences. The most notable of these occurs at a clandestine gathering he sneaks into at a suburban mansion. Bill’s unauthorized presence is discovered and he’s ejected but not before witnessing the beginning of what appears to be a ritualized orgy held by a secret society. The film’s stilted acting, elliptical plot and surfeit of symbolism make its messages difficult to pin down. But like an intense dream, it’s hard to escape the feeling that something important is being conveyed through the confusion.",0,9,17.88888888888889,86.79896907216495,6.6994782909943185

Because these are the modern bogeymen of urban Mexico.

And they know from talking to one another that there’s a hierarchy of danger, that some families are at greater risk than others. So although Luca never saw the least scrap of evidence of that risk from his parents, even though they demonstrated their courage impeccably before their son, he knew—he knew this day would come.

"Harding, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, has long observed in her own practice that illness alone is not a predictor of outcome. There are reams of studies about stressors and hormonal changes in the body with illness, but many boil down to this: Are you alone when you’re sick, or do you have people sending you flowers and bringing you magazines? If you do, you’re going to get better faster. (There was even a study showing that nature makes a difference: Patients with the same illness in the same hospital who look out on trees versus looking out on a brick wall went home a day earlier.) Harding goes on to show how our interconnectedness helps us stay healthier. By the time she got to this piece of advice I couldn’t help tearing up: “If you see a person on the street asking for money, offer her a snack or water. Ask her name.

There’s a video on the agency’s website that documents the creation of ‘‘the world’s first song scientifically proven to make babies happy.’’ During a monthslong testing period, the team — which included both a developmental and a musical psychologist — asked British parents to tell them which sounds made their infants happiest. They then gathered recordings of the most popular of these sounds, which they tested on actual babies, measuring heart rates and facial expressions and vocalizations. The video includes footage of babies wired up to heart monitors, as scientists pore over complicated-looking data-modeling software.

"Ever the showman, Gaultier opened with a sequence of black-clad mourners and pallbearers who carried a studded coffin as Boy George sang Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black.” The model Karlie Kloss then opened the coffin to reveal the first of the show’s more than 200 looks: inside was a model wearing a white baby-doll dress. A diverse lineup of Gaultier’s favorite muses from every era followed, including the Spanish actress Rossy de Palma, the French filmmaker and model Farida Khelfa, the French model and singer Amanda Lear, the American burlesque performer Dita von Teese and the Canadian model Coco Rocha, who replicated the Celtic jig she performed for the house’s fall 2007 show. The procession, which lasted over an hour, was broken down into sections that showcased Gaultier’s greatest hits: men in skirts, his beloved Breton stripes, trompe l’oeil, corsetry, underwear-as-outerwear. For the finale, the cast gathered to carry Gaultier aloft while Boy George sang Culture Club’s “Church of the Poisoned Mind.” What could have been a maudlin affair was instead a joyous celebration of not only Gaultier’s legacy, but also couture’s enduring ability to make us dream.",0,4,47.0,82.6,6.6408483670240885

"Yet learning about Vert culture is essential for understanding “The Heap,” because what Adams is after is a kind of exploration of communal life. Despite their seclusion, the skyscraper’s residents did not devolve into the anarchic violence of J. G. Ballard’s masterpiece “High Rise.” Instead they allowed the particulars of their unusual existence to subsume their identity. This is why they cannot move on, why they came together to write a grimly nostalgic memoir. Gradually we come to see that the same is true for the community working on the Dig Effort. They have developed insider slang (their nightspot is “The Bars”; their administrative sector “The Ass”; their own community “CamperTown”), and departures are so rare they can be tracked in a printed log. While it’s true that they are essentially dupes, lured by the noble ruse of rescuing Bernard into cleaning up a billionaire’s mess, Adams avoids passing judgment. Humans have bonded over sillier stuff than this. We live in an age where like-minded communities are a given, where individuals use their love for a movie franchise or a pop singer to define themselves, how they ought to exist in the world. The novel’s concern is not the instinct to form groups, but what people do within them. Its characters — Orville and his friends, as well as the villains arrayed against them — suffer because of their idiosyncratic flaws and choices. They manipulate, scheme and consolidate power. But they also care, love and sacrifice. The suggestion is of a lingering quality to human nature. Whether clustered in a vertical utopia or scavenging its collapse, people, for better or for worse — and in “The Heap” it is frequently the latter — will always act like people.",0,14,20.571428571428573,85.95626822157435,6.996492792452678

"If romance novels are wish fulfillment, Lyssa Kay Adams’s THE BROMANCE BOOK CLUB (339 pp., Berkley, paper, $16) takes things to a new, very meta level, centering a series on a group of men who read romance novels to learn how to improve their relationships with women. A pro baseball player named Gavin is welcomed into this secretive cabal when his friends find out his wife has asked for a divorce. What he can’t bear to tell them is why: He recently discovered that Thea has been faking her orgasms for their entire marriage, and while that’s not a reason to end a marriage, the way Gavin handled the news (poorly, angrily) might be. Gavin’s bros assign him a historical romance novel starring the seventh Earl of Latford as a text to study (it’s also spliced into Adams’s book) and they talk him through adapting and implementing what he reads. Of course, this works beautifully: Romance novel heroes know to listen to their partners, work to perceive and fulfill their needs, and express emotion vulnerably and honestly. And of course it’s going to backfire: He’s Cyrano-ing her with a book! Wish fulfillment is never as simple as it seems. But nothing about Adams’s novel is simple, as it unfurls its catchy premise with surprising wisdom and specificity. The earl’s moves allow Gavin to access a new bravery with Thea, which is far more meaningful than any new techniques in bed. The club helps Gavin see not only his own mistakes, but also those Thea needs to work through and resolve herself. This is a lovely and sweet story, an honest and hopeful portrayal of the hard work of marriage.",0,11,25.363636363636363,102.91369047619048,6.938745816539209

A symbol of American hegemony had turned overnight into a symbol of another kind: of hubris, intelligence failure, overreach. Predictably, international markets panicked. The dollar fell, and gasoline prices spiked by 70 percent. This came on top of previous oil shocks that raised prices by a factor of five.",0,6,15.666666666666666,46.88990825688074,5.7940484581036715

"‘ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER’ at the Neue Galerie (through Jan. 13). You could be forgiven for drawing a connection between Kirchner’s shocking color palette and his character. It would be understandable enough, considering his problems with morphine, Veronal and absinthe; the nervous breakdown precipitated by his artillery training in World War I; and his suicide in 1938, at the age of 58, after the Nazis had denounced him as a degenerate. But to linger on Kirchner’s lurid biography would be unfair to the mesmerizing technical genius of his style, amply on display in this exhibition. Surrounding more or less sober portrait subjects with backgrounds of flat but brilliant color, as Kirchner did, wasn’t just a youthful revolt against the staid academic painting he grew up with. It was also an ingenious way to articulate subjective experience in an increasingly materialist modern world. (Heinrich)",0,7,20.285714285714285,30.319526627218934,6.567684170303041

Others think that microtargeting allows the powerful to plant millions of lies in the specific ears of the those who are easy to manipulate.
