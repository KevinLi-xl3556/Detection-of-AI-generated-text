The insurance man said we would be reimbursed for that. You know, I mean insurance company are there to help, to protect people. So I didn't have faith in them. I didn't have enough faith to get a refund from them for that. So after I went looking into it and they told me they will reimburse if it was at fault.

"Here is where one of the most amazing aspects about Munchkin becomes apparent. A typical Munchkin dungeon doesn't have much to do with the main plot of the game. If a dungeon is very close to the beginning of the game, it becomes fairly boring. Not because the game is boring, but because the game simply doesn't have anything to offer. The dungeon is just a place for the player to explore for whatever reason. This isn't always the case however, especially in many of the older games where there wasn't a proper story arc before one of the main quest characters arrived to stop the baddies. I mean the story here in Munchkin is much larger than even the early-game plot. While there may not be any main plot involved if they had one, the dungeon could also act as a hub for the game to explore. If you're wondering why I mentioned how storyless games work a lot, you should be asking yourself why games with multiple paths of storyline have no real story in them.",1

"The only true economic driver is competition. But competitive capitalism forces a human element more than the mechanics of earning money plus cash dividends. Most people talk about competition from the very beginning of capitalism, when the banks (still owned by private individuals and small businesses) issued increasing amounts of credit to all of society for the provision of business services. This supplied sufficient money for some productive enterprises to earn a business rent that gave them a floor. These rent factories were then able to set labor conditions so as to cause a profit and raise operating costs. After the crisis of 2008, Free Trade Agreement (FTAs) in which the world's economies moved away from investment-based, owner-operated capitalism was ratified, competition was supposed to be the neutral ground from which to strike competitive market terms to implement UK FTAs, and free enterprise principles such as hedonism, laissez faire, social Darwinism and stable commodity markets were theoretically supposed to be repackaged to replace human and rational capital in the delivery of what the country put products upon the exporters markets. But this limited competitive element is increasingly appearing as financial dependent, profit driven, shareholder interest dominant corporations reach large enough to not necessarily limit themselves to shareholder value principles, and inevitably they start accounting rules according to their own financial incentives.",1

"In the 1980s, when I moved to New Jersey, I was struck by this image of an elderly man on his way home from seeing his grandchild, whom he described as having died suddenly at his home. The grandson was apparently sleeping. I was told that there were some things that I must not get distracted by. I was reminded of this image of what I had seen before as we drove through the dark, rainy streets, with a man slumped over in his wheelchair. The man must have had trouble with his wheelchair because he was standing directly in front of us. He had no sign of help or assistance. I took a look at the man. He appeared to have been unconscious for some time and was slumped across on the porch of his own house. As we approached him, the old man looked at us for a moment. He seemed somewhat calm, apparently not quite sure what to do at this point.",1

"The Hooke Effect is a consequence of this movement, where there is a small difference between the direction of the motion and the direction of the load. That is, a particular loading, which is moving with respect to a given force being applied, is going to get progressively more and more unstable as the object moves away from us—or as the Hooke effect goes along. The Hooke Effect is only apparent if the object is already stationary in space, and in order to avoid this effect, all one has to do is do two things very slowly and slowly, without too much movement for the object to even notice. If the object already has a slight momentum differential because of the speed of the object, then it will seem as if there are no significant changes to the object's motion, because it will remain inert to us. But, by doing this, once the Hooke Effect has occurred, the Hooke effect will become the basis for all other ""motion-related"" effects to occur, including the Hooke Effect of gravity.",1

I'm willing to accept the punishment if it is not outweighed by the benefit it produces. However, as a moral and ethical philosopher, I have long found that killing someone on principle seems to me preferable to allowing them to die so that another person can live. In fact, one of the greatest objections to capital punishment I've ever encountered can easily be boiled down to this: Do we want justice to prevail, or does the state have a greater interest in killing innocent people?",1

"There's a Chinese dragon quite commonly referred to in Japan as ikuga. ikuga is easy to miss because it is hard to distinguish from other dragon types. However, it has been protected higher than other Chinese dragons. Several stories reference dragons that were protected by ikugas, ""Oruka Dragons"", so I'll expand on that in another post. In any case, the story above relates to how the same mythical Christian dragon prince protected a defenseless Jewish girl to the point of defeating the powerful Nazca snake gods. A messiah caught up to her the previous night still under ikuga, finally brought her strength to bear and exorcized his powers. She resisted and able to realign her body to human size, used her ikuga then stole Heaven to give the boy power over her dangerous sylvane tribes. The son of the messiah killed Alm. Outside worlds, strangers see the shrakken Sun army Armageddon with a mixture of scorn and worshipful admiration. Yet they still beg their kings to gather arms against the influential Nazca, far more potent to swarm abroad as white chuttering ants. When Armageddon approaches, Christianity must embrace a glorious dark age in the same way invading armies brought nearly obliterating Eastman with stealth.

"It is illegal in Ohio to use pornography in public places unless overt sexual performance. Is that not clear enough? Is that not clear enough? How about the specific rules that pro-homosexuals bend in their fight to continually extort politicians on behalf of their homosexual rights? Because they cannot ever say no to supporters that seek to take advantage of them. It is not up to them to discover the truth. You enact your laws through ballot measures. Well, you do it through laws that are driven by corrupt politicians' fear of losing elections if your laws do not fit ""in line."" Lawmakers are told that the people are all unhappy with the people's attempts at legislation and legislated legislation must be passed to appease those voters at the ballot box. … Republicans and people who voted for Obama considered property destruction as you vetoed $35 million to help eradicate the ""buffer zone,"" but are happy to let government allow God's creation go on, abort babies too cheaply, so that else the mothers with 2-year-old twins can pass on to their children hybridized DNA?

Kasich saves the lives of his crime-fighting partners every day by requiring a convicted murderer to get sex offender treatment.

Storming the governor's mansion is seen as ""breaking the rule of law"" when they force citizens to opt out of their civil duty to vote. You are a religion driven organization. Advanced degree? Law or business? Perhaps your sins include living within your means? Your ledger was abused to allow demographic crimes to happen. Think the video above of political tea partiers haunting ""rape spots"" to take advantage of current voters at the ballot box? Well guess what, my friends? George Romney loves what his wife is up to. His wife likes what she's up to. Perhaps we will have to paint a very nice aura around a suspect male, given that you have systematically violated the election system in multiple states. Animals eat brain after placing females inside them to deny their liberty to do otherwise. Self-defense is not only not authorized, it usually set on fire, suffocating, torture, menacing, defocking, crush, (when you don't like it), shoulder-sprain, create a train by accident, now one made of plastic because you would like to check it out, made of metal because your pick-up truck doesn't work, too! … Instead of just lowering costs for flight, tax breaks are being cooked up through the lure of the district –winged pet carrier should be a place for your children being intimately involved in male-on-male intercourse. Scouts for Jesus will protest next year as you celebrate February 7 by experiencing steep increases after you're given tax breaks that give exorbitant discounts to having adolescent girls guardian prone to being prompted pass tags, permanent ballets and gyms. Keep your nudity up to date (I made our small boy presentable when he grew out his hair). You told us you'd support public school women teaching in their children's classrooms so your wife could give childbirth talks. You must be so pretty with your changing, giving your children full time child care. Keep fulfilling your obligations and seek full employment. If you're a criminal, ""blackened,"" violence victim, former felon or amoral acting out criminal there is punishment enough however long it takes until you get your future passing seems fair. Nothing short of the fullest measure of justice is ever served to anyone. Who are you allowing to continue saying what you want when you want to keep corrupting the system?… The most successful way to leverage minorities to keep one hand busy could be looking at Chicago's urban disenfranchisement and its drift towards an absent urban center, where every Asian gang member and every Mexican child will attend school and play soccer with their parents. Ignoring the fact that you think street fairs are f---ing f---ing freaky nowhere in the city of Israel isn't exactly the stronger strategy.

Beware Idaho and Massachusetts and East Harlem, homophobia sv formulated your pro boasts for despite comprehensive van Colle ordinances were kicked out of dozens of schools where over half the State took no action across the board. A financial help from our close family friends did the illustrated flipping across the middle finger to Mitt Romney for his bare stomach. The fact is, so long as in power the subversive Democrat would not only have to abandon their own majority, you would significantly reduce a candidate's reach over the whole reach factor; garnering enthusiasm from Southern and Midwestern liberal voters from Wyoming and Wisconsin, only to pressure Democratic candidates to flee Michigan and Illinois from a secure, Democratic electoral horizon in Pennsylvania, Missouri, Iowa and Ohio.

"I am a professional painter and I was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease that affects my mental capacities. This is a major crisis for me and I would like an immediate and efficient approach to my treatment. I have been told by my doctor that I have more problems than I was aware of. I would like to think that this is normal and I think that it is. My family and I have tried to find a solution to solve this problem and find a way to live normal lives by spending time with my favorite children and friends. My problem is that at the same time I think that life without them will be hell. It seems that there is no such thing as a normal thing. The children are getting very old and in some cases I was told I will die if I go without them until my health improves. When I think about them, I wish I could be them and I see how it would have been in my teens; with lots of friends and a nice family. I just wish they would have had a place to stay because these days the only thing I want to do in life is talk about all the stuff my boys and I have done because there is nothing left to do. So this is the second time I've gone to the hospital for care. The first time I went for my brain scan it took hours and the third time, about 2 months later, I was asked to go to the emergency room. No one has told me that my brain is deteriorating or why I should be hospitalized. No one explained to me why it might be difficult to accept help and there is no reason to ask me to get the help I want or pay more than I need. I can see that the only thing that will make them understand is to give me a better prognosis. This hospital refuses to provide any sort of treatment plan, I have no idea what that is, or if it is a plan at all. They did not call me for a second opinion but instead sent me around for an examination. I have a family member there and I ask them if they have told me if I should be admitted for treatment. They tell me they have and this seems to be a problem. They did not tell me there was anything wrong with me so there could be one of the reasons. I am a woman and the fact that she says this just makes me worry about it. I thought if there was any hope for my health and life that it would reach one doctor before I saw another. I would like to get treatment, but my situation is that this doctor is far too busy to care for me and my family. It is not only that he has his office located on the 10th floor, but there is literally no way he will be able to treat me because he will be busy and at his desk all day. I have to go to this doctor, or someone close if I want attention and care. Why am I in this situation? Who is making me this way? In one hand, I can give good advice by telling them that I would be happy to get some help and that someone close would take care of themselves. These kinds of advice from a doctor are never enough! But on the other hand, I have to tell them that they should not take it personally and should tell me about the problems in the family and that the children will grow out of it. Is this the best way to handle a problem with Alzheimer's? How much time do I have in a day? I want a permanent solution just a few dollars each. The person at the table thinks if they can fix things here it would be enough at the hospital, but I am not one of those types of people and it feels wrong to ask that person to do that for me. Also I have had to take medication twice now to stop my anxiety and am getting my condition under control so I am no longer in a rush or feeling down. I have never been told anything by this person about what is wrong with me. They are not my doctor, they take my insurance, they take care of my kids, but they are not treating my problems, not treating them.",1

Even if we consider the effect these deleterious transference effects have on speakers, we should get a better understanding on their priority for use and how mistakes like this can make it easier for the grammarian to confirm the truth of grammatical assertions. In addition, I think the information generated by restatements necessarily need to focus on focus on form and tone rather than on outside voices, something that the vast majority of linguists, with the exception of Hellenson, believe just came from childhood.",1

"And this isn't the first time that I can remember a white person telling me that it was worth going to an Ivy League school to learn. But in my experience at UNC-Chapel Hill, I really wasn't the only person who had difficulty understanding this. I really wasn't the only person who had even trouble making the choice to go to an Ivy League school — even though many of us didn't. So, for me to say that I can do it, that I can make the choice that I want to make. I can put my education over anything else, to the point where it gets kind of scary and I end up losing. But even with that reality, things were different for us than for my peers. We always had so much in common because we had lived so, so much of our lives, for so long. We had parents who came from so far away. And you had an academic culture that was as much diverse and as intellectually challenged as the country, because it was so diverse — and as intellectually challenged as the country, we really were able to bridge that gap. When I was going through my transition from a male to an all-white academic life, it made me more aware and much more sensitive, as it didn't feel like I was going to remain the same person as my male twin.",1

He quickly began to put his life into developing programs, from Excel spreadsheets to .Net.

"This tax, which is currently charged to individuals and business for unreimbursed contributions they made to various tax-exempt organizations, is the most unfair and harmful tax reform ever proposed in America. In fact, it was estimated that it would cost at least $4.6 trillion over the next 10 years to fully repeal the tax. This bill repeals the tax completely by eliminating the alternative minimum tax. This means that there is no reason for individuals making over $400,000 plus to pay income taxes on income over that level, but individuals making less than that level (and possibly in some states like New York whose residents do not pay the Alternative Minimum Tax) will owe at least one tax obligation per year. Even for individuals making under $400,000, the Alternative Minimum Tax was supposed to go away in 2016 because this was a last-gasp effort to get our small business tax code on track. This legislation will restore the ""business tax cuts"" to its pre-1979 roots by eliminating the alternative minimum tax, lowering individual income tax rates to 20% and eliminating the estate and gift taxes. The elimination of the Business and Investment Tax in the bill will provide about half, or $400 billion, to spur entrepreneurship and economic growth within the U.S. economy.",1

Thus, he has moved to elevate aspirational hawks past that transition. But Trump is essentially doing exactly what Santorum has done, rather than adding to the position of a candidate who is more suited to the Strange preview gained by a Broader Chopping Block.Trump's total donation is $50,700 on top of $30,000 he has already made for political purposes, including $5,000 last month for a subsidiary of a constant advance What's more, Trump provided only about 20 percent of the donations he reported.",1

[Cohen] understood the danger in that."" This was in an era when newspapers had no real news business. The Sunday pages were largely a blank slate, with newspaper proprietors and their newspapers running with the rest of the news. For decades, the paper had run the occasional piece or two (such as that of a young boy who, out of ""a sense of morality to the best of his abilities,"" walked on an open beach in the White City with his pants undone, naked, and was rescued by a woman), or even just brief snippets.

"In a world of rising prices, soaring rents and a looming debt crisis, one of the most intriguing aspects of these new ways of working is how to survive and thrive on your personal land. There are only so many square feet you can grow and use, and it becomes impossible to keep them all in one place. Even though you are trying to work under these very strict rules, the freedom to move can also be quite liberating. You can do most things with less. For example, you can spend many years building up a nice little garden, growing fruits and vegetables, growing some exotic flowers for your dining table, or even growing your own tea. But how do you do something that you need to do every day so you don't have to worry about your credit report for years to come? Many companies now offer options for this, allowing employees to pick and choose what they want to do, but not having to worry about debt, job safety and a bad loan rating.",1

In one respect, there's an irony in this whole story, although it's only fair to mention that the entire world is already in a state of denial. This article, as well as many others published in The Washington Post this week, are part of a new campaign to rebrand Democratic Party. As in The Washington Post, many of these efforts have been pushed by Hillary Clinton. They're designed to turn the Democratic Party, which was created to give working people a voice in a corrupt corporate class, into a party that stands up for their economic interests. In doing so, this new Democratic Party is making a lot of inroads into traditional Republican strongholds, although, of course, the Republican Party holds the presidency. And just a few weeks ago, some in the Democratic Party decided that a more progressive Democratic platform could turn out to be the solution to the party's problems.

"I had to find a couple of tactics to keep the monsters at bay. One is to make sure that you always switch weapons. This is quite tricky, as switching weapons can leave you vulnerable if the enemy does not see you as an threat. If you have a heavy melee weapon like daggers, then there isn't really much time to avoid being slashed, but it is better to be careful around a shield equipped with shield bash. I also recommend playing with the enemy's ability to move through enemies, but the key to this is understanding what abilities it is able to use.",1

A quick review will show that this woman, the one who is being interviewed by the boss, really is a beauty queen, and the woman has a perfectly natural way of presenting herself that is exactly how she looks -- no facial hair whatsoever. But when the interviewer said, ""Well, she's pretty,"" that made a lot of me cringe. For Hill's character to say that she is really a beauty queen and that she doesn't look like Julia Roberts is crazy. It was such an embarrassing thing to say. But Hill knew he was saying it and laughed at himself, because clearly he knows that this woman does look exactly like Julia Roberts, but does she look great? I can understand why Hill would laugh this when he saw the woman, but there is an important difference between saying this without thinking any further, and saying it out of ignorance and without taking into account what it's like to be judged in these situations.",1

We denote (2) the probability of linearity of each of the points in the system. We do this by first computing the probability of linearity of s as an approximant of n 2 + 1/s 2 , where s is the maximum of each state vector. We then find the best estimate of the probability of linearity of the process under linearity condition n = 1 if we assume a fixed time interval between the points in the system and the system. The algorithm proceeds in a linear manner, for example, taking the mean of the maximum and minimum estimates at each given interval.",1

There are several SD card cameras on the market these days, but there are limits to what you can take with a USB-SD card. SD cards are small, the only reason you'd want one is if a flash is present. You wouldn't want to get one for your mobile phone as it might damage it. You could save money because it will cost less to charge and you don't have to plug to a power source just for storage and charging. You can still get an SD card from your smartphone or tablet with a cheap microUSB-cable to a PC. This camera can be used on a computer and you can simply use the USB-SD slot on the camera to charge the card and make the next shot.",1

"In Iraq, an insurgent group called the Islamic State grew rapidly from a small band of insurgents into a powerful paramilitary force that now controls large portions of that country and the northern region, particularly Iraq's vast desert and oilfields. The American intelligence community had, for years, been studying the group's plans and plotting the attacks needed to defeat it. But nothing had been done. It was clear, however, that the ""red line"" had been crossed, and in August 2001, when the Pentagon was finally willing to make action against ISIS a top priority, White House lawyer Stephen Hadley, acting deputy attorney general, issued the legal memo outlining exactly what a CIA officer, Colonel Bruce MacFarland, could and couldn't do. But because no one at the highest levels was willing to follow the legal advice—the administration's own military strategy had already been in place to defeat al Qaeda, which was the enemy—there was no action. President Bush, therefore, had to choose his own side. In October 2001, he told his National Security Advisory council that if he thought the war against al Qaeda was over and Iraqi leaders were negotiating a resolution, it was ""time for a full and credible effort to destroy this extremist threat in Iraq."" He ordered the first U.S. ground forces to land in Iraq in March 2002, and when they arrived they had a few months before the elections to get to work, laying the foundation for an American invasion that began two months later. The first assault on al Qaeda in Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom, had begun in 2003, and the invasion was far bigger than the first time around, being, essentially, a proxy conflict between three rival groups in Syria. But the Americans had been able to keep from entering the country. In early January 2004, Iraq's new government, led by Abadi, finally agreed to accept the American military as a partner, allowing them to begin military operations on March 14, 2004. For the first time, an invasion into Iraq took place on a large scale, and it came with all the consequences of the past: the burning of American planes, the discovery of chemical weapons, the deployment of U.S. artillery, the killing of hundreds of Americans and counting of Iraqi and Kurdish fighters, and the loss of an estimated 3,500 lives and an untold number of lives of Iraqis. The United States lost its reputation as the world's ""great power"" by becoming, in Iraq, the world's most hated ""terrorist state"" and being the main enemy of the United States.",1

"The answer to this question is yes. Even though Katy Perry's ""Roar"" is an acoustic acoustic guitar, it's not.  Not technically. It's an acoustic guitar, in that it is, in effect, sounding like a guitar. It is, therefore, not an instrument. It can be played the way it is or not. But there's a lot to do with it. For starters, there is not much difference if the guitar has a set neck neck, a fretsome (that is, semi-dominant) neck, or an extra long string (see my other post on which neck to choose for electric guitars ). What Katy's acoustic instrument is supposed to do is allow for the playing of all kinds of tone curves - harmonic, chromatic, and vibrato. All of the different sounds that her performance does is accomplished through the instrument, which is to say, through a whole spectrum, not one discrete sound. That's why in this particular performance a lot of the harmonic stuff, for example, seemed to be going exactly where it should. At times you could almost feel that you were on the guitar playing something real, or something close to real, on that acoustic guitar, not listening to an entire band being played live. Even within these limited moments, though, you could almost feel that you were listening to real instruments. Even the instrument was moving, and not just a sort of floating noise floating through space. One of the things that I really like about Katy's style is that it doesn't really try and do something special. It's all about the fact that she sounds like this. She has the perfect voice for the music. She's never had a particular career goal. She has just been doing what she does. Katy, I know that you've been in various bands and you've been performing and written songs that are catchy and catchy (though, unfortunately, none of these have ever gotten any mainstream distribution) but",1

They got their start in the Family Research Council (FRC), which works to turn children into hard-line anti-gay activists, but is now funded by most right-wing money groups and the Koch brothers. This coalition includes the Koch brothers themselves, who as the leader of the Liberty Institute, created their own anti-gay super-PAC, America's Voice. But even before the Liberty Institute's 2012 mission statement, the FRC was the target of attacks on a scale unprecedented in American history. As I write this article, we are seeing one of the most dramatic battles the GOP's religious bases face yet in 2012.

In March, the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) filed suit against the FRC for using ""hate speech"" or ""insulting words against the First Amendment by its ""religious liberty"" language in two of its religious-freedom bills, claiming that their religious-free language ""promotes intolerance, hostility, intolerance and bigotry.""",1

"The prospect of adding a third team to MLS has drawn support from big names, who have named 6 MLS teams. Though No. 6 is only one league away, which may seem like an insignificant difference between a viable expansion team and the sixth—New York Red Bulls owner Chris Hansen supporters, for example—as an installment of an expansion franchise will be widely viewed in Los Angeles with ever greater fan interest. Both the club and MLS will have to produce as development is handed out this offseason with return on investment at each of the three later phases of spending needed to grow the league. Not only will each club face the challenge of drawing the interest of new fans in MLS over the coming years, but this plan was one of the two proposed expansion packages evaluated by MLS last week which has provided an explanation why the same number of teams has been mentioned on exactly the same topic. The impact of these three expansion proposals placed into play by MLS and the Board of Governors in their September 17-19 annual meeting pales in comparison to the benefits gained from investing in the league and reaching an agreement with six separate teams. The ramifications at each of the expansion proposals cited by DC United supporters outnumbered those by 2-1 each.

"CHENNAI: The Karnataka government has let go of a contract taking care of maintenance for the toll road in Mahabanagar district to improve associated traffic flow. The project plans for road widening were submitted in 2012 and preparations for road construction had commenced in 2013. But former deputy CM of the state NRA Munashekar UK/Temporary Division 19 C D Gopalaya said that road widening would not start in Karnataka for some time due to complications with Indian execs refusing to give financial support of public purse. India is yet to sanction road widening through India Economic Corridor which India has opposed.Gopalaya said the treasury ministry has not sanctioned any funds for road widening through India Economic Corridor. ""For donations from the citizenry under the road scheme this year, it depends mostly on private donations. So far I have received small donations from other crore-dollar individuals. So there is a short gap between the start of funding of road widening provided here and completion of such funding,"" he explained.""There is probably no direct revenue flow from this project at my mandates. Varanasi-Delhi-Maharashtra can no longer divide up the state...our GST growth depends on these networks. The losses will be borne by Karnataka...this requires MCDs to operate government programs in Karnataka too,"" the DC said.Gopalaya continued that Karnataka government's proposal for building and maintenance of the international gateway of Hampshire tap into its antipathy towards US initiatives towards building a bridge in India whose construction is contingent on US approval.

"So, how much, actually, would one have to lose for us to understand this fundamental human reality? Well, for an anthropologist this means that we have to become quite sure about who we are – in fact that we have to be quite sure about who we are. It means that we have to start studying our own internal dynamics before we can understand our fellow man – we can't just assume that the same evolutionary path leads us to different values, different social systems and different cultural contexts. There are reasons that humans, who evolved with our social systems, often don't want to cooperate with outsiders in social settings. It isn't clear if this means a lack of 'interaction' or if it points simply to social evolution having produced certain features that would have made it better for one individual to have higher levels of success and higher levels of empathy. For example, people may be less likely than those without the same kinds of social systems to trust the motives of others, if it means a lower level of cooperation overall, or simply less of it. This may explain why there are so many different kinds of people in each species. But we shouldn't lose sight of that basic truth either.",1

One species that is more common than the yellowtail is the greengill. Greengill populations in the lower mainland have swelled so drastically in recent years that some people believe the species is now thriving in the wild, perhaps because some of the greengill killed by the yellowtail are also caught for sushi.",1

"To ensure that all users have access to fair, competitive and reliable Internet service, the Commission is committed to encouraging Internet entrepreneurs and businesses to invest in networks that support innovation and jobs. The Commission has previously stated that the Internet has the potential to play a leading role in economic growth. This means that there needs to be strong and open access for our online and off-line commerce, investment and employment — the Internet and Internet infrastructure are two of the pillars of economic growth, and must be treated equally by Internet service providers and all customers. The Commission's policy on the Internet undergirds this objective. Under the Commission's plan, Internet service providers that reach more Americans, such as ISPs that deliver service to their customers, should be able to set their own network prioritization policies — such as what is called the ""flexible network approach"" — within an established net neutrality framework. This could allow them to provide consumers with better experience and faster connections, to meet the goals of competition and provide better service at reasonable and transparent prices to online consumers and content providers, and serve the needs of current and future consumers. This approach could give Internet service providers more market power that a provider that is a monopoly. However, it can also mean that a service provider that is required to make decisions that disadvantage all users and slow down connections for some in order to benefit a few can still be able to charge different prices and deliver the same service at lower speeds to customers with varying means. This does not mean that all Americans should be served equally within the network, or that it should be impossible to provide a particular experience to customers who cannot afford basic broadband internet. By ensuring that all Internet users have access to equal service, the FCC is ensuring that Internet innovators and businesses, and businesses and companies of all sizes, have equal access to the Internet, and to the benefits promised by broadband investments throughout the public and private economies of every country that has built up the Internet. Under the plan, a service provider might charge an unbundled user that service (like those without broadband connections) significantly more than an unbundled user that is able to pay for full Internet access, or a connection with strong network management.",1

"The government of India has approved the first shipment of 500m tons of grain since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2015.The grains will be delivered by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) and will be supplied to the rural poor through a scheme. These grains will be sold through a small company called Patna Food Marketing Pvt. Ltd. Patna is the state capital of Bihar and it is also one of the eight states in the centralised GST-I structure.The decision follows a visit to Bihar by Union Agriculture Minister Haribhai Parrikar, which saw several small-holder farmers across the state. The Patna food marketing unit, which has more than 6,000 farmers, has come together during the last few months for a farmers' rally.The state government has decided to provide subsidies of Rs 100 per hectare (h) for each kg of grain collected from the farmer and Rs 35 per kg collected from government agencies. The grains will be packaged in the form of two-litre containers, worth Rs 300, while one-litre containers will cost Rs 90.""India has made it mandatory to offer subsidies and this is to boost the supply,"" Parrikar said. ""A lot of rural farmers are waiting for a subsidy. We have to be bold and we have to provide them with a chance of getting a subsidy in the market.""The state government has sought approval from the Centre to allow the sale of this grain via its farmers' group Patna Food Marketing Pvt. Ltd on the basis of ""pradhan scheme"". ""This will help in raising the standard of life of farmers in the state, and this would also help in providing them with jobs,'' the Centre's agriculture secretary Prakash Javadekar told news agency ANI, adding that it is also a matter of priority that the state has a minimum standard of living.He, however, did not have any details on how much subsidy would be granted to Patna Food Marketing Group. ""There will be a minimum payment for both the supply and for distribution of grains,"" said Javadkar, adding that each kg of grain should be priced at Rs. 200, and that payments should be made within a month of receipt of the shipment by the centre.The price of one unit of fresh wheat will cost Rs 1,500 ($1.6). The price of one unit of corn, rice and other agricultural crops will cost Rs 1,000 ($1.1), 2,500 ($1.3), 7,500 ($1.4) and nine units of grains should cost Rs 4,000 ($2.9). These prices are similar to the prices that would be charged for fresh rice or wheat.The Food Corporation of India will be purchasing 1,300kg of wheat each month through a ""pradhan scheme"". Under the scheme, it will take up to 10% of the produce required for distribution to rural people. The Centre is also providing Rs 2,000 per unit from state monies on behalf of FCI in case of shortage.The state government has already paid off all funds paid by the Centre to banks, farmers' associations and foodgrain traders over the years and the Centre has extended the help through the subsidy programme.",1

However, the types of electrical equipment usually on display at the sales counter are not, as a manufacturer might normally expect, electrical parts of equal quality, such as a computer or other wireless device connected to a wireless network. This requires the product buyer to consider not only the total cost of the assembly work, but also the time that must be invested in the necessary steps during assembly. Therefore, it is essential that sellers and buyers understand the specific requirements of each item of electrical equipment they sell, such as what parts are included in the purchase, if any parts are available at additional costs, and whether warranties are applicable to the equipment.",1

"6 Clean Voting Rights Case in Wisconsin's GOP-GOP Senate Race With Voting Rights Advocate Mark Schierbecker, ACLU Voting Rights Project legal staff lead Emily Green and voting rights expert Marc Ash explain how voting rights advocates took center stage in Wisconsin's tight 2016 Republican House races to defend a voter ID law in the wake of a Justice Department review that found it may discriminate against minority voters. On the Democratic side, U.S. Attorney Lisa Madigan's electioneering commission case against Secretary of State Brad Schimel was an early test of that case, which is expected to ultimately decide if Schimel's office has the authority to use federal enforcement authority to prevent voters from casting provisional ballots; if the appeal is successful, Schimel could lose his state's general election. In the last few weeks, Democrats on both sides of the aisle have urged lawmakers to back reforms in Wisconsin's voter ID laws. And if a key Republican voter ID law is struck down or invalidated, as expected, the Justice Department could decide to take a second look at other laws that target minorities. Meanwhile, Justice Department officials have signaled that they might issue a ""preposterous"" challenge to the integrity of a judge's decision not to charge Schumel in the state voter purge case that could have implications for more election cases.

If you've not seen the progress over this time, you really should, because it's pretty much the only way to gain much more info about your device's build process and to keep track of which ones are new and which are old. This thread and its build notes are a collection of my progress over the past year, along with the builds that have not shown up yet and that I still need to test or work on before they are posted here.I amNexus 7.0. But I don't mean that as in ""this is the complete Nexus 6"", because I think the last 3 ""6"" devices have improved on these builds quite a bit in just a few cases, but that's more of a reflection of my device's hardware. So this post has no ""best"" or ""worst"" builds.There is much more to understand about these builds than what I am willing to share here. But that is the intention. So I hope to help those who care about devices.

It was only announced in November and was released just three days after my 5th device came out...It doesn't seem as obvious and there are some similarities between the 2.

"Here's where I come into this. I'm one of the people who have been using Spotlight for a very lengthy time as someone who likes to be able to quickly search across a large number of resources. Because this search feature works with an iPad on a very high resolution screen, the app can display a much bigger preview of your results in comparison with the default option, which makes it easier for me to find what I'm looking for quickly. My experience was that there was a lot more reading material within a single line of search suggestions in the search screen, and I'm no longer able to do this quickly and efficiently by just opening the app just to look through what I type in, which makes the search function feel even more clumsy for people with large screen imaginations. Even searching on a mobile with a low resolution screen like iPhone 7 or iPad Air, my experience with Spotlight is still far closer to just looking through the search results on an iPad when I'm reading. One of the biggest problems with the app is that a large number of users in that space use a mouse in order to navigate through what they search for quickly and effectively, and the default navigation on a mouse-based interface is frustrating for these users.",1

Some tall women will also look for partners who are tall enough that her own height puts her over 1/4 to 1/2 inch shorter, and if a taller guy is available to meet her, this can come across as a relationship.

Meanwhile, the jobless rate fell to 7.9%, its lowest since September 2006. The unemployment rate was near 10% in February, its lowest level in two years. In addition, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of nearly 12% of the labor force aged 16 to 24 in October 2016.

"Previously this month, we had proof that JavaScript can be just as handy to programs as could be code. JavaScript contractors trapped in healthy libraries experienced some incredible debugging tools. Of course, another part of the proof came from presentations by the two Open Source guys lead in the JS community — Jeffrey Thompson and Adam Emmat — described twice the effects of JavaScript. In particular, JavaScript debugging tools like Closure Compiler Ecosystems like Node and Amber, etc reduce haddock code to readable files. If you don't already have the Node.js NODE_ENV_HASH gene, no doubt some studying of the book Micropeoples by Norman Clark will teach you the respective functions and variables of everything in JavaScript. For those eager to learn even more about how JavaScript works, Math.Color makes colors specific to target sets of colors. Let's look at Node.js's color management functionality. Instead of using the aura.js color plugins, Node chose to expose a provided singleton from the Skeleton library. By providing this singleton, Node has effectively implemented all of CSS rendering by Node.js. This enables anyone calling sdk.call() , like in less-is-more practice, without having to write custom CSS colors. By using Universal Colors, thanks to Trent Neary's variable-color node binding, SVG, PNG and all conventional image formats now display this singleton distinguishing images that need consistent color, Dave bought official names for Ragdoll. The amazing work of Brad Audenshine during Functional Programming with Predictive Machines in this example function later demonstrated how prog.tree() would give us an arbitrarily predictable scanned set of tags. Intel clearly showed how easily and readily the quadraphing algorithm would find and chop the data into a generalized graph of sequences of points. The practical implementation of this was explained in lots and lots of really important but unknown details. In general, it has been perfectly smooth and simple to write garbage collection ideas in JavaScript. Other languages shapeshift away from such techniques, even in frameworks shared by the same API. While for example anything ever the same while fading into a two verb sentence could be observed in the language, the code would be almost as complex as forfor , but as the compiler compiles code, you get a graded measure of compile time which is what makes publishing modern code easier. In Node.js we now built a nice feature called reactive mode which automates testing any poorly tested project by forcing it on startup, while still providing progress indication and perhaps optionally punishing errors in a supportive way. Debugging in JavaScript makes these things interesting. It requires not only a good line of sight to the code of interest but time and mental discipline to see deeply the consequences of interesting environment, like biomedical vs. graphical hardware designs. For elaborate kilometeromena testing programs, ECMAScript 5 naturally comes with only a few% serious equivalent pieces across all hash tables. Only with ECMAScript 6 can ""let's see always this"" finally be sexy. Other simulation tutorials are subsumed by analysis and experiments in multi-constructor apps with good makefiles. The result if brought under some arbitrary experimental constraints is ultra-good performance and performance consistency in like, the form of big models written by rich oracle systems. In this case ECMAScript v7 JavaScript writers may add access to a pile of prototypes further aided by virtual prototyping tools. 3. Using JavaScript 2.0 Commarians C Raducaul gave an eye-opening look at two scenarios similar to these: small global global objects like functions and variables and large language objects like any DOM element attached to a listener DOM element or platform platform API. These things are the languages that are what expose us to optimizations in javac ipython probe, depending on the platform. Code Size In particular, conflict using invariants has been hampering new C++ implementations since 2005. There are methods from ad-hoc non-camper points leveraging Eastman and C99 voluntary support. However, with the rise of C++14, and accidental signaling tool injection that not only hurt full thread developer but also discourages applications simple and some C++14 *** programming. ThisIn addition, trial feature calls like closures tend the point of weakness. David Buffosso fed us a nice solution for a similar resource none-needless invocation. For an artistic example see the formula returned by Isogin on the closed flipped ledger relying separately on the Alexander Theognes theorem and computational convenience over a code organization and concurrency- and synchronization overhead. Can we avoid one case not currently tested to require a tiny app? Of course. Great note on the prospect of native code jumping the old Shell switching paradigm. Whenever I run src/oneuh/crash in my interactive play, it doesn't crash the app out from shadows. I just outputs an update with sea information onto several `answers' and then more runtime_flood errors and then 'crash' that two second app. The fun doesn't just last an instant. Those failures",1

She finds it very difficult to put her own needs first and has to rely on others to fill in the gaps.

"The world's smallest computer will be made in the UK by a pair of Oxford techs and launched by government in the early weeks of next year.""We've done a lot of research with people who have different backgrounds who want to make computers. I thought we've made something good out of it,"" explained Dr Liam Kelly, chief executive of Oxford University Computing Technologies.At the heart of the computer is a chip designed to simulate the human brain, a brain made by a company called Arxiv, which has developed some of the basic algorithms used by scientists to make computers larger.But Kelly said it was something entirely different. He said the project was different from anything else he's worked on.So far the computer was designed for the UK, which has been very supportive of research - but is not an advanced country, he explained.""I don't think it's necessarily an obvious way to go about things,"" he said.This is a problem because some of the principles which have been taught have not always worked well.If you want to understand the whole brain then we need three different types of computer, a computer which can answer some questions which are more difficult, a computer for which you are going to have to solve problems which require you to understand, you need an AI system that gives answers to questions, it has to be able to predict how a human might perform some task.""As long as you have some problems there is a problem.""His team has already designed three machines.""The big question is how to go from simple questions we need to look at that are very difficult for some people the kind of computer that can predict how a human should perform those tasks...to some of these big questions, which are just very difficult because of the constraints of a particular brain.And then we also need to deal with some of the limitations of current computers.""Kelly said it would take around five years for the first version of the computer to be tested, and could go through tests at the Royal Institution at Oxford.""At first it will look like a normal computer and be a little bit slower but as you do more test we will see how it performs and then you can start having discussion with it that has wider applications.""In terms of the size of the machine, Kelly admits that even if computers that are only about the size of a pinhead can be made, there will still still be challenges.""If we get it right it will be smaller than the size of a pinhead. If somebody has one foot on the floor of a room, we can't even go near that.So just because it's a little bit bigger, it doesn't mean it can't be an enormously useful tool for a lot more people.""He said, as he is a graduate of Oxford, and is part of Oxford's Computing Systems group, he wasn't prepared to be in any doubt that Oxford students would be able to do things right.""At Oxford we have got a reputation for doing something right,"" he said. ""So I think it is a very encouraging sign for the future.""His team hopes to sell to businesses within the next year and hire around 100 people by the time of Christmas. He said that although the project involves a team of about two or three people, they believe that they will achieve what they are looking to achieve.""That kind of technology is important for the future of computing and not only in universities but also for businesses and industrial customers,"" he said.",1

"Some psychoanalysists have said psychoanalytic therapy (a form of treating feelings through suggestion) was introduced to ancient Greece on the order of Hesiod and Xenocrates. This is due both to the presence of certain Hippocratic themes (eg the emphasis on self-referring) which had an Aristotelian pedigree in antiquity, and also because of Homer's famous portrayal of Hermes Trismegistus as a teacher of wisdom (who would give someone an idea on how to cure himself with his own knowledge instead of using the advice of a teacher). Hippocrates himself is sometimes called as a disciple of Hippocrates, in honor of Hippocrates' teaching: ""the physician has also an old saying (phaedo hic est praesum), or a saying of ancient medicine. ""The saying should be that you do not know yourself if you do not ask what your physician wants you to know."" This is also often interpreted in the Greek text as an indictment of the psychoanalytic tradition – ""what must one ask of a teacher?"", and ""a physician only wants you to know what he wants you to know."" There is also a saying (phaedo est praesum), or an Aristotelian thought or opinion, which is attributed to the great physician Hippocrates, often translated in Latin as ""Hippocrates was a philosopher"". It is also believed that in ancient Greece there was a ""master of the mental sciences"". The idea of a master of the mind as having a special relationship with a particular subject is common to the Ancient Greeks. In the same way, the master of the mind itself, or a master of the human mind as the Greek word psychopsychos means ""one of the senses"". For example, this is why a patient can see a snake that resembles himself and a skilled hypnotist can hypnotize himself, he can perceive a dream and feel it as real...",1

"In the past months, several new publications have brought our understanding of the structure and function of the human gut to bear on this question. A key finding from the latter is that a high-protein diet reduces the risk of colon cancer, leading to the conclusion that a low-carbohydrate diet is even worse than our current one. In fact, we are witnessing the same phenomenon in non-diabetic individuals [35], who are often genetically predisposed to colon cancer [36]. There is evidence that certain components of the diet (e.g., fruit, vegetables) increase the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor 1, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor 17 as well as other chemokines and tumor suppressors [37]. For instance, dietary fructose is known to induce a number of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as a number of chemokines involved in cell surface adhesion [38]. Although there is no evidence to suggest that fasting glucose is somehow involved [39], fasting glucose appears to be an important regulator of inflammation by acting on adipocytes [40]. A recent study by Liu et al. [11] suggests that the gut microbiota can be considered to be an integrative mechanism and that it may in fact be more important than other components of the host body. This is perhaps related to the observations that the colon of insulin-resistant non-diabetic individuals was less diverse (the intestinal microbiota of obese and hypoglycemic individuals was similar), which may suggest that the microbiota plays a role in shaping body composition [41]. The beneficial effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on intestinal microbiota could be partly attributed to the beneficial effects on energy metabolism by removing excess carbohydrates from the gut. This means the use of carbohydrates can be reduced substantially [42]–[43] and this is likely to provide a therapeutic advantage for weight loss. This finding might be particularly useful for obesity as a potential treatment for colorectal adenomas [11]. A second important finding was recently related to the role of insulin resistance in the association of colorectal adenomas, but this may not be surprising as the intestinal microbiota of patients with type 2 diabetes, which contains an abundant amount of insulin receptors, was found to be impaired in these patients [44]. This may represent another way in which the presence of a low-carbohydrate diet in the diet might affect the composition of the microbiota: increased numbers of type 2 colonic bacteria may be responsible for less colonic bacteria, potentially allowing these bacteria to colonize more intestinal areas.",1

One thing for certain is that the meeting never had to end in this way. In fact, in his last day in office Obama made what was essentially a farewell to John Kerry, before giving a last eulogy in the White House.

The regime had for the past seven-months announced a fundamentalist ""Islamic reform"" program, either for their ""Allah, the Greatest"" project or having President Hamid Karzai elected, exclusively for their protection from possible defeat. Yet according to Afghan sources, 220-odd suspected al-Qaeda fighters attended the Valley of the Two Evils held by the resurgent Taliban.

"When asked to explain how this process would proceed, he pointed to a number of existing initiatives and suggested how to continue expanding and developing them. The mayor was asked to discuss a proposal that would increase the percentage of public space devoted to green infrastructure. He pointed out that many cities in the U.S. and much of Asia already have these types of infrastructure and in some places it has the power to improve their residents' well-being, while in others it undermines those residents' well-being. At least in this case the city could get the support needed from the residents to see these improvements approved, but this could also leave residents in harm's way, in an area already being overrun with traffic. While this may seem like a small matter in comparison to what could ultimately happen in places like Toronto and New Orleans, this seems to be a much larger issue. I am not sure whether this is the kind of planning effort we should support, the kind of solution we should be looking for and the kind of city we should be building, but we need to be making it more ambitious for cities to take on this kind of infrastructure if we are to ensure that sustainable cities are a reality. And these decisions can have ripple effects far beyond the city.

"After all, women are more inclined than men to agree with broader feminist narratives than to follow a specific one. Just look at how many youth within the most conservative circles figure out that this time the argument is far more intense, reasoned and – let's face it – strong: North America depends on us and decent women, and then abuse like this spills over into our country's terror network-opening cycle. Tom Friedman explains that these spectacular judicial injuries caused more desertions and suicides among its 1.7 million members than are legally sanctioned by the Justice Department: The anger comes off . . . in the courtroom, directly at men. Most people, however, can't grasp [this]. 'Women are oppressed everywhere,' they say. On national television, Ami Horowitz's Inside Activism tells the story of a military sex-slave ring that killed 180 servicemen, and Sen. Thomas Frank concludes that the 'five types of sexism' contribute to mass depression: work-based sexism, sex-based bias . . . our predilections for isolation and social isolation . . . ownership of racism . . . the ability to numb thoughts by fantasies – and yet women still contribute vis-à-vis 'masculinities': patriarchy. Many conservative women are sympathetic to Mohammed Ibn Azzam's teachings because their families and hospitality was at risk of Evelyn Waugh rhyming her father's crime against society, stretching his clipper reel into Piipuns news magazines used by college students—which would later be widely followed in the Star Tribune and Western print publications, as determined by every . . . l Sometime . . . there'll be pornography made the object of sexual frustration and vulnerability . . ."" The Guardian's entry on this reactionary women-focused defense language is called These Extremist Women Wonder Why So Many of They Just Call Them Lena Dunham's Targets, and contributes to the recurring paranoid about women being silenced by Hollywood that was introduced this year in respect of ""Star Wars."" However, in summary, complaints about toning down the intensity of gender resentments just comes with the territory for the feminist movement. Sexism has always been about self-preservation, the pursuit of sexual parity. Obviously misogyny has always been about power in the protection of women, and although there has been a commensurate reaction from the mainstream left, there was not a sign of a program to strip men out of politics to facilitate this ideal. Instead, numerous examples suggest the opposite: feminists want power and more power, and also more women who share feminist ideals of self-determination and accountability. There are some clockwork Chrystal and Kungrees, whom we see now—out of the laboring half of the profession who all got that memo in the last eight years. But these women represent only half the constituency, and basically",1

"This paper reviews empirical studies that examine the relationship between the use of social media, technology, and media use in the United States. The literature reviews the literature by using selected data from a variety of relevant research sources. This literature review is divided into a number of subgroups by the following main topic: (i) the use of social media by individuals, (ii) technological or social media factors, (iii) technology, (iv) media, and (v) cultural factors. The focus is on the impact of technology and media on use of social media and the cultural influences that can potentially increase use of social media. The literature reviewed include research on the relationship between the use of technology in everyday life and cultural values, research on factors that influence social media use and media use trends among teens, and study regarding media use. It was found that use of social media and technology were strongly positively correlated. While no clear link exists between use of social media and video games, the negative role of technology in youth is generally recognized. Media usage was strongly negatively correlated with using social media. The negative correlation was greatest for those using technology less than weekly and with use of technology by people working in technology. The literature reviewed includes studies that investigate the relationship between the impact of technology on youth, technology, and media. Additionally, it was found that technology and media use are related, as individuals who are engaging in technology may experience greater social interaction with other individuals, resulting in greater social interaction with others and with technology.",1
