South by Southwest (SXSW) is one of the most anticipated festivals in the world, showcasing the best in film, music, and interactive media. Every year, the festival’s selection committee handpicks a lineup of exciting new feature films from independent filmmakers worldwide. The much-anticipated event is set to begin on the 13th of March 2020 in Austin, Texas.
This year’s lineup includes the latest film from comedic actor, Pete Davidson. The King of Staten Island is a semi-autobiographical story about Davidson’s own experiences growing up in New York City’s Staten Island borough. The film explores how Davidson learned to cope with the tragic loss of his father, a NYC firefighter who died in the 9/11 attacks.
In the film, Davidson stars as Scott, a 24-year-old college dropout who is still living at home with his mother (played by Marisa Tomei) and a sister who is eager to move out. Scott is struggling to come to terms with his father’s untimely death and has been unable to move on from the tragedy. When his mother begins dating another firefighter, Scott’s world is turned upside down, and he must finally confront his feelings of grief and loss.
King of Staten Island is directed by Judd Apatow, known for his hit comedies such as Knocked Up, This is 40, and Trainwreck. Apatow brings his signature humor and heart to the film, making it a poignant yet hilarious exploration of grief, family, and relationships.
The film marks Davidson’s first leading role in a feature film, a significant step for the comedian who has become a beloved regular cast member on Saturday Night Live. Davidson’s raw and honest approach to comedy has made him a fan favorite, but the King of Staten Island showcases the actor’s range as he tackles dramatic material.
The news that King of Staten Island will open SXSW 2020 has been met with excitement from fans and critics alike. The festival has a reputation for discovering groundbreaking new films and launching the careers of up-and-coming talent. With Davidson’s star power and Apatow’s track record for success, many predict that the King of Staten Island will be one of this year’s festival highlights.
In addition to the film’s SXSW premiere, the King of Staten Island is set for a nationwide theatrical release on June 19, 2020. Fans will have the chance to see Davidson’s breakout film on the big screen, where they can experience the film’s hilarious and heartfelt moments in all their glory.
