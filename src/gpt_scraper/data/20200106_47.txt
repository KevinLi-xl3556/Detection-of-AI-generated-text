YouTube has been under fire in recent years for its handling of children’s privacy issues, with concerns raised about the platform’s data collection practices and the potential impact on young users. In response, the company has announced a series of new measures aimed at improving its children’s privacy practices. Here are four things you need to know about YouTube’s new children privacy practices.


Stricter age restrictions for YouTube videos: As part of its new measures, YouTube has increased the age restriction for videos that are targeted at children. Videos that are deemed to be “made for kids” will be restricted to viewers who are aged 12 years and under. This means that children will have limited access to videos that are not specifically designed for their age group.


Changes to data collection practices: YouTube has also made changes to its data collection practices in relation to children. The company will no longer allow personalised ads to be served on videos that are directed at children, and it will also limit the collection of personal data from users who are under the age of 13.


Stronger enforcement of content policies: YouTube has pledged to improve its enforcement of content policies, particularly in relation to videos that are directed at children. The company will be using machine learning to identify videos that are likely to be targeted at children, and it will also be implementing new guidelines for creators who upload child-directed content.


Increased transparency for content creators: As part of its new measures, YouTube is also making changes to its Creator Studio dashboard to provide creators with more information about the age groups that are watching their content. This will make it easier for creators to ensure that their content is compliant with the new children’s privacy practices.


In conclusion, YouTube’s new children privacy practices are an important step towards ensuring that the platform is a safe and appropriate environment for young users. The stricter age restrictions and changes to data collection practices will help to protect children’s privacy, while the increased enforcement of content policies and improved transparency for content creators will help to ensure that child-directed content is appropriate and compliant with regulations. Parents and guardians should familiarise themselves with these new practices and encourage their children to use the platform responsibly.
