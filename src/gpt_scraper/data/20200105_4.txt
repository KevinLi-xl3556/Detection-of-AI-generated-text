On December 26, 2019, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that Turkey would deploy its first troops to Libya to support the United Nations-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. The move has escalated Turkey’s involvement in the ongoing civil war in Libya, which has been ongoing since the fall of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
According to Erdogan, the goal of the deployment is to “ensure the stability and security of Tripoli and provide training to support the legitimate government in Libya.” The announcement came after Turkey and the GNA signed a security agreement in November 2019, which included provisions for military cooperation between the two countries.
The move has been met with criticism from several countries, including Egypt, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates, who support the Libyan National Army (LNA) and its leader, Khalifa Haftar. Haftar’s forces have been battling the GNA for control of Tripoli since April 2019, in a conflict that has left thousands dead and displaced over 200,000 people.
Turkey’s decision to intervene on behalf of the GNA is seen as a significant development in the conflict, as it could potentially tip the balance of power in favor of the GNA. The deployment of Turkish troops could also escalate tensions between Turkey and its regional rivals, such as Egypt and the UAE.
The announcement of the troop deployment comes after several months of increased Turkish involvement in Libya, which included the deployment of Turkish-made drones and military advisors to the country. Turkey has also been accused of supplying weapons to the GNA, in violation of a United Nations arms embargo on Libya.
The Turkish government has defended its actions, arguing that it is only providing support to the internationally recognized government in Libya, which it sees as under threat from Haftar’s forces. Erdogan has also argued that Turkey’s involvement in Libya is necessary to protect its interests in the region and prevent the spread of instability and terrorism.
However, some experts have warned that Turkey’s involvement in Libya could backfire, as it risks further inflaming regional tensions and drawing Turkey into a broader conflict. The conflict in Libya has already drawn in several regional players, including Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, all of whom are backing Haftar’s forces.
Despite these concerns, Erdogan has shown no signs of backing down from his support for the GNA in Libya. The deployment of Turkish troops marks a significant escalation of Turkey’s involvement in the conflict and raises the stakes of the ongoing civil war in Libya.
