Amtrakâ€™s Charge to Accommodate 2 Extra Wheelchairs? $25,000
In a country where accessibility and inclusivity are increasingly imperative, it is disappointing to learn that Amtrak has charged a group $25,000 for accommodations to transport two extra wheelchairs. This additional expense is nonsensical and highlights the lack of progress towards universal accessibility in public transportation.
In September 2019, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two other advocacy groups requested Amtrak to accommodate two extra wheelchairs on the Pacific Surfliner route in California. This route is a popular travel option for those looking to explore the scenic coastline, and with only two wheelchair spots available per train, those with mobility-related disabilities were being turned away.
While Amtrak initially agreed to make accommodations for the two extra wheelchairs, they levied an exuberant $25,000 fee for the requested addition. This arbitrary charge is reminiscent of the days when accessibility was viewed more as a costly inconvenience than a fundamental human right.
The NAD and its co-plaintiffs refused to back down, and they filed a lawsuit against Amtrak alleging a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA requires public transportation providers to provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, and the NAD argued that the $25,000 fee was equivalent to discrimination.
Following the lawsuit, the US Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the case, speaking out against the Amtrak fee. The statement noted that the transportation company had an obligation to provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, and the $25,000 fee may be considered unreasonable and discriminatory.
While Amtrak eventually rescinded the charge, it is still concerning that the initial cost even existed. It is imperative that accessibility is thought of as essential rather than optional, and it is the responsibility of both public and private entities to ensure that everyone can navigate the world around them freely.
This incident highlights the lack of progress towards universal accessibility in public transportation. It should serve as a reminder that accessibility should not be viewed as an extra cost, but as a necessary expense to ensure that everyone can participate fully in society.
In conclusion, the charge that Amtrak levied for two extra wheelchairs is a stark reminder that there is still a long way to go before our public transportation is fully inclusive. The $25,000 fee was not only arbitrary but could be considered discriminatory. We must work towards a future where accessibility and inclusivity are viewed as foundational values rather than optional extras.
