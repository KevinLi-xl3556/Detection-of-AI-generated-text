After ‘Please Like Me,’ Josh Thomas’s New Show Is All Fiction
Australian comedian Josh Thomas rose to fame in 2013 with his semi-autobiographical series ‘Please Like Me,’ which chronicled the life of a young man coming to terms with his sexuality and navigating the complexities of adulthood. The show was praised for its subtle humor, poignant storytelling, and honest portrayal of mental health issues.
Now, after a four-year hiatus, Thomas has returned with a brand new comedy series, ‘Everything’s Gonna Be Okay,’ which marks a departure from his earlier work. While ‘Please Like Me’ was largely inspired by Thomas’s own experiences, ‘Everything’s Gonna Be Okay’ is purely fictional.
The series follows Nicholas (played by Thomas), a neurotic twenty-something who finds himself thrust into the role of a caretaker for his two half-sisters when their father passes away. The show explores an array of themes, including grief, sexuality, and family dynamics, but unlike ‘Please Like Me,’ it’s not based on Thomas’s real life.
In an interview with NPR, Thomas explained that he wanted to challenge himself creatively by writing a show that wasn’t rooted in his personal experiences. “I’ve never done anything that’s not been about myself,” he said. “So this time I’m writing about something I don’t know anything about.”
The result is a sharp, witty, and often heartwarming show that’s been praised for its diverse cast, nuanced storytelling, and unique perspective. While ‘Everything’s Gonna Be Okay’ may not have the raw emotional intensity of ‘Please Like Me,’ it’s still a highly satisfying and engaging series that’s sure to resonate with audiences.
Of course, Thomas’s signature humor and sharp wit are still present in ‘Everything’s Gonna Be Okay,’ and fans of ‘Please Like Me’ will find plenty to enjoy. But by venturing into the realm of pure fiction, Thomas has proven that he’s not content to rest on his laurels, and is willing to challenge himself creatively in new and exciting ways.
‘Everything’s Gonna Be Okay’ is currently airing on Freeform in the United States, and has already been renewed for a second season. With its fresh perspective, strong writing, and engaging characters, it’s sure to continue winning over audiences and cementing Josh Thomas’s status as one of Australia’s most talented comedians.
