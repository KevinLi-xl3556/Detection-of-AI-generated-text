On Saturday, a brutal attack on a Yemen military base has resulted in an increasing death toll of at least 76 people. The attack, which took place in the central province of Marib, was carried out by Houthi rebels that have been fighting against the Yemeni government since 2014.
The deadly attack began with a ballistic missile that struck the military base, which was immediately followed by an assault by armed Houthi militants. The base was reportedly housing newly trained military recruits who were on their way to the front line to fight alongside the Yemeni government forces.
It is reported that at least 60 people were killed instantly in the attack, while 16 others succumbed to their injuries in nearby hospitals. The death toll is expected to rise further as many of the injured are in critical condition.
The Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was a response to the ongoing airstrikes launched by the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. The Marib province has been a focal point of the conflict between the Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government.
The United Nations has condemned the attack and called for an immediate cessation of violence in Yemen. The UN envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, criticized the attack and urged all parties to engage in dialogue to end the long-standing conflict.
The attack on the military base in Marib is just one of many violent incidents that have occurred in Yemen over the past few years. The conflict in Yemen has been ongoing since 2014, when the Houthi rebels overthrew the government and seized control of large parts of the country. Since then, the Yemeni government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, has been fighting to regain control of the country.
The war has devastated the country, leading to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Millions of Yemenis are on the brink of famine, and the country is also facing a cholera epidemic. The UN has described the situation in Yemen as the worldâ€™s worst humanitarian crisis.
The attack on the military base in Marib is another reminder of the urgency to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen. The international community must continue to support all efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict, which will provide Yemenis with the opportunity to live in peace and prosperity.
