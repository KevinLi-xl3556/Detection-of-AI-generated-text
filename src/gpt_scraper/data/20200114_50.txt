Everything’s Gonna Be Okay is a heartfelt and comedic TV series that debuted on Freeform in 2020. Created by Australian actor and writer, Josh Thomas, the show follows the life of Nicholas (played by Thomas), a young man who is in the process of figuring out his own life while caring for his two younger half-sisters.
The show manages to balance humor and heart in a way that feels fresh and genuinely heartfelt. The premise of the show is not new, but its execution is so well done that it elevates the material beyond what we might expect from a show about a young man caring for his younger siblings.
One of the greatest strengths of Everything’s Gonna Be Okay is its cast. The chemistry between the central trio of Thomas, Kayla Cromer (who plays the oldest of the half-sisters, Matilda, who is on the autism spectrum), and Maeve Press (who plays the youngest of the half-sisters, Genevieve) is palpable. They feel like a real family, with all the love, tension, and silliness that entails.
The show also doesn’t shy away from tough subjects, like grief, mental illness, and sexuality. But even in the most emotional scenes, Everything’s Gonna Be Okay never loses its sense of humor. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest times, there can still be moments of lightness and joy.
The show’s setting in Los Angeles also adds a unique flavor to the show. Nicholas, who is originally from Australia, is an outsider to American culture, and the show’s exploration of what it means to be an immigrant in the US is both humorous and thought-provoking.
While the first season of Everything’s Gonna Be Okay is only ten episodes long, it feels like a complete and satisfying story. The season finale is emotional and cathartic, but also leaves the door open for future episodes.
Overall, Everything’s Gonna Be Okay is a funny, heartfelt, and well-acted show that is well worth a watch. With its emphasis on family, love, and acceptance, it’s a show that feels especially poignant in these uncertain times.
