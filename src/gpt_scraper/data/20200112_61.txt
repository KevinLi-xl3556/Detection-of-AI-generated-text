For many people, sports fandom is more than just a hobby. It’s a way of life, a defining part of their identity. And for some, that fandom extends beyond just supporting the local team. Such was the case for a family from Brooklyn who were die-hard fans of the New York Yankees, despite living in the heart of Mets territory.
“We lived in Brooklyn, but we were New York Yankees fans,” recalls 63-year-old Peter Marino, who grew up in the borough during the 1960s and '70s. “My dad was a Yankees fan, his dad was a Yankees fan, and it just sort of trickled down to us kids.”
Marino’s family was far from alone in their allegiance to the Bronx Bombers. Despite being separated from Yankee Stadium by a long subway ride, many Brooklynites were drawn to the team’s winning ways and star-studded lineup. In the 1950s and '60s, the Yankees won a staggering 14 American League pennants and 10 World Series championships, cementing their place as the dominant team in baseball.
But being a Yankees fan in Brooklyn wasn’t always easy. The borough was home to its own baseball team, the Dodgers, who had a storied rivalry with the Yankees that dated back to the 1940s. When the Dodgers left Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1957, many local fans were left feeling bitter and betrayed. Some switched their allegiance to the new National League team that arrived in 1962, the New York Mets, while others simply gave up on baseball altogether.
For the Marinos, though, the departure of the Dodgers had little impact on their love of the Yankees. “We didn’t care about the Dodgers,” says Marino. “We were all about the Yankees. They were the kings of baseball, as far as we were concerned.”
The family’s fandom was solidified by trips to Yankee Stadium, which they made a few times each season despite the distance and expense. “It was always a big deal when we went to the stadium,” recalls Marino. “We’d take the subway up there, and we’d usually get there early so we could watch batting practice and try to get autographs.”
For Marino and his siblings, the highlight of those trips was seeing their heroes in action. “We loved players like Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Whitey Ford,” he says. “They were legends, and we got to watch them play in person. It was like a dream come true.”
Despite the distance from their favorite team, the Marinos never wavered in their devotion to the Yankees. They followed the team’s fortunes closely, listening to games on the radio and poring over box scores in the newspaper. When the Yankees won the World Series in 1977 and '78, it was cause for celebration in their household.
Today, the Marinos still root for the Yankees, though the family has since moved out of Brooklyn. They remain proud of their heritage as Brooklyn Yankees fans, however, and take pride in the fact that they supported a team that was so often at the top of its game.
“We were New York Yankees fans, first and foremost,” says Marino. “We didn’t care where we lived. As far as we were concerned, we were part of the Yankee family.” And for anyone who has ever felt a deep connection to a sports team, that sentiment is sure to ring true.
