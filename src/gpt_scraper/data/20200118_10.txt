The United States Navy has announced that a new aircraft carrier will be named after a brave Black Pearl Harbor veteran, Cook Third Class Doris Miller. Miller was an African American sailor who heroically fought in World War II and is perhaps best known for his actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
During the attack, Miller was stationed on the USS West Virginia, which was hit by torpedoes and bombs from Japanese aircraft. Despite not having been trained as a gunner, Miller leaped into action and manned a machine gun on the ship’s deck to return fire. Despite being exposed and vulnerable to enemy fire, Miller remained at the machine gun for several minutes, shooting down several enemy planes and inspiring the rest of the crew.
Miller’s bravery and heroism during the attack on Pearl Harbor inspired many people during a difficult time in American history. Despite facing discrimination and segregation at the time, Miller proved that Black soldiers were just as capable and courageous as anyone else.
The announcement of the new aircraft carrier, known as CVN-81, was made on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, emphasizing the Navy’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. The ship will be the fourth of the Gerald R. Ford-class carriers and is currently under construction in Newport News, Virginia.
The naming of the ship after Miller is a fitting tribute to the veteran and his legacy. Miller’s actions at Pearl Harbor symbolized the bravery and dedication of African Americans in serving their country during times of war. It is important to honor those who sacrificed so much for our freedom and to recognize the contributions of people of color in American history.
The Navy hopes that the naming of the ship after Miller will inspire future generations to learn about his heroic actions and the contributions of other Black soldiers during World War II. The ship will carry on the legacy of Doris Miller and serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by so many Americans during the war.
In conclusion, the announcement that a Navy aircraft carrier will be named after a Black Pearl Harbor veteran is a welcome tribute to an American hero. Doris Miller’s bravery and heroism during World War II continue to inspire people today, and naming the ship after him is a fitting way to recognize his contributions to American history. The ship’s construction is currently underway, and it will soon carry Miller’s legacy forward for generations to come.
