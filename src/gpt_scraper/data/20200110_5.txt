Impeachment, Iran, N.F.L. Playoffs: Your Friday Evening Briefing
Welcome to your Friday evening briefing. Here are the top stories you need to know as you head into the weekend.
Impeachment Trial Begins in Senate
The Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump began this week, with House impeachment managers presenting their case against Trump for incitement of insurrection. The managers played chilling footage of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, arguing that Trump’s rhetoric and actions before and during the attack were directly responsible for the violence that ensued. Trump’s defense team will present their case next week, with a final vote on whether to convict or acquit expected in the coming days.
Iran Blocks Nuclear Inspections
Iran announced this week that it would stop allowing United Nations inspectors access to its nuclear facilities, in what appears to be a retaliatory move against the U.S. and Europe for not lifting economic sanctions. The move is a blow to efforts to keep tabs on Iran’s nuclear program and could lead to a worsening of relations between Iran and the international community.
N.F.L. Playoffs Heat Up
The N.F.L. playoffs continue this weekend with two highly anticipated matchups. The Green Bay Packers will take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Championship game, while the Buffalo Bills will face off against the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game. Both games promise to be thrilling, with the winners advancing to Super Bowl LV.
