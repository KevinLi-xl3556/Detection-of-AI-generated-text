After months of intense negotiations, the trade deal between two economic giants has been signed - the United States and China. This deal between the two countries, which are the world’s two largest economies, affects not only the two nations involved, but also the global economy as a whole. While the trade deal appears to promise benefits for both nations, the devil may be in the details. Here are the winners and losers of the trade deal.
Winners:


American Farmers - One of the big wins for the United States was increased Chinese purchases of American agricultural products, which had been hit hard by the trade war. This move will provide a significant boost to American farmers who have been struggling with declining incomes and lost markets.


Technology Companies - The trade deal includes changes stipulating that China must strengthen intellectual property rights protection, and must also stop forcing US tech transfer deals. These changes are beneficial to US tech companies operating in China.


Car Manufacturers - The deal controls China’s car tariffs, which will restrict their effect on imported, American-made motor vehicles, and will also require American car producers to move some of their operations to China’s domestic market. This will provide a fantastic opportunity for American automobile exporters to sell their cars in the Chinese market.


Losers:


The Manufacturing Industry - The trade deal has been criticized for not doing enough to address China’s state-sponsored industries. The U.S. administration says it will keep tariffs on Chinese products until China reforms its economic policies. Due to these tariffs, US goods, including manufacturing products, will become more expensive in China, leading to lower sales for US manufacturers.


China’s Trading Partners - US tariffs on Chinese products led to company production to be shifted to other countries in Southeast Asia. But now that the trade deal has been signed, Chinese goods will become more competitive in the global market, causing a loss of competitiveness for other trading partners.


Intellectual Property Lawyers - Though the trade deal includes provisions requiring China to improve intellectual property, the need for lawyers will drop, and it could lead to reduced fees for them.


Overall, the trade deal can be considered a significant victory for both countries. Farmers, tech companies, and car manufacturers in the United States will likely benefit significantly from the deal, while manufacturing companies and China’s trading partners will potentially face some difficulties. The future will reveal how the provisions of the trade deal are actually implemented and the consequences that come with them.
