The Trump We Did Not Want to See
Donald Trump was an unexpected president. He won the 2016 US presidential election despite being a political outsider with no prior elected office experience. His victory was a shock to many who believed that his candidacy was a joke. However, after four tumultuous years, Trump’s presidency has come to an end, and many Americans are breathing a sigh of relief.
During his presidency, Trump was a polarizing figure who often wielded Twitter as a tool for both communicating with his base and inciting controversy. He was known for his fiery speeches, his constant use of the phrase “fake news,” and his sharp attacks on his opponents. He was also known for his policies, which ranged from rolling back environmental protections to making sweeping changes to the nation’s immigration system.
However, as Trump’s presidency began to unravel in 2020, many Americans began to see a side of Trump that they did not want to see. As the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the United States, Trump’s handling of the crisis was widely criticized. He downplayed the severity of the virus and pushed states to reopen their economies despite the warnings of public health experts. Trump’s refusal to take responsibility for the nation’s failures to control the virus became a defining theme of his presidency.
Trump’s handling of the pandemic was just one of the many examples of his presidency gone wrong. His rhetoric often turned into hateful speech, and he openly denigrated women, people of color, and other marginalized groups. His aggressive stance on immigration often led to the separation of children from their families at the border, a move that was widely condemned and led to protests all over the country.
Moreover, his presidency was marked by scandal after scandal, from his alleged ties to Russia to his impeachment in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Throughout it all, Trump continued to tweet, often contradicting his own administration’s policies and statements.
Perhaps the most worrying aspect of Trump’s presidency was the way he tried to undermine democratic institutions. He consistently attacked the media, the judiciary, and even the intelligence community for not being loyal to him. In the run-up to the 2020 election, he repeatedly made baseless claims of voter fraud, which culminated in the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol. That event, which saw Trump supporters storm the Capitol and disrupt the certification of the 2020 election results, showed just how deep Trump’s influence went.
In the end, Trump’s presidency was a mixed bag. He will be remembered for his bombastic rhetoric, his divisive policies, and his constant attacks on the media, but he will also be remembered for his failures. His handling of the pandemic, his destructive stance on immigration, and his attempts to undermine democratic institutions will be remembered as some of the most significant failures of his presidency. His legacy will be debated for years to come, but one thing is clear: the Trump we did not want to see was the one who emerged during his presidency, a paradoxical figure who was both unpredictable and deeply unpopular.
