Known as the “Queen of Retail,” she was a fixture in the industry for over three decades, and her career was marked by a number of high-profile deals and a reputation for tireless work and unmatched expertise.
But beyond her professional success, Consolo’s life was marked by a number of personal struggles and challenges, and her legacy is one that is both inspiring and complex.
Born in Brooklyn in 1945, Consolo grew up in a working-class family and was the youngest of three children. From an early age, she was determined to make a name for herself, and after studying business and marketing in college, she set her sights on a career in retail.
Her first job was at Bloomingdale’s, where she worked as a buyer and quickly made a name for herself. In 1973, she was recruited by Garrick-Aug Associates, a small real estate firm that specialized in retail leasing. It was there that she found her true calling, and she spent the next three decades building a reputation as one of the city’s most successful and respected real estate brokers.
Over the course of her career, Consolo worked on some of the city’s most high-profile deals, including the leasing of the Plaza Hotel retail space, the Time Warner Center, and the World Trade Center. She was known for her sharp negotiating skills, her ability to spot trends before anyone else, and her tireless work ethic.
But despite her professional success, Consolo’s personal life was marked by a number of challenges. She struggled with infertility and underwent numerous rounds of IVF before finally adopting a daughter, Melissa, in 1995. She also faced criticism and discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated industry, and battled health issues throughout her life.
In 2018, Consolo passed away at the age of 73, leaving behind a legacy that was both impressive and complicated. She was remembered by colleagues and friends as a trailblazer, a mentor, and a fierce advocate for women in the industry. But her life was also marked by personal struggles and challenges, and her legacy is a reminder of the complex and multifaceted nature of success.
Despite the challenges she faced, however, Consolo never lost her drive or her passion for the industry she loved. She was a true pioneer and a role model for generations of women who have followed in her footsteps, and her contributions to the world of real estate will be remembered for years to come.
In the end, the real story of Faith Hope Consolo is one of perseverance, determination, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. She was a woman who refused to be defined by the challenges she faced, and who never lost sight of her dreams or her goals. And for that, she will always be remembered as a true icon of the industry.
