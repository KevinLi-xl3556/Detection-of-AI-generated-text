The year 2020 will undoubtedly go down in history as a pivotal moment in time. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the world in countless ways, forcing people of all ages to adapt to new realities. For students, the experience has been particularly unique, as they’ve had to navigate remote learning, social distancing, and a world that suddenly became more uncertain.
Growing up in another era has also been a topic of discussion among students, many of whom have parents or grandparents who lived through significant historical events like the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, or the Cold War. These experiences have given students a broader perspective on the world and helped shape their understanding of current events.
Finally, distraction has been a significant concern for students in recent years, as smartphones, social media, and other digital technologies have made it easier than ever to lose focus. With the pandemic forcing more students to learn from home, the problem has only become more pronounced.
So what are students saying about all of these topics? We spoke to a few to find out.
Remote Learning and the Challenges of 2020
For many students, the sudden shift to remote learning in early 2020 was a challenging experience. “I wasn’t prepared for how much harder it would be to stay motivated when I wasn’t in a classroom,” says Sarah, a college student. “It’s just harder to focus when you’re sitting in your bedroom with your laptop.”
Other students echoed this sentiment, with some saying that they missed the social interaction and sense of structure that comes with being in a physical classroom. However, many students also recognized that the pandemic was a unique event that required unique solutions. “I think my school did the best they could under the circumstances,” says Jackson, a high school senior. “It wasn’t perfect, but we all did our best to adapt.”
Growing Up in Another Era
For some students, growing up with parents or grandparents who lived through significant historical events has been an eye-opening experience. “My grandpa was a soldier in World War II, and hearing his stories made me appreciate everything he and his generation did to fight for our country,” says Emily, a high school junior.
Others have had similar experiences learning about the civil rights movement, the feminist movement, or other social justice movements. “My mom was involved in the fight for marriage equality, and hearing her stories made me realize how far we’ve come as a society,” says Liam, a college sophomore.
Overall, students seem to appreciate the perspective that comes with hearing firsthand accounts of historical events. Many say it has made them more aware of their place in the world and inspired them to be more active in shaping their own future.
Distraction and Digital Technologies
Finally, distraction is a topic that many students have strong opinions about. Some say that they struggle to stay focused on their schoolwork because of the constant notifications and distractions from their smartphones and other digital devices. “It’s hard to resist the urge to check Instagram or Snapchat when my phone is right there,” says Madison, a high school sophomore.
Others say that technology has actually helped them stay organized and on task. “I use apps like Trello and Google Calendar to keep track of my assignments and deadlines, and it really helps me stay focused,” says Alex, a college junior.
Ultimately, it seems that distraction is a problem that students will continue to face in the years ahead. However, with new technologies and tools emerging all the time, there may also be new solutions on the horizon.
In Conclusion
The year 2020 has been a challenging one for students, but it has also been a time of growth and reflection. Students are grappling with new realities, learning from the experiences of past generations, and trying to find ways to stay focused and engaged in a world full of distractions. As we move
