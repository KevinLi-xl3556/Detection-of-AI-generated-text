Margaret McFarland was a key figure in the life of Fred Rogers, better known as Mister Rogers. While many people are familiar with Rogers’ legacy as a beloved children’s television host, fewer are aware of the important role that McFarland played in his life and work. As a developmental psychologist and educator, McFarland was instrumental in shaping Rogers’ approach to communicating with young viewers. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at McFarland’s life and work, and explore the ways in which she helped to shape Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood into the iconic program it became.
Margaret McFarland was born in 1904 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She earned her undergraduate degree from Vassar College in 1926, and went on to complete her graduate studies in psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. After completing her doctorate, McFarland worked as a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Education. She also served as the director of the Arsenal Family and Children’s Center, a pioneering community organization that provided resources and support to families in Pittsburgh.
It was through her work at the Arsenal Center that McFarland first crossed paths with Fred Rogers. Rogers was working as a puppeteer at the time, and had been hired to perform at the center’s annual fundraiser. McFarland was immediately struck by Rogers’ gentle demeanor and his ability to connect with children through his puppetry. She invited him to join the center’s staff, and the two soon became close friends and collaborators.
Over the years, McFarland’s influence on Rogers would be profound. As a developmental psychologist, McFarland understood the importance of connecting with children on their level. She encouraged Rogers to communicate with his young viewers in a way that was honest, respectful, and empathetic. She also helped him to develop his signature approach of speaking directly to the camera, as if he were having a conversation with a single child.
McFarland’s influence can be seen in the many ways that Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood was designed to be developmentally appropriate for young viewers. The program’s pacing was slow and deliberate, with plenty of time for children to absorb and process information. The use of puppets and other imaginative elements was carefully calibrated to engage children’s imaginations without overwhelming them. And the show’s focus on emotional intelligence and social skills helped to create a safe and supportive environment for young viewers.
Despite her enormous contributions to Rogers’ work, McFarland remained largely unknown to the wider public. She passed away in 1988, and it wasn’t until years later that her pivotal role in the creation of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood began to be recognized. In 2018, McFarland was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Fred Rogers Center for her contributions to the field of children’s media.
Today, McFarland’s legacy lives on in the many children who continue to be inspired by Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Her work reminds us of the importance of connecting with children on their level, and of the profound impact that a kind and compassionate mentor can have on a young person’s life. As Mister Rogers himself once said, “It’s you I like, it’s not the things you wear, it’s not the way you do your hair, but it’s you I like.” Margaret McFarland embodied this sentiment in her work with Fred Rogers, and her influence continues to resonate with viewers of all ages.
