Mission Impawsible: How Much ‘Cats’ Can a Person Take?
The movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘Cats’ was one of the most anticipated movies of 2019. The musical had been a hit on Broadway for years, and the movie version promised to bring a new dimension to the beloved classic. However, upon its release, ‘Cats’ received mixed reviews, with some calling it a cinematic disaster, while others enjoyed it for its dazzling visuals and catchy soundtrack.
Despite the mixed reviews, ‘Cats’ has become somewhat of a notorious movie, with many wondering just how much of it they can actually sit through. The answer to that question is entirely subjective and depends on the individual’s tolerance for a few particular elements that make ‘Cats’ unique.
Firstly, it’s essential to understand that ‘Cats’ is a musical that relies heavily on song and dance. If you’re someone who enjoys musical theatre and can appreciate the artistry of performers belting out show tunes while moving their bodies in a feline manner, then ‘Cats’ may be right up your alley.
On the other hand, if you’re not a fan of musical theatre or find the idea of humans dressed in cat costumes singing and dancing to be too strange, then sitting through the entirety of ‘Cats’ may prove to be difficult.
Another factor to consider is the movie’s CGI. The filmmakers used motion capture technology to turn live-action performers into photorealistic cats. The result is a visually stunning movie that features some truly impressive animation. However, for some viewers, the sight of human faces pasted onto cat bodies may be off-putting, leading to discomfort or even a feeling of creepiness.
One of the most polarizing aspects of ‘Cats’ is the film’s story, or lack thereof. The movie follows a group of cats called the Jellicles as they prepare for the Jellicle Ball, an annual event where one cat is chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and be reborn. To some, this plot may seem bizarre and nonsensical, while others may appreciate the story as a surreal journey through a fantastical world.
Ultimately, the answer to the question of how much ‘Cats’ a person can take is entirely subjective. For some viewers, sitting through the entire movie may be an enjoyable and entertaining experience, while for others, a couple of musical numbers may be all they can handle.
It’s worth noting that ‘Cats’ has gained somewhat of a cult following, with some viewers becoming obsessed with its bizarre aesthetic and quirky storytelling. In that sense, the movie may be enjoyable for some viewers as a guilty pleasure or something to watch ironically.
In conclusion, ‘Cats’ is a film that has divided audiences and generated a significant amount of conversation since its release. Whether or not a person can sit through the entire movie comes down to personal taste and tolerance for the movie’s specific elements. So if you’re curious about ‘Cats,’ there’s only one way to find out how much of it you can handle: take the plunge and give it a watch. Who knows? You may just find yourself becoming a die-hard Jellicle fan.
