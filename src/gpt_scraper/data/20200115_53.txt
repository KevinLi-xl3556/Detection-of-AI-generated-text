First off, there’s “Nomadland,” directed by Chloe Zhao, which tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey through the American West after losing everything in the Great Recession. The film has already won the top prize at the Venice, Toronto, and Golden Globe festivals, making it a top contender for Best Picture.
Then there’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” directed by Aaron Sorkin, which follows the infamous trial of a group of activists charged with conspiracy during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. With an all-star cast including Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, and Mark Rylance, this historical drama has earned rave reviews from both audiences and critics alike.
Another potential winner is “Minari,” directed by Lee Isaac Chung, which tells the story of a Korean-American family who moves to Arkansas in the 1980s in search of a better life. The film explores themes of family, identity, and the American Dream, and has already won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival.
Next up is “Judas and the Black Messiah,” directed by Shaka King, which is based on the true story of Fred Hampton, the charismatic leader of the Black Panther Party in the late 1960s. The film stars Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield in a powerful and poignant exploration of race, politics, and freedom.
Last but not least is “Promising Young Woman,” directed by Emerald Fennell, which tells the story of a woman seeking revenge for a tragic event in her past. With a biting script and a bold visual style, the film has already won the Best Original Screenplay award at the Critics’ Choice Awards.
