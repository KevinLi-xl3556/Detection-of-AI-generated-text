As the world watched, Australia suffered what many called the worst natural disaster that the country has ever seen- the bushfire crisis that affected millions of hectares, destroyed entire communities and killed millions of wild animals. In light of this, many have come together to raise awareness of the disaster, and one of the best ways to do this is by reading. This article seeks to highlight some of the resources available for those interested in learning more about the bushfire crisis and its impact on Australia.
One of the best places to start is the book “The Arsonist: A Mind on Fire” by Chloe Hooper. Written by an Australian novelist, the book manages to provide insightful commentary into the bushfires of 2019 and the individuals who set them on fire. The author does a fantastic job not only documenting the events but also exploring the dark psychology of the culprit during the crisis.
Another fantastic read is “On Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal” by Naomi Klein, which investigates the underlying causes of ecological disasters, including how climate change played a role in the Australian bushfire crisis. The author uses her extensive experience in the field of climate science to explore how society can combat climate change by implementing the Green New Deal.
If you’re looking to read something more academic in nature, the book “Fire on Earth: An Introduction” by Stephen J. Pyne is an excellent choice. This book is an extensive study of global fire ecology and its impact on ecosystems. Pyne, a fire historian, paints a vivid picture of how fire has always been a natural part of the Australian ecosystem, but the recent bushfire crisis has greatly disrupted the balance.
For those who prefer to read online, “The Guardian” released a comprehensive series of articles documenting the bushfires’ impact in Australia. Articles such as “From Raging Fires to Charity Donations: the Great Australian Bushfire Response” and “The Australian Bushfire in Photos” provide a well-rounded view of the crisis from start to finish.
In conclusion, the bushfire crisis in Australia was a harrowing event that affected the entire world, and it’s important to gain insight and learn from such events. The above-mentioned resources can provide valuable insights into the bushfire crisis and help readers understand the impact better. Through reading, we can not only educate ourselves, but we can keep the conversation going and continue to push for change, in Australia and beyond.
