As tensions escalate between the United States and Iran, the phrase “America First” has taken on an increasingly militaristic tone on Fox News. The conservative news network, which has long been a supporter of President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies, has shifted its rhetoric to support the president’s decision to order the drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, one of Iran’s top military commanders.
However, this shift has not been without controversy. While many Fox News hosts have rallied behind Trump’s decision, others have been more cautious, urging the president to tread carefully in a volatile region that has long been a flashpoint for conflict.
One of the most vocal supporters of Trump’s Iran strike has been Laura Ingraham, who has used her primetime show, “The Ingraham Angle,” to defend the president’s decision and attack critics who argue that the strike could lead to war with Iran. Ingraham has praised Trump’s leadership and accused Democrats of being weak on national security.
However, not all Fox News hosts are on board with Ingraham’s hardline stance. Chris Wallace, host of “Fox News Sunday,” has criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the Iran crisis, arguing that the president’s impulsive decision-making has destabilized the region and put American lives at risk.
Similarly, Neil Cavuto, host of “Your World,” has expressed concern about the lack of a clear strategy for Iran and warned that the United States could be drawn into a wider conflict if the situation escalates further. Cavuto has called for cooler heads to prevail and for the administration to engage in diplomacy rather than making unilateral military decisions.
Despite these dissenting voices, Fox News remains a powerful megaphone for the Trump administration, and its “America First” message is resonating with many Americans who are tired of what they see as endless wars and foreign entanglements. As the 2020 presidential election draws near, it remains to be seen whether this message will continue to resonate, or whether voters will demand a more nuanced approach to foreign policy.
