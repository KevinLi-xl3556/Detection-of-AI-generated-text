According to a recent study, women are increasingly taking the reins as directors of major films. The research, which was conducted by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, found that women directed 29% of the top 100 grossing films in 2020. This is the highest percentage in the study’s history.
The study analyzed the top-grossing films in the United States and Canada, which included films from major studios such as Disney, Warner Bros, and Universal. The research revealed that women directors were more likely to work on independent films or films with smaller budgets. However, in 2020, several high-profile films directed by women made significant box office earnings, including Chloe Zhao’s “Nomadland” and Regina King’s “One Night in Miami.”
Despite the increase in female directors, the study also revealed that women continued to face barriers in the film industry. Women-directed films tended to have smaller budgets compared to male-directed films, and women were less likely to direct action or science fiction movies, which are typically associated with higher budgets and box office earnings.
The study’s authors also noted that women directors of color remained underrepresented in the film industry. Female directors of color only accounted for 9% of the top 100 grossing films in 2020, despite making up 22% of the US population.
The increasing number of women directing major films is a positive step towards gender equality in the film industry. However, the study highlights the need for increased diversity and equal opportunities for all women, particularly women of color. It is essential for the film industry to continue to support and promote women directors, both financially and creatively, to ensure equal representation and to tell diverse stories onscreen.
In conclusion, the past year has seen a significant increase in the number of women directing major films, with the highest percentage in the study’s history. However, it is essential to continue to push for gender equality and diversity in the film industry to ensure equal opportunities and representation for all.
