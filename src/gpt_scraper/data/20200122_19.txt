Modern Love Podcast: Jessalyn Gilsig Reads ‘My Secret Left Me Unable to Help’
In the latest episode of the Modern Love podcast, actress Jessalyn Gilsig reads an essay titled “My Secret Left Me Unable to Help”. The essay, written by an anonymous author, tells the story of a woman who struggles to overcome the shame and guilt surrounding a secret she has kept from her husband.
The author begins by describing how, in the early days of their marriage, she and her husband would talk about everything. They would stay up late into the night, sharing their hopes, dreams, and secrets. But as time went on, the author began to keep a secret from her husband – a secret that she was afraid would destroy their relationship.
The author’s secret was this: she had been sexually abused as a child. The trauma of the experience was something that she had never fully dealt with, and it continued to haunt her even as an adult. She had told no one about what had happened to her, not even her husband.
As the years went on, the author found that her secret was taking a toll on her mental health. She struggled with depression and anxiety, and she felt like she was living a lie. She longed to tell her husband the truth, but she was afraid of how he would react.
Finally, after more than a decade of marriage, the author found the courage to tell her husband about the sexual abuse she had endured as a child. To her surprise, he was supportive and understanding. He listened to her story without judgment, and he helped her find the help and resources she needed to heal.
In the end, the author writes that she feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders. She no longer feels like she is living a lie, and she is grateful for the love and support of her husband.
The essay is a powerful reminder of the importance of being open and honest in our relationships. Keeping secrets can be incredibly isolating, and the shame and guilt that often accompany them can be debilitating. But when we find the courage to share our truths with those we love, we open the door to deeper connection and healing.
Jessalyn Gilsig’s narration of the essay is both poignant and heartfelt, and her performance captures the emotional weight of the author’s story. Listeners are sure to be moved by her powerful portrayal of this deeply personal essay.
Overall, the latest episode of the Modern Love podcast is a must-listen for anyone who has ever struggled with a secret they felt unable to share. It serves as a reminder that, no matter how difficult our stories may be, there is always hope for healing and reconciliation.
