Wanted: A Home for Three Million Records
In the digital age, music streaming services have become the norm, allowing us to access an endless library of songs with just a few taps on our screens. But for vinyl enthusiasts, there’s nothing quite like the tactile experience of flipping through stacks of records, carefully selecting the next album to spin, and gently placing the needle on the groove to immerse oneself in the rich, warm sound of vinyl. For one dedicated collector, a love for vinyl records has turned into a passion that has resulted in a staggering collection of three million records. Now, this collector is on a quest to find a new home for their cherished collection.
Meet Mark Thompson, a 57-year-old music aficionado from Portland, Oregon, who has spent decades amassing an impressive assortment of vinyl records. Thompson’s love affair with records started at a young age when he inherited a small collection from his father. Over the years, he has scoured record stores, estate sales, and thrift shops, as well as traded records with fellow collectors, to build his massive collection. Thompson’s records span various genres, including rock, jazz, blues, classical, hip hop, country, and more, covering a vast musical landscape.
Thompson’s collection has grown to such an extent that it has taken over every available space in his modest two-bedroom apartment. Records are meticulously organized in shelves, crates, and boxes, filling up the living room, dining room, and even the bathroom. Thompson’s passion for vinyl records goes beyond just collecting; he spends hours listening to and curating his collection, appreciating the artwork, and delving into the history of the music and artists.
However, Thompson’s living situation has recently changed, and he is now faced with a predicament - he needs to find a new home for his cherished collection. His apartment is bursting at the seams, and he simply does not have the space to accommodate his ever-growing collection anymore. Thompson has tried to downsize his collection, but parting with his beloved records is a heart-wrenching task.
“I’ve put so much time, effort, and love into building this collection. Each record holds a special place in my heart, and it’s not easy to part with them,” Thompson said, as he gently flipped through the sleeves of his prized albums.
Thompson’s search for a new home for his three million records has proven to be a challenging task. He has approached local libraries, museums, and record stores, but finding a space that can house such a massive collection has proven to be difficult. Thompson is not looking to sell his collection; rather, he hopes to find a place where his records can be preserved, appreciated, and enjoyed by others.
“I want to find a home where my records can be accessible to music lovers and researchers alike. I’ve put so much effort into curating this collection, and I want it to be a resource for future generations to appreciate and learn from,” Thompson explained.
Thompson’s quest has garnered attention from fellow vinyl enthusiasts and music lovers, who are amazed by the sheer size and diversity of his collection. Many have voiced their support for Thompson’s mission to find a new home for his records and preserve this unique piece of music history.
“Mark’s collection is truly remarkable, and it would be a shame if it were not properly preserved and made accessible to others. His passion for vinyl records is infectious, and I hope he can find a suitable home for his collection,” said Susan Johnson, a fellow vinyl collector and a longtime friend of Thompson.
Thompson remains hopeful that he will find a new home for his beloved records. He dreams of a place where his collection can be properly stored, catalogued, and made available to music enthusiasts and researchers. He hopes that his collection can continue to
