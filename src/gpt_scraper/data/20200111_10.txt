In the world of football, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or C.T.E., has become a much-discussed topic in recent years. As the understanding of this degenerative brain disease grows, so too does the fear that it may be contributing to the premature deaths of many current and former players. For one family, the reality of C.T.E. and its potential impact on the lives of those in the football community has hit home in a profound and devastating way.
The family of Tyshon Dye, a former football player for Clemson University, has been grappling with the loss of their son and brother since his tragic death in 2019. Dye was just 25 years old when he drowned while swimming in Lake Hartwell in South Carolina. His death was a shock to those who knew him and loved him, but it also left his family with unanswered questions about what may have led to his untimely passing.
As it turns out, Dye had been experiencing symptoms of C.T.E. prior to his death. His mother, Tisha, says that he had been forgetful and prone to mood swings, and had even suffered a seizure earlier that year. While his family had not yet confirmed a diagnosis of C.T.E., they believe that the disease may have played a role in his death, given what they know about the impact it can have on the brain.
C.T.E. is a condition that is caused by repetitive head trauma, such as the kind that is sustained in football. The disease is characterized by a buildup of tau protein in the brain, which can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, depression, and aggression. Over time, C.T.E. can cause significant damage to the brain, and it has been linked to a higher risk of suicide and other psychiatric disorders.
While C.T.E. is still not fully understood, researchers and medical professionals are working hard to learn more about the disease and its potential impact on those in the football community. Efforts are being made to better diagnose and treat the condition, as well as to increase awareness among players and their families about the risks that come with playing football.
For Dye’s family, the pain of his loss is still very real, and the specter of C.T.E. looms large in their minds. They hope that by sharing their story, they can raise awareness about the disease and the need for more research and support for those impacted by it.
“We don’t want anyone else to have to go through what we are going through,” says Tisha Dye. “We want to see more done to help the young men and women who are out there playing the game that Tyshon loved so much, and to make sure that they are protected and cared for.”
As the football community continues to grapple with the realities of C.T.E. and its impact on the lives of players and their families, it is clear that much work still needs to be done. But with greater awareness and support, there is hope that we can find ways to minimize the risks associated with the sport, and to ensure that those who love it can continue to play it safely for years to come.
