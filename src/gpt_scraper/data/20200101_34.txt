As the United States and North Korea continue their on-again, off-again negotiations over nuclear disarmament, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the reclusive nation isn’t done trolling President Trump. Despite the historic Singapore summit in 2018 and a follow-up meeting in Vietnam the following year, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, seems to be playing a long game that involves dragging out negotiations, making vague promises, and occasionally lobbing insults at the U.S. president.
There are a few reasons why North Korea might be taking this approach. For one thing, the country’s leaders have long seen nuclear weapons as a key tool for their survival, and they’re not likely to give them up easily. Furthermore, the regime has a long history of brinksmanship and saber-rattling, and they may see the current negotiations as just another way to gain leverage and attention on the world stage.
But perhaps the most compelling reason why North Korea is still trolling Trump is simply because it’s effective. The U.S. president has a well-documented tendency to respond to insults and provocations with bluster and threats of his own, and Kim Jong-un seems to be exploiting that weakness to his advantage.
For example, in 2017, when Trump referred to Kim as “Rocket Man” in a speech to the United Nations, North Korea responded by calling him a “mentally deranged dotard.” Trump, predictably, fired back on Twitter, calling Kim “short and fat” and threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea. The back-and-forth made headlines around the world, but it didn’t do much to bring the two countries closer to a peaceful resolution.
More recently, North Korea has been using its state-run media to criticize Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, calling him a “selfish and narrow-minded” leader who is “only interested in his own political interests.” This is likely an attempt to distract from the country’s own struggles with the virus and shift the blame to the U.S.
So, what can be done about North Korea’s trolling? Some experts argue that the U.S. should simply ignore the regime’s provocations and focus on long-term diplomacy and engagement. Others argue that the U.S. needs to take a more aggressive stance, perhaps by imposing tougher sanctions or even launching a preemptive strike against North Korea’s nuclear facilities.
Ultimately, the best approach probably lies somewhere in between. The U.S. should continue to engage with North Korea diplomatically, but it should also be clear about its expectations and red lines. It should also be prepared to respond forcefully to any provocative actions, while avoiding the kind of bluster and brinksmanship that has characterized the Trump administration’s approach so far.
One thing is clear, however: North Korea’s trolling is not going away anytime soon. As long as the regime sees it as an effective way to gain attention and leverage, it will continue to use it. The challenge for the U.S. is to find a way to deal with this behavior without getting drawn into a cycle of escalation and confrontation that could be disastrous for both countries and the world as a whole.
