In today’s society, students are becoming increasingly vocal about the issues that they care about. From changing the school lunch menu to discussing controversial topics such as “Megxit” and emoji use, students are making their voices heard.
One of the most common concerns that students have is the quality of their school lunch. Many students feel that the current options are not healthy, appetizing, or filling enough. In response to this, there have been various student-led initiatives to improve school lunch menus. One such initiative is the “Farm to School” program, which promotes the use of local and fresh ingredients in school meals. Another approach is the “Meatless Monday” campaign, which encourages schools to serve vegetarian meals once a week.
But changing the school lunch menu is not the only issue on students’ minds. Another topic that has been making waves is “Megxit” - the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to step back from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family. While opinions vary on this issue, many students appreciate the couple’s desire for privacy and independence.
On a lighter note, students are also having fun with emojis. Emojis are a popular way to express emotions and ideas, but some students are taking it to the next level. For example, there are now “emoji scavenger hunts” where participants have to find and take pictures of real-life objects that match a particular emoji. It’s a creative way to use technology and get outside at the same time.
Overall, it’s clear that students are not afraid to share their thoughts and opinions on a wide range of topics. From school lunch to international news to playful use of emojis, students are using their voices to create change and have fun in the process. It’s an exciting time to be a student, and we can’t wait to see what they’ll do next.
