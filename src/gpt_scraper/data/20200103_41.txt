The assassination of Iranian General Qasem Suleimani by the United States in January 2020 sent shockwaves across the world, with many nations condemning the act as an act of aggression and a violation of international law. However, one country that has lauded the assassination, albeit with caution, is Israel.
Israel has been engaged in a long-standing conflict with Iran, with tensions rising significantly in recent years as Iran has increased its support for proxy groups in the region, including Hamas and Hezbollah. General Suleimani was a key figure in Iran’s military and intelligence apparatus and was responsible for overseeing many of Iran’s military operations in the region. Israel viewed him as a significant threat, and his assassination was seen as a major victory.
In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, Israeli leaders were quick to praise the US for taking action against Suleimani. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the assassination a “justified act of self-defense,” while Defense Minister Naftali Bennett praised it as a “bold move” that would help deter Iran from further aggression.
However, Israel’s praise of the assassination was tempered by concerns about the potential fallout. Israel feared that Iran would retaliate against it directly, and also that Iran’s proxies in the region, particularly Hezbollah, would increase their attacks against Israel. In response to these concerns, Israel took steps to increase its military readiness and bolster its defenses along the northern border with Lebanon.
Furthermore, while Israel welcomed the removal of Suleimani, it also recognized that his death would not necessarily lead to a de-escalation of tensions in the region. Iran remains a significant threat to Israel’s security, and its continued support for proxy groups in the region means that the threat of attack remains high.
In the months following the assassination, Israel has continued to monitor the situation closely, with senior officials stressing the need for caution and restraint. While Israel sees the assassination as a significant blow to Iran’s military capabilities, it also recognizes that it could lead to a dangerous escalation of hostilities.
Overall, Israel’s response to the assassination of General Suleimani reflects the complex and fraught nature of its relationship with Iran. While Israel welcomes any action that weakens Iran’s military capabilities, it also recognizes that the fallout from such actions can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. As the situation in the region continues to evolve, Israel will need to continue to balance its desire for security with the need for caution and restraint.
