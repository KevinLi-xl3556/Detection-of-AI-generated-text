Shin Kyuk-ho, the founder of Lotte Group and often referred to as the “Chewing Gum Tycoon,” passed away on January 19, 2020, at the age of 98. The news of his passing marked the end of one of the most influential business figures in the modern history of South Korea.
Shin Kyuk-ho was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1921. As a young man, he worked as a salesman for a chewing gum company and quickly rose up the ranks. He eventually founded Lotte Group in Japan in 1948, starting out as a chewing gum manufacturer.
Under Shin’s leadership, Lotte Group expanded rapidly in South Korea and other parts of the world. The company diversified into a wide range of industries, including retail, food and beverage, petrochemicals, and construction. Today, Lotte Group is one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea, with over 80 subsidiaries and over 100,000 employees worldwide.
Shin Kyuk-ho was known for his innovative business strategies and his ability to pivot the company in response to changing market conditions. He was also a philanthropist, dedicating much of his wealth to supporting education, healthcare, and cultural initiatives in South Korea and other parts of the world.
Despite his success, Shin Kyuk-ho’s legacy was not without controversy. In 2014, he was sentenced to four years in prison for embezzlement and breach of trust. The case centered around allegations that he had used company funds to cover personal expenses, including his wife’s medical bills and his daughter’s wedding expenses.
Nevertheless, Shin Kyuk-ho will be remembered as one of South Korea’s most influential business leaders. His legacy lives on through Lotte Group, a company that continues to shape the economy of South Korea and beyond.
As news of his passing spread, many people took to social media to express their condolences and pay tribute to Shin Kyuk-ho’s life and career. “May he rest in peace,” one Twitter user wrote. “He was a true pioneer and a role model for many of us in the business world.”
