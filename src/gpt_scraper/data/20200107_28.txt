On January 3, 2020, President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, which quickly became a topic of debate in the media. While some in the conservative media praised Trump’s decision, others expressed skepticism and even dissent. One prominent voice in the latter camp was Tucker Carlson, a host on Fox News.
Carlson’s critique of the strike was notable for its rarity in the right-wing media landscape. Fox News, in particular, has been a staunch supporter of Trump and his policies, with some hosts even serving as informal advisors to the president. But Carlson, who has a history of taking positions that are at odds with his network and party, refused to toe the line on this issue.
In a monologue on his show, Carlson argued that the strike was ill-conceived and potentially disastrous. He criticized the administration for failing to consult with Congress before taking action, and for exaggerating the threat posed by Soleimani. He also warned that the strike could lead to a wider conflict in the Middle East, and questioned whether it was worth the risk.
“Washington has wanted war with Iran for decades,” Carlson said. “And now, suddenly, we’re supposed to believe that they had to take this drastic step to stop an imminent attack? It doesn’t add up.”
Carlson’s comments drew praise from some on the left, who saw him as a rare voice of reason in the conservative media. But they also drew fierce backlash from many of his colleagues and viewers, who accused him of disloyalty and even treason. Some called for him to be fired from Fox News.
The controversy highlighted the deep divisions within the Republican Party and conservative media over Trump’s foreign policy. While many on the right have praised Trump for his tough stance on Iran and willingness to use military force, others have expressed concern about his impulsiveness and lack of strategic vision.
Some have also accused Trump of betraying the principles of conservatism by abandoning traditional Republican positions on issues like free trade and international alliances. This has led to a split within the conservative movement, with some embracing a more populist, nationalist agenda and others clinging to the old guard.
Carlson, for his part, has positioned himself as a kind of bridge between these two factions. He has praised Trump for his efforts to “drain the swamp” and fight political correctness, but has also criticized him for his foreign policy and tendency to pick fights with allies. He has been an outspoken critic of neoconservative foreign policy, which he sees as a threat to American sovereignty and security.
In the end, the debate over Trump’s Iran strike highlights the larger question facing the conservative movement: What does it stand for? Is it a movement dedicated to free markets and individual liberty, or a movement defined by nationalism and cultural identity? Is it a movement that seeks to preserve the post-World War II international order, or a movement that rejects it in favor of a more isolationist approach?
These are questions that the conservative movement will have to grapple with in the years to come. And with voices like Tucker Carlson challenging the status quo, the debate promises to be lively and contentious.
