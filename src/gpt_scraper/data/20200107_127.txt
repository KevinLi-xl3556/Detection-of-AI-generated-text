Iran ‘Concludes’ Attacks, Foreign Minister Says
On January 8th, 2020, Iran fired multiple missiles at US military bases in Iraq, following the US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. The attack raised tensions between the US and Iran, with worries that it could escalate into a wider conflict.
However, on January 9th, Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted that Iran had “concluded” its attacks and did not seek an escalation of the situation. He also stated that Iran had acted in self-defense and that their goal was to protect their citizens and forces in the region.
The move could be seen as an attempt by Iran to de-escalate the situation and avoid a further military clash with the US. The US had earlier stated that it did not want an escalation of the situation either, but had warned of a strong response to any further attacks.
The attacks were seen as a significant escalation in the conflict between the US and Iran, and led to fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. The US President, Donald Trump, had earlier tweeted that “All is well!” and “So far, so good!” following the attacks, but also warned of a strong response if Iran continued to escalate the situation.
The situation remains tense, with both sides likely to remain vigilant and prepared for further attacks. However, the de-escalation by Iran could provide a chance for talks to begin and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
It is important for both sides to remember that diplomacy must always be the preferred option for resolving conflicts. War only leads to destruction and loss of life, and should be avoided at all costs.
The world will be watching over the coming days and weeks to see how the situation develops. Let us hope that both sides can find a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict, without further violence or loss of human life.
