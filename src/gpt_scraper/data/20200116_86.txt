In 2016, Makoto Shinkai’s anime film “Your Name” took the world by storm, breaking box office records and earning critical acclaim. Now, Shinkai has returned with his latest anime film: “Weathering With You.”
Set in Tokyo, “Weathering With You” tells the story of Hodaka Morishima, a 16-year-old runaway who moves to the city in search of a better future. When he arrives, Hodaka discovers that Tokyo is experiencing a never-ending rainstorm. However, he also meets Hina Amano, a young girl with the ability to manipulate the weather.
From the very first frame, it is clear that “Weathering With You” is a visual feast. The film’s animation is breathtaking, with stunningly detailed backgrounds and character designs that are both charming and expressive. The rain that dominates the film’s Tokyo setting is particularly well-rendered, creating a moody and immersive atmosphere that draws the viewer in.
The film’s story is also a strong point. “Weathering With You” deals with themes of loneliness, loss, and love, all wrapped up in a story that is both engaging and emotionally resonant. While some of the plot points may be predictable to seasoned anime fans, the film’s strong characters and well-paced narrative keep things fresh and engaging throughout.
Of course, no discussion of “Weathering With You” would be complete without mentioning the film’s soundtrack. Once again, Shinkai has teamed up with composer Radwimps, who also worked on the score for “Your Name.” The resulting music is a perfect complement to the film’s visuals, with soaring melodies and heartfelt lyrics that will stay with you long after the credits roll.
Overall, “Weathering With You” is a triumph. It is a beautiful and heartfelt film that showcases anime at its best. While it may not reach the same heights as “Your Name,” it is still a must-see for anime fans and a strong contender for one of the best films of the year. Let the sun shine in, because this is a film that deserves all the praise it gets.
