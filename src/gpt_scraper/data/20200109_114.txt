In times of revolution and political turmoil, food has often played an unexpected role. From tear-gas gelato to foulmouthed mooncakes, cuisine has been weaponized to make a statement or to provide a much-needed respite from the chaos. Let’s take a look at some of the most notable examples of foods fit for a revolution.
Tear-Gas Gelato
During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a local gelato shop decided to create a flavor that reflected the tumultuous events happening around them. The result was tear-gas gelato, a minty-green concoction that included pepper spray residue as an ingredient. The gelato shop’s owner, Kavon Wong, explained that the flavor was meant to raise awareness about the use of tear gas by police during the protests. While some criticized the flavor as trivializing a serious issue, others saw it as a creative way to draw attention to the situation.
Foulmouthed Mooncakes
Mooncakes are a traditional Chinese pastry that are typically eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, activists used mooncakes to make a political statement. They created a limited-edition set of mooncakes with messages inscribed on them, including phrases like “I want genuine universal suffrage” and “Occupy Central with Love and Peace.” The mooncakes were also filled with offensive words directed at the Chinese government. While the foul language on the mooncakes generated controversy, they were seen as a powerful way to express dissent.
Revolutionary Soup
In 2011, during the Arab Spring, a soup kitchen in Tahrir Square became a symbol of the Egyptian revolution. The kitchen served free soup to protesters who were camped out in the square, and it became a meeting place for activists and organizers. The soup kitchen was run by a group of volunteers who were inspired to take action after seeing the widespread poverty in Egypt. They saw the soup kitchen as a way to help those in need and to create a sense of community among the protesters.
Protest Pizza
In 2020, as protests swept across the United States in response to the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis pizza shop became a hub for activists. The shop, called Pizza Nea, started offering free pizzas to protesters who were demonstrating peacefully. The owner, Mike Sherwood, said he wanted to support the movement in any way he could, and he saw pizza as a way to bring people together. The shop became a popular spot for protesters to take a break and refuel, and it garnered national attention for its efforts.
In conclusion, food has a unique ability to unite people and to make a statement. From tear-gas gelato to protest pizza, these foods reflect the passions and ideals of their creators. While they may not be to everyone’s taste, they serve as a reminder that in times of revolution, even the simplest act can have profound meaning.
