As U.S.-Iran Tensions Flare, Iraq Is Caught in the Middle
Iraq has long been a battleground for regional and international powers vying for influence in the Middle East. In recent years, the country has been the stage for the latest iteration of the ongoing power struggle between the United States and Iran. With tensions between these two countries reaching new heights, Iraq finds itself caught in the middle once again.
The roots of this conflict date back to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime created a power vacuum that both the U.S. and Iran sought to fill. The U.S. attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, but its military presence and support for certain factions only fueled sectarian tensions and helped create an environment in which Iran could expand its influence.
Iran, for its part, saw an opportunity to expand its influence in the region through its support for Shia groups in Iraq. The government in Tehran has long viewed Iraq as a vital strategic ally, and has sought to keep the country within its sphere of influence. This has included providing financial, military, and political support to Shia militias in Iraq.
Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have ebbed and flowed since the invasion. However, in recent years, the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran and the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 have caused relations between the two countries to reach new lows. In response, Iran has increased its support for Shia militias in Iraq, leading to an uptick in attacks on U.S. personnel and installations in the country.
This has put Iraq in a difficult position. The government in Baghdad has sought to maintain good relations with both the U.S. and Iran, but this is becoming increasingly difficult as tensions escalate. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has tried to balance his country’s competing interests by engaging with both sides, but this approach has been met with criticism from both the U.S. and Iran.
For the U.S., Iraq is a vital partner in the fight against ISIS and a bulwark against Iranian expansionism. However, the U.S. presence in Iraq is increasingly unpopular among Iraqis, who see it as a violation of their sovereignty. The recent decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq is a recognition of this fact, but it also leaves Iraq vulnerable to Iranian influence.
For Iran, Iraq is a key ally in the region and a way to project its power beyond its borders. However, Iran’s support for Shia militias in Iraq is a double-edged sword. While these militias have helped Iran expand its influence, they have also created a backlash among Iraqis who resent their interference in their country’s affairs.
The situation in Iraq is further complicated by the fact that the country is facing its own internal challenges. A struggling economy, high unemployment, and widespread corruption have fueled protests against the government. The COVID-19 pandemic has only added to these challenges, further straining an already fragile state.
In this context, the last thing Iraq needs is to become the battleground for a regional proxy war between the U.S. and Iran. Both countries need to recognize that their actions in Iraq have consequences for the Iraqi people, who have already suffered enough from decades of conflict and instability.
To avoid further escalation, the U.S. and Iran need to find a way to de-escalate tensions and engage in constructive dialogue. This will require both sides to make compromises and recognize the legitimate interests of the other. For Iraq’s part, the government in Baghdad needs to assert its own sovereignty and work to build a strong, independent state that can resist external interference.
In the end, the fate of Iraq rests in the hands of its own people. They have the power to determine
