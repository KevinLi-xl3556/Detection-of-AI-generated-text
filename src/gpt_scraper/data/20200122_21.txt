In the recent Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts sent a clear message with his actions: he has a limited role in the proceedings. This message came in the form of a rebuke to the House impeachment managers who had called for him to intervene in the trial.
Initially, there was uncertainty as to whether Roberts would even preside over the trial, given that Trump was no longer president. The Constitution specifies that “when the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.” However, some legal experts argued that since Trump was no longer president, the trial was not constitutional and therefore Roberts should not be involved.
Despite this debate, Roberts ultimately did preside over the trial. However, he made it clear from the outset that he saw his role as limited. In his opening remarks, he emphasized that he was there to “perform a constitutionally prescribed role” and that he would not “sway the outcome” of the trial.
The House impeachment managers, however, seemed to have a different idea of Roberts’ role. They objected when he initially refused to read aloud a question from Senator Rand Paul which contained the name of the alleged whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal. They argued that Roberts had a duty to protect the whistleblower’s identity and should have refused to read the question.
Roberts, however, pushed back against this interpretation of his role. In a rare rebuke, he reminded the House managers that it was the Senate’s responsibility to decide what questions to ask, not his. “The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted,” he said.
This rebuke was significant because it signaled Roberts’ view that he was not there to act as a referee between the House managers and Trump’s defense team. Instead, he saw his role as simply presiding over the trial and leaving the decision-making to the senators.
Of course, Roberts’ limited role in the trial did not stop some senators from speculating about his potential influence. There were reports that some Democrats hoped he would use his role to try to persuade Republicans to vote for conviction. Similarly, some Republicans expressed concern that Roberts might try to steer the trial in a way that would be advantageous to the Democrats.
Ultimately, however, these fears proved unfounded. Roberts remained largely in the background throughout the trial, occasionally intervening to remind senators to behave appropriately, but otherwise staying out of the fray.
In the end, the Senate voted to acquit Trump, with seven Republicans joining all Democrats in voting to convict. While the outcome was not surprising, some legal experts noted that Roberts’ limited role in the trial may have contributed to the lack of drama and spectacle that had characterized previous impeachments.
Overall, Roberts’ rebuke of the House impeachment managers underscored his view that he had a narrow role to play in the trial. While some had hoped he might use his position to influence the outcome, he ultimately stayed true to his constitutional role as a presiding officer, leaving the decision-making to the senators.
