John Pawasarat Dies at 70; Used Data to Address Social Ills
John Pawasarat, a prominent figure in the field of data analysis and social justice, passed away at the age of 70. Pawasarat was known for his innovative use of data to address social issues, and his impact on the field of social science research will be felt for years to come.
Pawasarat was born in 1953 in rural Thailand. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok before moving to the United States to pursue graduate studies. He earned a master’s degree in statistics from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago.
Throughout his career, Pawasarat focused on using data to understand and address social problems, including poverty, inequality, and discrimination. He was a pioneer in the use of big data and machine learning to analyze social phenomena and was known for his interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, and other social sciences.
One of Pawasarat’s most notable contributions was the development of a new method for measuring poverty. Traditional measures of poverty are based on income, but Pawasarat argued that this approach was too narrow and failed to capture the full range of deprivations experienced by poor people. His method, which used data on housing conditions, health outcomes, and other indicators of well-being, provided a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of poverty.
Pawasarat’s work had real-world impact. He collaborated with policymakers and advocacy groups to develop evidence-based solutions to social problems. He served as an advisor to the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, and other international organizations. He also founded and directed the Data Center for Social Justice at the University of California, San Francisco, which provides data analysis and technical assistance to community organizations working on social justice issues.
Pawasarat was widely recognized for his contributions to the field of social science research. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Margaret Mead Award from the American Anthropological Association and the Distinguished Contributions to Sociological Practice Award from the American Sociological Association. He was also a fellow of the American Statistical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Pawasarat’s legacy will continue through the many researchers and practitioners he trained and influenced over the course of his career. His commitment to using data to promote social justice serves as an inspiration to those who seek to make the world a more just and equitable place.
