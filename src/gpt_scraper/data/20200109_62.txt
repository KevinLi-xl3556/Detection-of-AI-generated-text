Washington D.C. - In a historic vote, the House of Representatives passed a bill to restrain President Donald Trump’s powers to take military action against Iran without congressional approval. The bill passed with a 224-194 vote along mostly partisan lines, with a handful of Republicans crossing over to vote with the Democrats.
The bill, called the No War Against Iran Act, was introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in response to the U.S. killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January without the approval of Congress. The attack nearly sparked a war between the U.S. and Iran, putting millions of lives at risk.
“This bill makes it clear that Congress has the sole power to declare war, as written in the Constitution,” said Khanna during the House debate. “We need to rein in this president, who has shown himself to be impulsive, reckless, and eager for conflict.”
Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, stating that the country is a threat to U.S. national security. His administration has also imposed several rounds of sanctions on Iran, devastating the country’s economy.
However, the bill may face a veto from Trump, who has shown little regard for congressional approval for military action in the past. Even if the bill passes the Senate, it will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the potential veto.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has praised the bill for upholding Congressional authority and protecting American lives. “Today, we are taking a giant step forward in protecting American lives and defending our democracy,” Pelosi said in a statement. “We must keep up the pressure to prevent another reckless war.”
The passing of the No War Against Iran Act is a significant bipartisan effort to curb Trump’s war powers and reinforce Congress’s constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. It sends a clear message to the administration that any future military actions against Iran must first receive explicit approval from Congress.
Regardless of Trump’s potential veto, the passage of the bill demonstrates Congress’s resolve in challenging the administration’s march towards a possible war with Iran. It is a step towards peace and diplomacy, which could prevent devastating consequences for the region and the world.
