On Saturday, the 4th of January, a deadly airstrike was carried out at a Libyan military academy in the capital city of Tripoli, leaving at least 30 people dead and 33 others injured.
The military academy is located in the southwest suburb of the Libyan capital city, and is known to be the base of the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar. The LNA has been trying to take control of Tripoli and overthrow the internationally recognized government since April last year.
According to the LNA, the airstrike was conducted by the rival Government of National Accord (GNA), which the LNA accuses of being backed by Islamist militants. The LNA says that they had detected and intercepted the GNA drone that carried out the attack, but it managed to hit its target before being destroyed.
The GNA, however, has denied any responsibility for the airstrike, and has accused the LNA of being behind it, saying that the attack was aimed at civilians.
The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) has strongly condemned the airstrike, calling it a “blatant violation” of international humanitarian law. The mission has called for an immediate investigation into the incident and for those responsible to be held accountable.
The incident has further escalated the conflict in Libya, which has been ongoing since the overthrow of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The country is now divided between two rival governments, with the internationally recognized GNA based in Tripoli, and the LNA controlling much of eastern Libya.
The situation in Libya is further complicated by the involvement of various foreign powers, including Turkey, Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, who are backing different factions in the conflict. The UN has been trying to broker a ceasefire and a political solution to the crisis, but so far, its efforts have not yielded any significant results.
The airstrike at the military academy is a stark reminder of the human cost of the ongoing conflict in Libya. It is yet another tragedy that underscores the urgent need for all parties to put aside their differences and work towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The international community must also do more to support the efforts of the UN and to hold those responsible for human rights violations and war crimes accountable.
