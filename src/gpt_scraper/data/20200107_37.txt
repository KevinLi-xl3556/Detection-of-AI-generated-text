On November 10th, 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, an elected government was overthrown in a violent coup d’etat led by white supremacists. The event has been referred to as the only successful coup d’etat in the history of the United States of America.
At the time, Wilmington was the largest city in North Carolina and had a thriving African-American community. The city had a freed black population that had achieved success in business, politics, and education. This growing success was seen as a threat to white supremacists, who were striving to maintain political power and control over the black population.
The white supremacists had planned the coup for months, publishing inflammatory articles in local newspapers and holding rallies to spread their message of hate and intolerance. On November 10th, they put their plan into action, using violence and intimidation to overthrow the elected government and install their own leaders in power.
The violence started early in the day when a mob of armed white men burned down the local black newspaper office. They then proceeded to attack the neighborhoods and businesses of the black community, destroying property and terrorizing residents. The mayor and other black elected officials were forced to flee for their lives, and the white supremacist leaders established a new government as the city’s new authority.
The aftermath of the coup was devastating for the black community. Over 2,000 African-American citizens were driven out of the city, and many more were forced to live under the oppressive laws of the new government. Freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, such as voting, were stripped away from black citizens, driving them deeper into poverty and oppression.
The Wilmington coup was a turning point in American history. It represented a dark and shameful chapter in the ongoing struggle for civil rights and equality. It also served as a warning of the dangers of white supremacy and the importance of never letting history repeat itself.
Today, the story of the Wilmington coup is often overlooked in history books, but it serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for justice in America. We must embrace the lessons of our past and work towards a future where all voices, regardless of race, are heard and valued.
