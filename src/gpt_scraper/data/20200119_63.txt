Corrections: Jan. 19, 2020
As a responsible news publication, we believe it is our duty to correct any inaccuracies that may have appeared in our previous articles. Here are the corrections for Jan. 19, 2020.


In the article “Local Business Owner Wins Award for Community Service,” we incorrectly stated that the business owner had donated $1 million to a local charity. The correct amount is $100,000. We apologize for the error.


In the article “New Study Reveals Surprising Benefits of Meditation,” we mistakenly attributed the study to the wrong university. The study was actually conducted by researchers at Harvard, not Yale. We regret the mistake and have updated the article accordingly.


In the article “Police Identify Suspect in Bank Robbery,” we included a photo of an innocent individual instead of the actual suspect. We deeply apologize to the wrongly identified individual and have removed the photo from our website.
