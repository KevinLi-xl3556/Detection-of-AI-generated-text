The Boeing Company, one of the world’s largest aerospace and defense corporations, has been making headlines for several years now due to a series of crises, including two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft. The company’s former CEO, Dennis A. Muilenburg, was at the helm during these crises and was ultimately dismissed from his position. However, recent reports indicate that despite his firing, Muilenburg will receive a hefty severance package worth more than $60 million.
Muilenburg’s dismissal from Boeing came in December 2019 after a year of intense scrutiny following the crashes of two 737 MAX planes. The crashes, which occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia, claimed the lives of 346 people and were attributed to a software issue in the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). Muilenburg’s handling of the crisis, including his initial reluctance to ground the 737 MAX fleet, drew widespread criticism and ultimately led to his ousting.
Despite the circumstances of his departure, Muilenburg’s severance package reportedly includes $29.4 million in cash and stock awards, as well as an additional $31.3 million in pension benefits and deferred compensation. This amount has sparked outrage among some industry experts and the public, who question the morality of such a large payout to a CEO who oversaw such a significant crisis.
Boeing, for its part, defended Muilenburg’s severance package, stating that it was calculated based on a formula established by the company’s board of directors. The formula takes into account factors such as the executive’s length of service, the circumstances of their departure, and their performance during their tenure.
While Muilenburg’s severance package may seem exorbitant, it is not uncommon for high-level executives to receive large payouts upon their departure from a company. In fact, according to a study by the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, the median severance payout for CEOs of S&P 500 companies in 2018 was $12 million. This amount was down slightly from the previous year but still represents a significant sum.
The controversy surrounding Muilenburg’s severance package underscores the growing scrutiny over executive pay and the role of corporate leaders in the face of crisis. As companies face increasing pressure to prioritize social and environmental responsibility, the public is paying closer attention to the actions of top executives and holding them accountable for their decisions.
In the case of Boeing, the fallout from the 737 MAX crisis has been significant, with the company facing billions of dollars in losses and a damaged reputation. As it moves forward under new leadership, the company will need to address not only the technical issues with its aircraft but also the broader ethical and governance concerns that have emerged in the wake of the crisis.
In conclusion, while Muilenburg’s severance package may seem excessive, it is not unusual in the world of executive compensation. However, it does raise important questions about the role of corporate leaders and the responsibility they bear in times of crisis. As companies face mounting pressure to prioritize ethical and sustainable practices, the public will likely continue to demand greater accountability from top executives and scrutiny over their compensation.
