In recent years, there has been a lot of debate about the effectiveness of food stamps or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the United States. While some people believe that SNAP is a vital safety net for people who are struggling to make ends meet, others argue that it encourages dependence and waste. In 2015, one state, Maine, decided to make it harder for its residents to access food stamps. What happened as a result?
Before we dive into the consequences of Maine’s decision, let’s first take a look at what the state did. In 2015, Maine’s governor, Paul LePage, instituted a series of changes to the state’s SNAP program. The most significant change was that adults without children who were able-bodied and not working at least 20 hours a week would no longer be eligible for SNAP benefits. The idea behind this change was to encourage people to find work and reduce dependence on government assistance.
So, what happened when Maine made it harder to get food stamps? The results were mixed, and the impact on individuals and the economy was complicated. Here are some of the key takeaways:


Enrollment in SNAP decreased: As expected, the number of people enrolled in SNAP in Maine decreased significantly after the changes went into effect. According to the USDA, the number of people receiving SNAP benefits in Maine dropped by almost 80% between 2014 and 2018.


Hunger increased: Unfortunately, reducing the number of people on SNAP also meant that more people in Maine went hungry. According to a report by the Food Research and Action Center, Maine had the highest rate of food insecurity in New England in 2017. In fact, food insecurity in Maine increased by 40% between 2014 and 2018.


The economy was impacted: There is evidence to suggest that reducing SNAP benefits can have a negative impact on the economy. When people have less money to spend on food, they are less likely to spend money on other goods and services, which can lead to a ripple effect throughout the local economy. A study by the University of Maine found that every $1 in SNAP benefits generates $1.70 in economic activity.


Finding work wasn’t easy: While the idea behind the changes was to encourage people to find work, the reality is that finding a job isn’t always easy. According to the Maine Center for Economic Policy, Maine’s economy has been slow to recover from the Great Recession, and there simply aren’t enough jobs available to meet the demand. In fact, the majority of the people who lost their SNAP benefits in Maine were not able to find work and remained unemployed or underemployed.


The changes were controversial: Finally, it’s worth noting that Maine’s changes to its SNAP program were controversial and drew criticism from many quarters. Advocates for the poor argued that the changes were cruel and unnecessary, while others saw them as a way to reduce government waste and encourage self-sufficiency.


In conclusion, what happened when Maine made food stamps harder to get? The results were mixed, with fewer people enrolled in SNAP, more people going hungry, and a complicated impact on the economy. While some may see the changes as a success, it’s clear that reducing government assistance is not a panacea for poverty and hunger. As we continue to debate the role of food stamps in our society, it’s important to consider the complex and often unpredictable consequences of policy changes.
