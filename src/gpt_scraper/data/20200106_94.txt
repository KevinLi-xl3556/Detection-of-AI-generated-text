Carlos Ghosn’s Escape Preparations Spanned the Globe
In late 2019, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn made headlines around the world when he was arrested in Japan on charges of financial misconduct. But what followed his arrest was even more surprising: Ghosn managed to escape Japan and flee to Lebanon, where he remains to this day. How did he do it? It turns out that Ghosn’s escape preparations spanned the globe, involving a network of people and resources in multiple countries.
Ghosn’s escape began to take shape shortly after he was arrested in November 2019. He was held in a Tokyo jail for over 100 days, during which time he was subjected to daily interrogations and held in solitary confinement. Meanwhile, his lawyers were fighting to get him released on bail, but their efforts were repeatedly denied by Japanese authorities.
As the weeks dragged on, Ghosn became increasingly desperate to escape. He began looking for ways to flee the country, even as his lawyers continued to argue his case in court. His first step was to reach out to a group of former special forces operatives in the United States. These men had experience in extraction operations and had helped free hostages in war-torn countries around the world. Ghosn contacted them through a mutual acquaintance and asked for their help in getting him out of Japan.
The ex-special forces operatives agreed to help, but they needed a way to get Ghosn out of the country undetected. That’s where a group of Lebanese expatriates living in Japan came in. They had connections to the Lebanese embassy in Tokyo and were able to get Ghosn a new passport under a fake name. With the help of a private jet, Ghosn was flown from Tokyo to Istanbul, where he was met by another group of operatives.
From there, Ghosn was taken to Lebanon, where he has citizenship and where he has been living ever since. But getting him out of Japan was only the first step in a complex and highly orchestrated plan. Ghosn’s escape preparations involved multiple people in multiple countries, each with a specific role to play.
For example, the private jet that transported Ghosn from Tokyo to Istanbul was owned by a company based in Dubai. The jet was rented through a private aviation company in Paris, which was run by a friend of Ghosn’s. The operatives who helped Ghosn escape also came from multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, and France.
All of this required a great deal of coordination and planning. Ghosn’s escape was not a spur-of-the-moment decision, but rather the result of months of careful preparation. And even after he arrived in Lebanon, Ghosn continued to take precautions to ensure his safety. He hired a team of former Israeli intelligence operatives to provide him with security and protection, and he has kept a low profile ever since.
In the end, Ghosn’s escape from Japan was a remarkable feat of planning and execution. It involved a network of people and resources in multiple countries, all working together to help him evade the authorities and find a new life in Lebanon. Whether he will ever face justice for the charges against him remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Ghosn’s escape will go down in history as one of the most audacious and daring in recent memory.
