The United States has announced its decision to expel a dozen Saudi military trainees following the deadly shooting at the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. The move comes after an investigation into the incident revealed that the shooter, who was also a Saudi military trainee, had extremist views.
The Pensacola shooting occurred in December 2019 when Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, a Saudi Arabian Air Force officer, opened fire at a classroom on the base, killing three U.S. sailors and injuring eight other people before he was killed by law enforcement. The attack shocked the nation and raised questions about the vetting process for foreign military trainees who come to the United States to receive training.
In response to the shooting, the U.S. government launched a review of all Saudi military personnel training in the United States. The review found that a number of Saudi trainees had extremist views, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) identified 21 Saudi nationals who had shared extremist material online.
As a result, the U.S. government announced that 21 Saudi trainees would be expelled from the program, and the remaining trainees would undergo enhanced screening and monitoring. The decision to expel a dozen trainees is part of this broader effort to improve the vetting process and prevent future attacks.
The move has been criticized by some who argue that it undermines the longstanding relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. However, others argue that it is necessary to ensure the safety and security of U.S. military installations.
In a statement, the U.S. Department of Defense emphasized that the expulsion of the trainees does not reflect on the Saudi Arabian government as a whole, but rather on the individuals who were found to have extremist views.
“The actions taken by the DOJ today reflect the fact that the safety of our personnel is a top priority,” the statement read. “The U.S. government remains committed to maintaining strong security and defense cooperation with Saudi Arabia.”
The decision to expel the trainees also highlights the ongoing debate about the U.S. military’s relationship with Saudi Arabia, particularly in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Some lawmakers have called for an end to U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, citing concerns about human rights abuses and the civilian death toll.
While the U.S. government has taken steps to improve the vetting process for foreign military trainees, the Pensacola shooting serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with hosting foreign military personnel on U.S. soil. As the U.S. military continues to engage in global partnerships and training programs, ensuring the safety and security of American personnel must remain a top priority.
