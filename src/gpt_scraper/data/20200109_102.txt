“Afterward” is a documentary film directed by Ofra Bloch, which explores the long-lasting impact of the Holocaust on both Jewish and non-Jewish communities. The film delves into the question of how Germans and Palestinians view the Holocaust and its consequences, and how their perspectives have been shaped by their respective histories.
One of the most striking aspects of the film is its emphasis on dialogue and conversation. Bloch sets out to engage in a series of conversations with Germans and Palestinians, seeking to understand how they perceive the Holocaust and its aftermath. Through these conversations, she hopes to foster a greater sense of empathy and understanding between different cultures and communities.
The film’s title, “Afterward,” reflects this theme of dialogue and reflection. Bloch suggests that the only way to move forward from the traumas of the past is to engage in a process of reflection and introspection. By asking difficult questions and listening to different perspectives, she believes that we can begin to heal the wounds of the past and build a more peaceful and just world.
One of the most moving segments of the film involves Bloch’s conversations with Israeli settlers in the West Bank. These settlers, who are often seen as the embodiment of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, express their own sense of vulnerability and fear in the face of ongoing conflict. By giving voice to their experiences, Bloch challenges viewers to question their own assumptions and biases about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Ultimately, “Afterward” is a powerful and thought-provoking film that challenges viewers to think deeply about the complex issues of history, trauma, and identity. By engaging in a process of dialogue and reflection, Bloch suggests that we can begin to overcome the barriers that separate us and build a more just and compassionate world.
Asking for the opinions of Jews and Israelis is an important part of this process. By engaging with different perspectives and hearing from a wide range of voices, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the ongoing trauma of the Holocaust. “Afterward” is an important contribution to this ongoing conversation, and a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding in our fractured world.
