Harry, Meghan and Britain: When Did the Fairy Tale Go Sour?
Once upon a time, there was a prince who fell in love with an actress from America. They met through a mutual friend, had a secret romance, and eventually got married in a grand ceremony watched by millions around the world. For a while, it seemed like a modern fairy tale that blended tradition and diversity, hope and joy, into a happy ending. However, as time passed, the story took a different turn, with conflicts, controversies, and tensions that threatened to tarnish the royal image and strain the family ties. So, when did the fairy tale of Harry and Meghan go sour?
One possible answer is that the seeds of discord were planted early on, when the couple faced scrutiny and criticism from the media, the public, and even some members of the royal household. Meghan, as a biracial and divorced woman, faced more scrutiny and criticism than Harry, who was already known for his rebellious streak and his struggles with mental health and media intrusion. The intense spotlight that followed their courtship, engagement, and marriage put pressure on them to conform to certain expectations, traditions, and protocols, and also exposed them to racist, sexist, and hostile comments and stories. This put a strain on their mental health, privacy, and dignity, and made them question their place and role in the royal family.
Another possible answer is that the fairy tale of Harry and Meghan went sour when they decided to step back from their royal duties and seek financial independence. This came as a shock to many, especially as it was announced on social media without prior consultation or approval from the Queen or the palace. The announcement also revealed some underlying tensions and disagreements between Harry and Meghan, on one side, and the rest of the royal family, on the other side, regarding their ambitions, vision, and values. The decision to move to North America, set up a new foundation, and sign commercial deals with Netflix and Spotify also raised questions about their motives, loyalty, and integrity, and challenged the unwritten rules and codes of conduct that govern the royal family.
A third possible answer is that the fairy tale of Harry and Meghan went sour due to a combination of external and internal factors, including political shifts, cultural differences, personal struggles, and human flaws. Brexit, Trump, and the pandemic reshaped the geopolitical landscape and put pressure on Britain and its monarchy to renew and redefine their role and identity in a changing world. The Black Lives Matter movement, the MeToo movement, and the climate crisis also highlighted social and environmental issues that affected peopleâ€™s lives and demanded action and compassion. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan faced their own challenges and dilemmas, such as dealing with the aftermath of losing his mother at a young age, coping with the demands of royal life, adjusting to a new marriage and motherhood, and navigating their own values and passions in relation to their public duties and responsibilities.
So, when did the fairy tale of Harry and Meghan go sour? The answer is not straightforward or simple, as it involves multiple factors and perspectives that reflect the complexities and contradictions of our times. However, what is clear is that the challenges and controversies that Harry and Meghan faced in the past few years reflect deeper issues that affect not only British society, but also human society as a whole. These issues include the tension between tradition and diversity, between duty and freedom, between privacy and publicity, and between power and empathy. Whether or not the fairy tale of Harry and Meghan can be restored or replaced by a better one depends not only on the actions and decisions of individuals, but also on the collective values and visions of society.
