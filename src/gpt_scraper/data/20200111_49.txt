For decades, the late astronomer Vera Rubin struggled to gain recognition in the male-dominated field of astronomy. Despite her groundbreaking work on dark matter, a substance that makes up a significant portion of the universe, Rubin was often overlooked and sometimes outright dismissed. But now, she is finally receiving the recognition she deserves, as a new telescope has been named in her honor.
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, located in Chile, will be the world’s largest telescope once it becomes fully operational in 2024. It will have a unique ability to survey large swaths of the sky every few nights, and will be able to detect faint objects that other telescopes can’t.
Rubin, who died in 2016 at age 88, was a pioneer in the field of astronomy. In the 1970s, she made a significant discovery that changed the way scientists think about the universe. Rubin and her colleagues were studying the speeds of stars in galaxies, expecting to find that the stars near the edges of a galaxy would slow down in accordance with Newton’s laws of motion. But instead, they found that the stars were moving at the same speed regardless of their distance from the center of the galaxy. This meant that there must be a significant amount of mass in the galaxy that they couldn’t see, which Rubin referred to as “dark matter.”
Despite the groundbreaking nature of her discovery, Rubin faced many obstacles in her career. She was often the only woman in a room full of male astronomers, and she was routinely dismissed or ignored by her colleagues. In 1993, she was awarded the National Medal of Science, but it wasn’t until after her death that her contributions to the field were fully recognized.
The Rubin Observatory will serve as a tribute to Rubin’s legacy, and will hopefully inspire more women to pursue careers in astronomy. In an industry that has historically been dominated by men, it’s important to honor the trailblazers who have come before us and to create opportunities for the next generation of scientists.
The telescope will also help to further our understanding of the universe. With its ability to survey large portions of the sky and detect faint objects, the Rubin Observatory could lead to new discoveries about dark matter, the origins of the universe, and the nature of black holes.
Vera Rubin was a remarkable scientist who overcame numerous obstacles to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the universe. The Rubin Observatory serves as a fitting tribute to her legacy, and a reminder that even in a field where women have historically been underrepresented, their contributions are valuable and deserve recognition.
