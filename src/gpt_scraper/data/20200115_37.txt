The baseball community was rocked by the recent cheating scandal that has claimed two managers’ jobs; Carlos Beltran, a former player, was heavily implicated in the scandal. Beltran, who was set to become the new manager of the New York Mets, has had a murky future ever since.
Beltran was hired in November 2019 to lead the Mets, but after the scandal broke, he had to step down from his role. Beltran was accused of being involved in a scheme to steal signs during his time with the Houston Astros in 2017. The scandal involved using video technology to decode opponents’ signs and relay them to hitters in real-time.
Beltran was a key member of the Astros team that won the 2017 World Series, and though he denied the allegations, the team’s findings put him in a bad light. He was named 11 times in the report, and his role was deemed decisive in the scheme. The scandal led to the suspension of Astros manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow, and eventually cost them their jobs.
Beltran, who was a player at the time, was not punished, which outraged many in the baseball world. However, his reputation took a hit, and the Mets had to let him go, as the franchise could not handle the backlash associated with his involvement in the scandal.
Currently, Beltran is out of the game, and his future is uncertain. It is unclear if he will ever be able to return to baseball in a managerial capacity, and if he does, whether teams will be willing to take a risk on him.
The irony of the whole situation is that Beltran is regarded as one of the best players in baseball history. He was an All-Star nine times, won three Gold Gloves, and was a prolific hitter, with 435 home runs and a career batting average of .279.
However, his involvement in the scandal has overshadowed his achievements on the field, and it remains to be seen if he can ever bask in the adulation of his peers again.
In the end, the scandal has been a dark chapter in the baseball world, and it has claimed many casualties. The careers of Hinch and Luhnow are in tatters, and Beltran has been left in the lurch. Only time will tell what the future holds for them, but for now, the future is murky.
