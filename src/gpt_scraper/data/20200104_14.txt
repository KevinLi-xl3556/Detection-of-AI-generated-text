On January 3, 2020, the United States carried out a targeted drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, a prominent Iranian general, in Baghdad, Iraq. The attack sent shockwaves throughout the region and sparked a wave of outrage among Iranians who closed ranks behind their leaders in response.
Soleimani was widely seen as a hero in Iran, having led the Quds Force, a unit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for over two decades. He was a key figure in Iran’s efforts to expand its influence in the Middle East and was responsible for coordinating Iran’s support for Shia militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Assad regime in Syria.
Following his death, Iranians from all walks of life came out in force to mourn Soleimani and express their anger at the United States. Thousands attended his funeral procession in Tehran, chanting “Death to America” and burning American flags.
Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed revenge for Soleimani’s death and ordered missile strikes on two US military bases in Iraq in retaliation. The strikes caused no casualties, but marked a significant escalation in tensions between Iran and the United States.
Despite the danger of further escalation, many Iranians remained steadfast in their support of their leaders and their response to Soleimani’s killing. In the days following the attack, Iranian officials used the incident to rally support for the regime and denounce the United States as a hostile and aggressive power.
President Hassan Rouhani called Soleimani a “great martyr” and praised his contributions to Iran’s defense and foreign policy. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described the attack as an act of terrorism and accused the United States of violating international law and norms.
Even opposition figures, who have been critical of the regime’s handling of domestic affairs, rallied behind their leaders in the face of the US threat. Reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh called Soleimani’s death a “national catastrophe” and urged Iranians to support their government’s response.
The outpouring of support for Iran’s leaders in the wake of Soleimani’s death reflects the deep sense of national pride and identity that runs through Iranian society. Despite political divisions and social challenges, Iranians are fiercely proud of their country and its history, and are willing to defend it against perceived threats from outside.
The US drone strike on Soleimani may have been intended to weaken Iran’s military and political influence in the region, but it has had the opposite effect of strengthening the resolve of the Iranian people and their leaders. As Iran and the United States continue to engage in a complex and fraught relationship, it is clear that Iranians will continue to close ranks behind their leaders in the face of external threats.
