In a time where immigration is a hotly debated issue in many countries, television has become a platform to showcase the immigrant experience. Two recent shows that have done that remarkably well are “Party of Five” and “Little America”.
“Party of Five” is a reboot of the classic 90s television show about five siblings who are left to fend for themselves in San Francisco after their parents are deported back to Mexico. The show tackles issues such as assimilation, family separation, and societal stigma. With the addition of modern-day politics, the show is an excellent representation of immigrant life in America today.
The revamped series is a more intense and emotional portrayal of the immigrant experience. In one episode, the eldest sibling, Lucia, is struggling to connect with her new surroundings and is confused by the American values of independence and individualism, which were not part of her upbringing. Another episode deals with the psychological impact of living under the constant fear of deportation.
“Little America” is an anthology series that showcases the stories of immigrants in America. Each episode tells the story of a different individual or family and their journey to the United States. The first season has eight episodes that explore the diverse experiences of immigrants from all over the world. The show tackles issues such as discrimination, entrepreneurship, and adaptability.
The series has received critical acclaim for being one of the most accurate representations of immigrant life in America today. In one episode, the series tells the story of a gay Syrian man who fled his home country and sought asylum in the United States. The episode highlights the obstacles that LGBTQ+ immigrants face in the American refugee system. In another episode, the show depicts a Nigerian man who moves to Utah and becomes a successful entrepreneur after being rejected from multiple job opportunities due to his accent.
Both “Party of Five” and “Little America” have been praised for their authentic representation of the immigrant experience. They not only showcase the challenges and hardships that immigrants face but also offer a sense of hope and resilience. Shows like these are important because they provide a platform for immigrant stories to be heard and create a better understanding of the issues that these communities face.
In a time where immigration policies are constantly changing, shows like “Party of Five” and “Little America” allow us to connect with stories of people who have left everything behind for a better life. These shows are a reminder that the immigrant experience is not just a political issue, but a human rights issue, and they do an outstanding job of telling these compelling stories.
