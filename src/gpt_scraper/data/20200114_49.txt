As Donald Trump’s term as the 45th president of the United States came to a close, comparisons emerged between him and former president Jimmy Carter. Although the two men come from vastly different political backgrounds, their leadership styles could not be more different.
As someone who worked as an aide in Jimmy Carter’s administration, I can confidently say that he is the antithesis of Trump. The contrast in their leadership styles could not be more stark.
Carter was a man of humility, empathy, and authenticity. He cared deeply about the needs of ordinary Americans and worked tirelessly to address their problems. He did not shy away from difficult issues, such as energy policy, foreign relations, and human rights. And unlike Trump, he did not base his decisions primarily on his personal interests or political calculations.
Carter was a moral leader who refused to compromise on his principles. He spoke candidly about the challenges facing the country, including poverty, racism, and inequality. He challenged Americans to be their best selves and to strive for a better future.
In contrast, Trump was known for his brashness, his disregard for facts, and his willingness to play to his base. He used Twitter as a platform for spreading falsehoods and attacking his critics. He alienated our allies and cozied up to authoritarian leaders. And he ignored the plight of millions of Americans who were struggling to make ends meet.
During his presidency, Carter faced many challenges, including economic stagnation, the energy crisis, and the Iran hostage crisis. But he approached each of these challenges with a sense of humility and a willingness to listen to all voices.
He was not afraid to admit his mistakes or to reach out to his opponents. He fostered a culture of collaboration and problem-solving, rather than one of bitterness and division.
As we look ahead to the future, we can learn much from the leadership style of Jimmy Carter. We need leaders who are willing to put the needs of the country ahead of their own interests, who are willing to speak truth to power, and who are willing to work tirelessly for the benefit of all Americans.
We need leaders who are the opposite of Trump in every way. We need leaders who are humble, empathetic, and authentic. We need leaders who are moral and principled, and who refuse to compromise on their values.
In short, we need leaders who are like Jimmy Carter.
