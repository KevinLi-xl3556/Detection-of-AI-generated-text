On January 3, 2020, the world was stunned when news broke that the United States had carried out a drone strike that killed Iran’s top military commander, General Qassem Suleimani. The decision to take out Suleimani, who was considered one of Iran’s most powerful and influential figures, was made by President Donald Trump. The move was met with swift condemnation from around the world, with many warning of dire consequences.
One of the immediate consequences of the Suleimani decision was a significant escalation in tensions between the United States and Iran. Iran vowed to take revenge for the killing of their top general, and just days after the attack, Iran launched missile strikes on two U.S. military bases in Iraq. While there were no casualties, the attack was a clear message that Iran was not backing down.
In addition to the missile strikes, Iran also announced that it would no longer abide by the limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal, which had been negotiated under the Obama administration. The decision to withdraw from the agreement was a significant blow to international efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
The Suleimani decision also had significant regional implications. General Suleimani was considered a key figure in Iran’s efforts to expand its influence throughout the Middle East. His death was seen as a major setback to those efforts and led to a shift in regional power dynamics. Iran’s proxy forces, which were supported by Suleimani, were left without a leader, and the United States and its allies were left to contend with a more unpredictable and unstable situation in the region.
Perhaps the most significant consequence of the Suleimani decision, however, was the damage it did to U.S. credibility and influence on the global stage. The strike was carried out without the approval of Congress, and many saw it as a violation of international law. The decision was also widely criticized by U.S. allies, who saw it as a reckless and dangerous move that could lead to war.
The Trump administration’s decision to take out General Suleimani was a short-sighted and dangerous move that has had dire consequences. It has led to an escalation in tensions with Iran, a significant shift in regional power dynamics, and a damaging blow to U.S. credibility and influence. The decision will continue to reverberate for years to come, and it serves as a cautionary tale of the dangers of reckless and impulsive foreign policy decisions.
