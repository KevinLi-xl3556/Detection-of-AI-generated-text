In 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo found himself in turbulent waters, navigating a global pandemic and a series of political scandals. His leadership and decision-making were put to the test as the state became one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
Cuomo’s response to the pandemic was met with both praise and criticism. He implemented strict lockdown measures and ramped up testing and contact tracing efforts, which helped to slow the spread of the virus. However, his administration was also criticized for its handling of nursing homes and for underreporting COVID-19 deaths in those facilities.
As if the pandemic wasn’t enough, Cuomo was also embroiled in a series of political scandals throughout 2020. In March, he faced backlash for his decision to close the Moreland Commission, a commission he had set up to investigate political corruption in the state. Then, in August, a bombshell report from the New York Attorney General’s office revealed that Cuomo’s administration had underreported the number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.
Despite the scandals, Cuomo remained steadfast in his leadership and continued to make decisions he believed were in the best interest of New Yorkers. In September, he announced a plan to reopen schools, which was met with some resistance from parents and educators who were concerned about the safety of students and staff.
As the year wore on, Cuomo’s approval rating began to decline. A poll conducted by Siena College in December found that 56% of New Yorkers approved of the governor’s handling of the pandemic, down from 77% in April.
One of the most memorable moments of Cuomo’s 2020 was his reference to the pandemic as “so many octopuses” during a press conference in April. “It’s like we’re looking at an octopus,” he said. “This is not a situation where you have one or two tentacles of the octopus that you can control. You’re looking at the whole thing, and it’s everywhere.”
The metaphorical octopus that Cuomo referred to represents the complexity of the pandemic and the challenges that came with trying to contain and mitigate its spread. It’s a reminder that even the most powerful and well-equipped leaders can be overwhelmed by a crisis of this magnitude.
Looking back on Cuomo’s 2020 vision, it’s clear that he faced a number of obstacles and made some missteps along the way. However, his commitment to the people of New York and his willingness to make difficult decisions in the face of adversity cannot be overlooked. As the state continues to navigate the ongoing pandemic, Cuomo’s leadership will undoubtedly be put to the test once again.
