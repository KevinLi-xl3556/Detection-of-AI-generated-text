On January 3rd, 2020, Iran was thrown into mourning as tens of thousands of people flooded the streets of Tehran to pay their last respects to General Qasem Suleimani, the top Iranian military commander who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq just days before. The funeral procession, which lasted for three days and spanned across multiple cities in Iran, was one of the largest displays of public grief the country had seen in decades.
Suleimani was a beloved figure in Iran and beyond, known for his role in shaping Iran’s foreign policy and leading its military operations abroad. He was revered by many as a hero who had dedicated his life to defending Iran’s interests and fighting against terrorism. His death, therefore, was seen as a massive loss not only for Iran but for the wider region.
The funeral procession began in Tehran, where Suleimani’s body was taken to the Masjid al-Jamkaran mosque for prayers. From there, the procession moved through the streets of Tehran, with mourners lining the roads and chanting slogans in support of Suleimani and against the United States.
The crowds were so large that the procession had to be extended multiple times to accommodate everyone who wanted to pay their respects. Many people had traveled from across the country to attend the funeral, with some even walking hundreds of kilometers to be there.
The funeral procession was not without its moments of tension, however. At one point, a stampede broke out as mourners jostled to get closer to the vehicle carrying Suleimani’s coffin. Several people were injured in the incident, although there were no reports of any fatalities.
The funeral also saw a show of force from Iran’s military, with Iranian officials vowing revenge for Suleimani’s death and warning the United States of the consequences of its actions. In a speech at the funeral, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for “harsh revenge” against the United States, while the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, declared that Iran would “take revenge on America, the Great Satan, in a place and at a time that we choose.”
The funeral procession eventually ended in Suleimani’s hometown of Kerman, where he was buried in a cemetery alongside other Iranian military figures. The crowds that had gathered for the funeral gradually dispersed, but the memory of Suleimani and the outpouring of grief that his death had sparked would continue to resonate in Iran and beyond for years to come.
The funeral of Qasem Suleimani was a somber and emotional event, but it also served as a powerful reminder of the deep divisions and tensions that exist between Iran and the United States, and the potential for further conflict in the region. As the world watched Iran mourn the loss of one of its most revered military figures, many wondered what the future held for this volatile and unpredictable part of the world.
