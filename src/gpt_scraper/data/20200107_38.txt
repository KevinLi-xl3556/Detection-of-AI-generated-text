The opening session of Venezuela’s National Assembly on Monday was marked by chaos, scuffles, tear gas, and doused lights. The country has been in turmoil for several years now, with political and economic crises reaching a boiling point. The assembly’s meeting was an attempt to bring some semblance of normalcy to the country’s politics, but it was a far cry from that.
The National Assembly, which is controlled by opposition lawmakers, was holding its first session since the government of President Nicolas Maduro lost control of the legislature in December’s elections. The opposition’s Juan Guaido was elected as the new assembly speaker, but the government has refused to recognize him.
The session began with a heated dispute over the credentials of several lawmakers, with pro-Maduro legislators refusing to recognize the credentials of Guaido and several other opposition lawmakers. The argument quickly turned into a scuffle, with lawmakers from both sides exchanging blows and pushing each other.
The situation worsened when the lights in the chamber were suddenly turned off, plunging the room into darkness. This was followed by the deployment of tear gas, which left several lawmakers and journalists gasping for breath.
Guaido, who was eventually recognized as the assembly speaker, condemned the actions of the pro-Maduro lawmakers, calling them an “attack on democracy.” He vowed to continue working towards restoring democracy in Venezuela, despite the government’s attempts to undermine him and his colleagues.
The incident at the National Assembly is the latest in a long line of political and economic crises in Venezuela. The country has been plagued by hyperinflation, shortages of food and medicine, and political repression, which have forced millions of Venezuelans to flee the country.
The government of President Maduro has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings, and the international community has imposed economic sanctions on the country in an attempt to force the government to change its ways.
The opening of the National Assembly was meant to be a step towards a brighter future for Venezuela, but it only served to highlight the deep divisions within the country’s political class. As the situation continues to deteriorate, the international community must remain vigilant in its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Venezuela.
