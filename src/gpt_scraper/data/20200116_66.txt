Leslie Jones, the American comedian and actress, is no stranger to controversy or pushing boundaries. She rose to fame as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, where she became known for her outspoken and raunchy humor. Away from the stage, Jones continues to be a force for change, unapologetically speaking out on issues of race, gender, and sexuality.
Recently, Jones has taken her activism to the next level. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she spoke candidly about her experiences in Hollywood and her determination to shake things up. “I’m at the point in my career where I don’t have to play by the rules anymore,” she said. “I don’t have to be what people expect me to be. I can be whoever I want to be.”
Jones has already made waves in Hollywood. In 2019, she starred in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, which faced intense backlash from fans of the original film. Despite the criticism, Jones remained unflinching in her support of the project. “I’m a Ghostbuster. It’s official,” she tweeted at the time. “I’m in, and it’s gonna be crazy!”
Jones has also been vocal about the lack of diversity in Hollywood. In 2017, she called out designers who refused to dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters because of her size. “It’s so funny how there are no designers wanting to help me with a premiere dress for movie,” she tweeted. “Hmmm that will change and I remember everything.”
More recently, Jones has been using her platform to speak out against police brutality and racial injustice. She has attended protests and used her social media to amplify Black voices and promote activism. “I’m not gonna be quiet anymore,” she told Rolling Stone. “I’m gonna speak up, and I’m gonna rock the boat, hard.”
For Jones, speaking out is a form of resistance. “I’m just tired of the s—,” she said. “I’m tired of feeling like I can’t say what I want to say. I’m tired of feeling like I have to be quiet because I might lose something. F— that. If you don’t like what I say, you can kiss my black ass.”
Jones’ boldness has made her a target for criticism and harassment. She has been subjected to racist and sexist abuse on social media, and has been open about the toll it has taken on her mental health. But despite the challenges, Jones remains defiant. “I’m not gonna let them win,” she said. “I’m gonna keep speaking out, and I’m gonna keep pushing for change. Because that’s what being a badass is all about.”
Leslie Jones is a force to be reckoned with. She refuses to be silenced or underestimated, and is determined to use her voice to fight for what she believes in. Whether she’s making you laugh or challenging your worldview, one thing is clear: Leslie Jones is here to rock the boat, hard.
