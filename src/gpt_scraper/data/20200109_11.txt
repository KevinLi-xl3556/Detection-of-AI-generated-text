Since taking office in 2017, former US President Donald Trump pursued a confrontational foreign policy towards Iran. This culminated in the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, and the imposition of sanctions that crippled Iran’s economy. Many have debated whether Trump’s approach was the right one for dealing with Iran’s nuclear program and broader geopolitical ambitions. In this article, we will explore both sides of the argument and attempt to answer the question: Did Trump do the right thing with Iran?
The argument for Trump’s approach
Those who support Trump’s approach towards Iran argue that his policies were necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to curb its destabilizing activities in the Middle East. They point out that Iran’s nuclear program had continued to advance despite the JCPOA, which had only temporarily halted its progress. Furthermore, Iran’s support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah and its interference in the affairs of neighboring countries like Iraq and Syria were seen as major threats to regional stability.
Trump’s supporters also point out that his maximum pressure campaign against Iran had worked in several ways. The sanctions imposed on Iran had severely impacted its economy, leading to widespread protests and social unrest. Additionally, the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in early 2020 had dealt a significant blow to Iran’s military capabilities and deterred further Iranian aggression.
The argument against Trump’s approach
Opponents of Trump’s approach argue that his policies were counterproductive and only served to further inflame tensions with Iran. They argue that the US withdrawal from the JCPOA was a mistake that only emboldened hardliners in Iran and pushed the country closer to developing nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the sanctions imposed on Iran had hurt ordinary Iranians more than the regime, causing widespread suffering and resentment towards the United States.
Critics of Trump’s approach also point out that it had failed to achieve its stated objectives. Despite the maximum pressure campaign, Iran had continued to pursue its nuclear program and had increased its regional influence through proxy groups like Hezbollah. Furthermore, the killing of General Soleimani had not deterred further Iranian aggression, as evidenced by Iran’s attacks on US military bases in Iraq in the aftermath of the strike.
Conclusion
So, did Trump do the right thing with Iran? The answer is not a simple one. While his confrontational approach may have succeeded in some areas, such as weakening Iran’s economy and military capabilities, it also had significant drawbacks. The US withdrawal from the JCPOA and the imposition of sanctions had hurt ordinary Iranians and failed to achieve their intended objectives. Moreover, it is unclear whether Trump’s policies have made the region any safer or brought Iran closer to abandoning its nuclear program.
Ultimately, the question of whether Trump did the right thing with Iran may be one that historians will debate for years to come. What is clear, however, is that the US relationship with Iran remains one of the most significant challenges facing US foreign policy today. It will be up to future administrations to decide how best to address this complex and multifaceted issue.
