‘Like a Boss’ Review: Tiffany & Rose’s Very Unfortunate Adventure
Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne star in the latest comedy ‘Like a Boss’ in which the duo attempts to tackle the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. While the premise seems promising, the execution of the script ultimately falls short.
The film introduces Mia (Haddish) and Mel (Byrne) as lifelong best friends who own a beauty company but struggle to make ends meet. Enter industry titan Claire Luna (Salma Hayek) who offers to invest in their startup, but with one catch - she wants control of the company. Despite some initial apprehension, Mia and Mel ultimately decide to give in to Luna’s demands, leading to a series of comical events that put their friendship and business at risk.
‘Like a Boss’ does have moments of genuine humor, largely credited to Haddish’s comedic delivery. However, the humor is often overshadowed by a weak plotline and predictable jokes. The movie attempts to include themes of female empowerment, but falls into tired cliches rather than creating anything new or poignant.
It’s evident that Haddish and Byrne have a natural rapport, but their talents aren’t fully utilized in this film. Throughout the movie, the script fails to explore the complex friendship between the two, choosing instead to rely on juvenile humor and tired plot devices.
Hayek, while a talented actress, doesn’t have much to work with in this role. Luna is a one-dimensional character whose every action is predictable and ultimately unsatisfying.
The film also struggles to find its rhythm, with some scenes dragging on for too long while others skip over potentially interesting plot points.
Overall, ‘Like a Boss’ is a forgettable comedy that never quite finds its footing. While the leads have their moments, the film’s underlying problems with plot and pacing ultimately downfall any potential for success.
