Iran’s President Calls for Special Court on Downed Plane
In January 2020, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by the Iranian military shortly after taking off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. The incident sparked international outrage and calls for accountability from the Iranian government. Now, more than a year later, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has called for a special court to be established to investigate the tragedy and hold those responsible accountable.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, President Rouhani announced that he had signed a bill into law to create a special court to handle the case. The court will be headed by a senior judge and will include representatives from the judiciary, the military, and the aviation industry. President Rouhani stated that the court’s purpose would be to “investigate all aspects of the case, identify the individuals responsible, and hold them accountable in a fair and transparent manner.”
The creation of the special court is a significant development in the aftermath of the downing of Flight 752. The incident had initially been attributed to technical problems with the plane, but it was later revealed that it had been shot down by the Iranian military. Iran initially denied responsibility for the tragedy, but later acknowledged that it had been a mistake caused by “human error.”
The incident has strained relations between Iran and Canada, as many of the passengers on Flight 752 were Canadian citizens or residents. Canadian officials have been calling for a thorough investigation and justice for the victims and their families. In response to President Rouhani’s announcement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that Canada would continue to push for accountability and justice for the victims.
The creation of the special court is a positive step towards accountability, but many questions remain about how the investigation will be conducted and who will be held responsible. Some have raised concerns that the court will not be independent and that the Iranian government will use it as a tool to deflect blame and protect high-ranking officials.
The families of the victims have also expressed skepticism about the court, stating that they do not trust the Iranian government to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. Many have called for an international investigation to be conducted by an independent body.
The downing of Flight 752 was a tragedy that shook the world and left many families grieving for loved ones. While the creation of a special court is a positive step, it remains to be seen whether justice will be served and those responsible held accountable. The international community will be watching closely to see how the investigation unfolds and whether it is conducted in a fair and transparent manner.
