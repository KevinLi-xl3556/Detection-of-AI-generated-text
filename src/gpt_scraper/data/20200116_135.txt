The Campaign to Redefine ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’
For decades, people have been using the term ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’ to describe a phenomenon where individuals experience symptoms like headaches, sweating, and nausea after eating Chinese food. The term is derogatory and misleading, suggesting that the cuisine is the root cause of the symptoms. This stereotype has resulted in feelings of discrimination towards Chinese cuisine, along with the Chinese community as a whole. However, after years of protests and raised awareness, there is an ongoing campaign to redefine the term.
The term ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’ was first used in a 1968 article in the New England Journal of Medicine. The author, Dr. Robert Ho Man Kwok, described experiencing symptoms after eating at Chinese restaurants in America. While Kwok’s article did not say that Chinese food caused his symptoms, and his reference to Chinese restaurants was merely intended to describe where he ate when feeling ill, the term took on a life of its own, and people began to associate Chinese food with illness.
Over time, the term ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’ became deeply ingrained in society’s mindset, and even today, it continues to be used. The prevalence of the term suggests that many people still believe that Chinese food causes adverse reactions. However, there is evidence to suggest that other factors, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), may be responsible for the symptoms some people experience after eating Chinese food.
The Campaign to Redefine ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’ aims to raise awareness about the derogatory nature of the term and promote more accurate descriptions of the symptoms people experience. Those involved in the campaign are calling for medical professionals to use more objective language, so patients can receive appropriate treatment. In addition, the campaign seeks to elevate the reputation of Chinese cuisine, which has long been vilified in the Western world.
One of the most challenging aspects of the campaign is overcoming the misinformation that surrounds the connection between Chinese food and adverse reactions. While MSG has been implicated as a possible culprit, most scientific studies have failed to establish a direct link between its consumption and negative symptoms. Nevertheless, the term has taken root, and it will take time and effort to change people’s minds about Chinese food and eliminate the negative stereotypes associated with it.
The Campaign to Redefine ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’ is a significant step towards promoting greater cultural understanding and appreciation. By moving away from stereotypes and towards more accurate descriptions of symptoms, we can build a more respectful society where Chinese cuisine is valued and respected. Ultimately, the hope is that initiatives like these will help to build bridges between different cultures and foster greater levels of acceptance and inclusivity.
