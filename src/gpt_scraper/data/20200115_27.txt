After months of negotiations, the United States and China recently announced a partial trade deal that has brought some relief to the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries. The deal, which was signed in January 2020, has been touted as a significant step forward in the U.S.-China trade relationship. However, there is still a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly is in (and not in) the U.S.-China trade deal.
Here is a breakdown of what you need to know about the U.S.-China trade deal:
What’s in the U.S.-China trade deal?
Under the agreement, China has agreed to increase its purchases of U.S. goods and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years. This includes a commitment to buy $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products, such as soybeans and pork, as well as energy products, manufactured goods, and services.
In addition to the increased purchases, the U.S. has suspended an additional $160 billion in tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on Chinese goods such as smartphones, laptops, and toys. The U.S. has also reduced the tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese goods from 15% to 7.5%.
The U.S.-China trade deal also includes provisions on intellectual property protection, currency manipulation, and forced transfer of technology. Under the agreement, China has committed to taking measures to protect U.S. intellectual property and to not engage in currency manipulation to gain an unfair advantage in international trade. The deal also includes enforcement mechanisms to ensure China is following through on its commitments.
What’s not in the U.S.-China trade deal?
One of the main criticisms of the U.S.-China trade deal is that it is only a partial agreement and does not address all of the issues that led to the trade war between the two countries. For example, the agreement does not include provisions on China’s subsidies to state-owned enterprises, which has been a key concern for the U.S.
The U.S.-China trade deal also does not address the broader geopolitical issues between the two countries, such as China’s growing influence in the world and its human rights abuses. Critics argue that by focusing solely on economic issues, the U.S. is ignoring other important issues that are critical to its relationship with China.
What’s next for the U.S.-China trade relationship?
While the U.S.-China trade deal is a positive development in the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future of the U.S.-China trade relationship. The U.S. has stated that it will continue to monitor China’s compliance with the agreement, and there is a possibility that additional tariffs could be imposed if China fails to meet its commitments.
In addition, the U.S. has said that a second phase of negotiations with China will begin soon, although it is unclear what issues will be addressed in this second phase. It is also possible that the U.S.-China trade deal could be derailed by other geopolitical issues, such as tensions over Taiwan or the South China Sea.
Overall, the U.S.-China trade deal represents a significant step forward in the trade relationship between the two countries. However, it is important to remember that it is only a partial agreement and does not address all of the issues that led to the trade war. As such, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future of the U.S.-China trade relationship.
