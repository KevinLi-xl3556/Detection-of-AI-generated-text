In recent years, the rise of populism has shaken the political landscape in many countries around the world. Promising to represent the common people against the political and economic elites, populist movements have gained support from a wide range of voters. However, in some cases, populism has failed to win over certain segments of the electorate who prioritize identity politics over economic issues.
Identity politics refers to political activism or engagement that is primarily motivated by an individual’s membership in a particular social group, such as race, gender, sexuality, or religion. It often involves advocating for the rights and interests of one’s group, and challenging the power structures that marginalize or oppress them.
While populism and identity politics are often seen as opposing forces, they can also intersect and overlap in complex ways. For example, some populist movements may appeal to a sense of national identity or cultural heritage, which can overlap with issues of race, ethnicity, or religion. Similarly, some identity politics movements may adopt populist rhetoric or tactics to challenge the status quo and gain political power.
However, when populism and identity politics come into conflict, it can create a difficult dilemma for voters. On the one hand, populist movements may promise to address economic inequality, corruption, and other issues that affect many people regardless of their identity. On the other hand, identity politics movements may prioritize issues that are more directly related to their group’s experiences of discrimination, such as police brutality, reproductive rights, or access to healthcare.
In some cases, voters may be forced to choose between these competing priorities, which can lead to polarization and division within communities. For example, in the 2016 US presidential election, many working-class voters in rural areas supported Donald Trump, who promised to bring back manufacturing jobs and revive the economy. However, many minority voters, especially Black and Latino voters, were turned off by Trump’s rhetoric on immigration, race, and Islamophobia, which they saw as a threat to their identity and well-being.
Similarly, in the UK’s Brexit referendum in 2016, many voters in disadvantaged areas supported leaving the EU, which they saw as a way to take back control from the distant, unaccountable elites in Brussels. However, many young, urban voters and ethnic minorities opposed Brexit, which they saw as a manifestation of xenophobia, nationalism, and intolerance.
So, when populism can’t beat identity politics, what happens? In some cases, it can lead to a stalemate, where neither side is able to gain a decisive advantage. This can result in a fragmented, polarized political landscape, where different groups have competing interests and little incentive to cooperate or compromise.
However, in other cases, it can lead to a backlash against populism, as voters become disillusioned with the promises and rhetoric of populist leaders. This can create an opening for identity politics movements, which may be better able to mobilize their base and build coalitions across different groups.
For example, in the 2020 US presidential election, Joe Biden was able to defeat Donald Trump by appealing to a broad coalition of voters, including young people, women, people of color, and working-class Americans. Biden’s campaign focused on issues such as healthcare, climate change, and racial justice, which resonated with voters who saw these issues as essential to their identity and well-being.
In conclusion, while populism and identity politics are often seen as opposing forces, they can also intersect and overlap in complex ways. When they come into conflict, it can create a difficult dilemma for voters, who may be forced to choose between competing priorities. However, in some cases, the failure of populism to win over certain segments of the electorate can create an opening for identity politics movements, which may be better able to mobilize their base and build coalitions across different groups.
