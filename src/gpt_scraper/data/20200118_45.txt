The fourth Women’s March took place on January 18, 2020, in cities across the United States. Thousands of women and allies took to the streets to demand gender equality, reproductive rights, and an end to systemic sexism and racism. While the march received significant attention from the media and the public, it was not without its issues.
One of the main issues faced by organizers was a lack of cohesion and focus. Unlike previous Women’s Marches, the fourth march lacked a clear, unified message. Instead, the event seemed to be a collection of various causes and grievances, with participants holding signs and chanting slogans on a range of topics, from climate change to immigration.
Despite these challenges, organizers emphasized that the march was still a significant moment in the fight for gender equality. “Our message is still the same: we demand justice for all women, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity,” said Women’s March co-founder Tamika Mallory.
Another issue was the controversy surrounding the national organizers of the Women’s March organization. Several high-profile activists, including Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory, were criticized for their connections to Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who has a history of making anti-Semitic comments. The controversy caused several local Women’s March chapters to disaffiliate from the national organization, leading to a splintering of the movement.
Despite these controversies, participants and organizers emphasized that the Women’s March remains an important vehicle for activism and resistance. “The Women’s March is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got,” said one participant at the New York City march. “We won’t let internal disputes or external attacks silence us. We’re here to resist and persist.”
The Women’s March movement began in 2017, the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration as President of the United States. That first march drew millions of participants worldwide, making it one of the largest protests in U.S. history. Since then, the movement has continued to hold annual marches and rallies in cities around the world.
Despite the challenges faced by the Women’s March, the movement remains a vital force for progress and equality. As Tamika Mallory put it, “Our issues may be different, but it all ties into Trump. We’re fighting against a system that devalues women and marginalized communities – and that’s something we all need to stand up against.”
