In the tech world, leaked internal memos have become a sort of rite of passage for companies. Facebook, the social media giant, is no stranger to this phenomenon. Recently, an internal memo from Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s Vice President of Augmented and Virtual Reality, went viral on the internet. In this memo, Bosworth drew a comparison between the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the year 2020, and Stuffed Oreos. In this article, we’ll dive into Bosworth’s memo and what it means for Facebook.
The Memo
In the memo titled “The 2020 Memo”, Bosworth compared the year 2020 to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. He wrote, “Like Lord of the Rings, this year had three acts. Each one more challenging than the last.” Bosworth drew parallels between the year’s events and the events in the movies. For example, he likened the pandemic to the first act of the trilogy, where Frodo sets out on his journey to destroy the One Ring.
The memo takes a bizarre turn when Bosworth talks about Stuffed Oreos. He writes, “Stuffed Oreos are like augmented and virtual reality. Nobody needs them, but damn are they good.” He then goes on to say that augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) are the future and will play a significant role in the next act of the trilogy (i.e., the post-pandemic world).
What it Means for Facebook
Bosworth’s memo sheds light on Facebook’s plans for AR/VR. The company has been investing heavily in this technology, with the goal of creating an entirely new platform that merges the physical and digital worlds. The memo indicates that Facebook sees AR/VR as a crucial part of the post-pandemic world.
It’s worth noting that the memo was written in December 2020, before Facebook’s recent rebranding to Meta. The rebranding was a strategic move to focus on AR/VR and position the company as a leader in this space. In his memo, Bosworth hints at this rebranding, writing, “2021 is the year we move forward. The year we become Meta.”
The memo also highlights the importance of storytelling in AR/VR. Bosworth draws a comparison between the Lord of the Rings trilogy and AR/VR, saying, “We need to build our own Middle-earth. We need to create stories that transport people to new worlds and keep them there.” This idea aligns with Facebook’s recent announcement of Horizon Workrooms, a new VR platform for remote collaboration.
Conclusion
The leaked Andrew Bosworth memo provides a glimpse into Facebook’s plans for AR/VR and how the company sees this technology fitting into the post-pandemic world. Bosworth’s comparison between the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the year 2020, and Stuffed Oreos is certainly an unusual one, but it serves to highlight the potential of AR/VR and the importance of storytelling in this medium. As Facebook continues to invest in AR/VR and Meta, it will be interesting to see how the company’s plans unfold and what new worlds it creates for us to explore.
