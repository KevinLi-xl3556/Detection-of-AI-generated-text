Zegna’s Indian Ambitions: The Luxury Fashion Brand’s Entry Into the Growing Indian Market
Zegna, the Italian luxury fashion brand, has set its sights on India, a country with a growing appetite for luxury goods. With a population of over 1.3 billion people and a growing middle class, India is a market with great potential for luxury brands like Zegna.
The brand’s entry into India comes as no surprise, given the Indian luxury market’s growth rate of over 25% per year, according to a recent report by KPMG. With the country’s economy growing at a steady pace, more Indian consumers are willing to splurge on high-end fashion goods.
Zegna’s first entry into India was through its partnership with Reliance Brands, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. In 2017, the two companies formed a joint venture to bring the Zegna brand to India, with plans to open more than 20 stores in the country.
Since then, Zegna has opened several stores in key Indian cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. The brand’s stores in India offer a wide range of clothing, accessories and fragrances, catering to the tastes of the country’s elite.
Apart from its brick-and-mortar stores, Zegna has also entered the Indian e-commerce market through its official website and on online portals such as Myntra and Jabong. The brand’s move into e-commerce is a strategic one, given the increasing number of online shoppers in India.
Zegna has also taken steps to appeal to Indian consumers’ tastes by creating exclusive collections for the country. For instance, the brand’s “India-made” collection is crafted from fabrics sourced from India and tailored to the country’s unique sizing requirements.
Additionally, Zegna has also collaborated with Indian designers such as Suket Dhir and Rajesh Pratap Singh, to create special collections that combine the brand’s Italian craftsmanship with Indian aesthetic sensibilities.
Zegna’s entry into India is part of a larger trend of luxury brands seeking to tap into the country’s growing market. Other brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Hermes have also expanded their presence in India in recent years.
India’s luxury market may still be in its infancy compared to markets such as China, but the country’s potential for growth cannot be overlooked. With companies like Zegna and Reliance Brands leading the way, India’s luxury market is set to blossom in the coming years.
