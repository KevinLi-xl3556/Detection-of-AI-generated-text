The San Francisco 49ers’ 2019 season was a remarkable one, culminating in a trip to the Super Bowl against the Kansas City Chiefs. But what many people may not know is that a piece of advice from a rival team may have played a crucial role in launching the 49ers on their path to glory.
During the off-season prior to the 2019 campaign, the 49ers were a team with a lot of potential but still had several question marks. One of the biggest areas of concern was at the linebacker position, where the team lacked depth and experience.
It was during this time that 49ers executive and former NFL linebacker, John Lynch, had a chance encounter with former Seattle Seahawks linebacker, Brian Banks. Banks, who had been wrongfully convicted of a crime and spent several years in prison before being exonerated, had been hired by the NFL as a front office intern.
Lynch took the opportunity to pick Banks’ brain about defense, specifically at the linebacker position. The 49ers executive was looking for advice on what qualities to look for in a linebacker and how to evaluate talent at the position.
Banks, who had played linebacker at a high level in college and the NFL, shared his insights with Lynch. One key piece of advice he gave was to look for players who had a high football IQ and were able to read and react quickly on the field.
Armed with this new perspective, the 49ers set out to draft and sign players who fit this mold. They picked up linebacker Kwon Alexander in free agency and drafted linebacker Dre Greenlaw in the fifth round of the 2019 NFL Draft.
Both players exceeded expectations and became integral parts of the 49ers’ defense. Alexander provided veteran leadership and playmaking ability, while Greenlaw played with a relentless energy and became a fan favorite.
The new linebackers were able to mesh seamlessly with the rest of the defense, which was already loaded with talent. They helped the team to finish the regular season with a 13-3 record and earn the top seed in the NFC playoffs.
In the playoffs, the 49ers’ defense was dominant, allowing just 30 points across three games. They shut down the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers, holding each team to single digit points, to advance to the Super Bowl.
Although the 49ers came up short in the big game against the Chiefs, there’s no denying that the advice from a former rival played a crucial role in getting them there. Banks’ insights into linebacker play helped the team to identify and acquire the right talent to bolster their defense and make a run at the Super Bowl.
The story of the 49ers’ 2019 season is a testament to the power of collaboration and learning from others, even if they are your rivals. By being open to new ideas and perspectives, the team was able to overcome their weaknesses and achieve greatness.
