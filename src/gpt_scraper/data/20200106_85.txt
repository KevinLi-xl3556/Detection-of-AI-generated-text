In Virginia, Democrats are feeling the heat as they work overtime to make their mark in legislation now that they have the majority in the General Assembly.
Since the November 2019 elections, Democrats have held the majority in both the House of Delegates and State Senate, thus leading to increased opportunities for them to push their agenda through.
The first few weeks of the legislative session have been busy for Democrats as they roll out a slew of new laws and regulations focusing on a variety of issues. Some of the bills already passed include laws related to gun safety, raising the minimum wage, and making Election Day a state holiday.
One significant effort is ensuring every Virginian has access to affordable, quality healthcare. The Governor Ralph Northam-led administration has made this a top priority, with Democrats working to expand Medicaid coverage and slash prescription drug costs, among other things.
Another major priority is improving Virginia’s education system. As part of their initiative, Democrats are planning to increase funding for public schools and boost teacher pay as they work to make the education system more equitable.
The environment is also a focus on this year’s agenda. Virginia is taking a leading role in combating climate change, with several bills aimed at addressing pollution and promoting renewable energy sources.
The push towards social justice reform is yet another area of focus. Democratic lawmakers are addressing the need for criminal justice reform and have already passed laws to abolish the death penalty and restore voting rights for former felons.
These efforts by Democrats are faced with significant roadblocks; Republicans lawmakers, who make up nearly half the members in the General Assembly, have continually expressed their concern with the Democrats’ legislation. For example, many Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage or expanding Medicaid, arguing that such actions could have negative economic consequences.
Despite these challenges, Democrats are determined to push ahead with their agenda, citing the strong mandate from voters in last year’s election. They believe there is broad popular support for their policies that serve to benefit the people of Virginia.
As the Virginia legislative session continues, Democrats are likely to face an uphill battle as they work to pass their bills into laws. However, they are committed to seeing through their plans, and as the newly dominant force in Virginia’s General Assembly, they are set to make impactful changes for the state’s residents.
