At the upcoming Grammy Awards, one of the most hotly contested categories is always “Best New Artist." This year, one of the nominees is Yola, a British singer-songwriter who has been hailed as a rising star in the industry. However, what many people don’t realize is that Yola’s overnight success has actually been years in the making, with over 20 years of experience in the music industry.
Yola’s journey began in Bristol, England, where she grew up in poverty and abuse. Despite the challenges she faced, music provided a refuge and a source of comfort for her. At the age of 16, she joined a band and began performing in local pubs and clubs. Over the next decade, she would go on to front a number of bands and work as a session singer for artists like Massive Attack and Bugz in the Attic.
However, it wasn’t until 2016 that Yola got her big break, when she was invited to sing backup for country-soul artist Sturgill Simpson at the Americana Music Awards. This led to her meeting Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who produced her debut album, “Walk Through Fire.” The album was released in 2019 and was met with critical acclaim, earning Yola her first Grammy nomination for Best Americana Album.
What’s striking about Yola’s story is the amount of experience she had accumulated before finally getting her shot at stardom. She has spoken openly about the challenges she faced as a Black woman in the music industry, including being told by industry insiders that her music was “too Black” or “not Black enough.” However, she persevered and continued to hone her craft, even when success seemed out of reach.
Yola’s music is a fusion of genres, combining elements of soul, country, and rock. Her powerful voice is often compared to that of Tina Turner or Aretha Franklin, and her lyrics touch on themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her music is not only a testament to her own talent but also a celebration of the diverse musical traditions that have influenced her.
As Yola prepares to attend her first Grammy Awards ceremony, she is a reminder that success in the music industry is not just about talent but also about perseverance and hard work. Her journey serves as an inspiration to young artists who may be facing their own challenges and setbacks. And for those who have been lucky enough to discover Yola’s music, they know that her nomination for Best New Artist is well deserved, and that she is a force to be reckoned with in the world of music.
