The New York Mets announced on Thursday that Luis Rojas will be taking over as manager for the upcoming 2020 season, replacing Carlos Beltran who was ousted from the position earlier this week.
Rojas, who was previously the quality control coach for the Mets, was considered a top candidate for the managerial position despite not having any major league managerial experience. However, Rojas has been in the Mets organization for over a decade, serving as a minor league manager since 2011.
As the son of former major league player and manager Felipe Alou, Rojas has baseball in his blood and a deep understanding of the game. He has been praised for his leadership qualities and his ability to communicate effectively with players.
Mets COO Jeff Wilpon said in a statement, “We are excited to name Luis Rojas as the manager of the New York Mets. Luis is a talented communicator, and his leadership qualities, coupled with his ability to develop talent, make him the ideal person to lead our club.”
Rojas will be taking over the managerial job just weeks before the start of Spring Training, but he’s no stranger to the big stage. He managed the Dominican Republic in the 2019 Pan American Games, leading the team to a silver medal.
This decision comes after a tumultuous off-season for the Mets, with the Beltran scandal being just one of the many issues the team has faced. The Mets have also been embroiled in a legal battle with former manager Mickey Callaway after an investigation into his behavior towards female reporters.
But amidst all the drama, the Mets are still focused on the upcoming season and are hopeful that Rojas is the right man for the job.
Rojas is excited to have the opportunity to lead the Mets, saying, “I’m excited for the opportunity to lead this team. The Mets have a great group of players, and I look forward to helping them achieve their goals both on and off the field.”
While many are still reeling from the Beltran scandal, Mets fans are hoping that Rojas can be the one to turn things around for the team. With a fresh face at the helm and a talented roster, the Mets are looking towards a promising future under Luis Rojas.
