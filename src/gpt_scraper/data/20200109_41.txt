Bill Cosby, the former sitcom star and comedian, has filed an appeal in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, citing a #MeToo bias against him. Cosby was found guilty in 2018 of sexual assault, and has been serving a three-to-ten-year prison sentence since then.
In the appeal, Cosby’s lawyers argue that he was denied a fair trial due to the #MeToo movement, which they claim led to the media and the public presuming his guilt. Cosby’s lawyers also allege that the trial judge in his case, Steven T. O’Neill, allowed testimony from other accusers, which they claim unfairly prejudiced the jury.
Cosby’s case has been a lightning rod for controversy, as his accusers have accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting them. The allegations first came to light in 2014, and sparked a nationwide conversation about sexual harassment and assault.
Cosby’s appeal argues that the judge should have kept other accusers from testifying, arguing that their testimony was prejudicial and had nothing to do with the charges against Cosby. They also argue that the judge should have granted a request to move the trial out of Montgomery County, where Cosby has many ties, due to the pretrial publicity.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will have to decide whether to hear Cosby’s appeal. If they choose to hear the case, they could potentially overturn his conviction and order a new trial.
The #MeToo movement has been credited with bringing conversations about sexual harassment and assault to the forefront, but has also been accused of going too far in some cases. Cosby’s lawyers argue that the movement has led to a presumption of guilt for accused men, and that Cosby is the victim of such bias.
The case has garnered a lot of attention from the media and the public, with many arguing that Cosby’s conviction was long overdue. However, his appeal is likely to bring the case back to the forefront once again, and could lead to a new trial and eventual release for the comedian.
In the end, only time will tell how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will rule on Cosby’s appeal. But regardless of the outcome, his case has sparked important discussions about sexual harassment and assault, and has highlighted the impact of the #MeToo movement on the legal system.
