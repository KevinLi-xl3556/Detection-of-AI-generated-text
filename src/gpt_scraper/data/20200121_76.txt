In recent years, Bollywood has been making waves on the global stage, with Indian films and stars gaining popularity and recognition outside of their home country. However, one Bollywood star has taken on a challenge that is not limited to the film industry - breaking down global stigmas.
Deepika Padukone is one of Bollywood’s biggest stars, known for her beauty, charisma, and acting skills. In 2017, she chose to use her platform to speak out about her own struggles with depression. In doing so, she broke a major taboo in India, where mental health issues are often stigmatized and ignored.
Her admission not only sparked a national conversation about mental health, but it also inspired others around the world to speak up about their own struggles. Deepika has since become an advocate for mental health awareness and has launched her own foundation, the Live Love Laugh Foundation, to provide support, awareness, and treatment for people struggling with mental health issues.
But Deepika’s advocacy doesn’t stop there. She has also taken on another global stigma - the taboo around menstruation. In 2019, she produced and starred in the film “Chhapaak,” which tells the true story of an acid attack survivor. The film not only sheds light on the horrific act of acid attacks but also touches on the discrimination and stigma faced by survivors, particularly in regards to their menstrual cycles.
In India, many women who have been disfigured by acid attacks are not only ostracized by their communities but are also denied basic menstrual hygiene products and education. The film, along with Deepika’s advocacy, has helped to raise awareness about this issue and encourage positive change.
Deepika’s willingness to take on these global stigmas is a reminder of the power of celebrities to effect change. By using their platforms to advocate for important social causes, they can help to shift perceptions, break taboos, and make a positive impact on the world.
It’s imperative that more celebrities take a page out of Deepika’s book and use their influence to bring attention to important issues, particularly those that are often stigmatized or ignored. Only then can we hope to make meaningful progress towards a more just and equitable world.
