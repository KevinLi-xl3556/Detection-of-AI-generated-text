Russia, Iran, McDonald’s: Your Thursday Briefing
Good morning! Here are some of the top international news stories to start your day.
Russia:
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will be running for re-election in 2024, extending his rule over the country for another six years. This move comes after Putin pushed through constitutional changes last year that would allow him to bypass term limits and stay in power until at least 2036. Some experts believe that this move could lead to an increase in political repression and a further erosion of civil liberties in Russia.
Iran:
Iran’s presidential election is set to take place on Friday, with hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi expected to win. Raisi is widely seen as a favored candidate of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his victory would likely signal a more confrontational approach to the West. The election comes amid ongoing negotiations between Iran and the United States over a potential revival of the 2015 nuclear deal.
McDonald’s:
Fast food giant McDonald’s has announced that it will be launching its BTS meal in 11 new markets, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia. The BTS meal, which features a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, special sauces, and medium fries, has already been a hit in countries like the United States, Canada, and Singapore. The move is part of McDonald’s strategy to tap into popular culture and attract younger customers.
That’s all for today’s briefing. Have a great day!
