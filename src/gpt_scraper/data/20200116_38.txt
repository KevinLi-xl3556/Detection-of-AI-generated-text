In the modern NFL, the pass-happy offense has become the norm. The vast majority of teams have shifted their focus towards throwing the ball more often, utilizing spread formations and spreading defenses out to create passing opportunities. However, there is one team that has bucked that trend and found success by running the ball more than any other team in the league – the Tennessee Titans.
At the heart of this run-heavy approach is running back Derrick Henry, who has been the driving force behind the Titans’ success on the ground. Henry is a true physical specimen – a 6’3”, 250-pound bulldozer who is built to steamroll his way through defenders. He is arguably the most dominant runner in the league, and he is a nightmare for opposing defenses to try and stop.
So far this season, Henry has been on an absolute tear. He is currently leading the league in rushing yards with 1,532 yards and has scored 16 touchdowns on the ground. His remarkable consistency has helped the Titans establish themselves as one of the most elite rushing offenses in the league, and they are currently ranked third in total rushing yards.
But Henry’s dominance is not limited to just this season. He has been a force to be reckoned with ever since he entered the league four years ago. In that span, he has rushed for over 5,000 yards and has been named to two Pro Bowls.
Despite his individual success, however, Henry is quick to credit his teammates for his achievements. In particular, he has praised the Titans’ offensive line for their outstanding work in paving the way for him. The Titans’ line is one of the most physical units in the league, and they have done an outstanding job of opening up running lanes for Henry to exploit.
It’s not just the offensive line that deserves credit, though. Henry has also praised his quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, for his ability to make plays in the passing game. The threat of the Titans’ passing attack has helped to keep opposing defenses honest and has created more opportunities for Henry to run the ball.
Ultimately, the Titans’ run-heavy approach has paid off in a big way. They are currently 10-4 and are well-positioned to make a deep run in the playoffs. With Henry leading the charge on the ground, the Titans are a team that no one wants to face.
In a league that has become increasingly focused on passing, the Titans’ run-more rebellion has been a breath of fresh air. And with Derrick Henry at the forefront, they have become one of the most exciting teams in the league to watch.
