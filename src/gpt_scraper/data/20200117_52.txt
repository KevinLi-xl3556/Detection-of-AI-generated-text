In light of the recent outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, the United States has taken measures to prevent its spread within its borders. Three U.S. airports have been designated to screen passengers coming from China for the deadly virus. These airports are John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York, San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in California, and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in California.
The decision to screen passengers at airports follows reports of confirmed cases of the virus in several countries besides China, including the United States, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and the U.S. Government has updated its Travel Advisory for China to Level 4: Do Not Travel.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have deployed teams to these three airports, which are major entry points for travelers from China, to screen passengers for symptoms of the virus. The screening process involves a questionnaire and a temperature check. Those who show symptoms, such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, will be referred for further testing and evaluation.
The CDC has also issued guidance for healthcare providers on the evaluation of patients with potential 2019-nCoV infection. The guidance includes information on patient evaluation, specimen collection, testing, and infection control measures.
While the risk of contracting the virus in the United States remains low, the measures being taken are critical in preventing its spread. The CDC advises travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China, and those who have been in China within the past 14 days should monitor their health for symptoms.
The U.S. Government is working closely with the Chinese Government and other international partners to contain the outbreak and stop its spread. U.S. Government agencies are providing technical and financial assistance to support the global response to the outbreak, including funding for the WHOâ€™s efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.
In addition to the measures being taken at airports, it is essential that individuals take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. These include washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow, and staying home when sick.
The spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus is a serious concern, and the measures being taken by the U.S. Government are critical in preventing its further spread. By working together and taking appropriate precautions, we can help protect ourselves and our communities from this deadly virus.
