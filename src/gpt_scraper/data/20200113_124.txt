Drinking Tea Tied to Better Heart Health
Tea has been a staple in many cultures for centuries, and it’s no wonder. Not only is tea delicious, but it has been found to have many health benefits as well. One benefit in particular is its ability to promote heart health.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of tea on heart health, and the results are remarkable. One study found that people who drank at least three cups of tea per day had a 20% lower risk of heart disease than those who didn’t drink tea at all. Another study found that drinking green tea was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.
So, what is it about tea that makes it so good for the heart? The answer lies in the antioxidants found in tea. Antioxidants are molecules that help to prevent damage to cells and tissues caused by free radicals, which can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease.
Tea, particularly green tea, is packed with antioxidants called catechins. These catechins have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, improve blood vessel function, and lower blood pressure - all risk factors for heart disease.
Another benefit of tea for heart health is its ability to reduce inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been linked to the development of heart disease, and tea has been found to have anti-inflammatory properties. This is due in part to the polyphenols found in tea, which help to reduce inflammation throughout the body.
It’s important to note that not all teas are created equal when it comes to heart health benefits. While black tea and oolong tea do contain antioxidants, they don’t have as many as green tea. In addition, herbal teas don’t contain the same antioxidants as true tea (black, green, oolong) since they are made from a different plant.
In summary, drinking tea, particularly green tea, has been found to have many heart health benefits. Its high levels of antioxidants, particularly catechins, along with its ability to reduce inflammation make it a great addition to a heart-healthy diet. So, the next time you reach for a warm drink, consider brewing up a cup of tea for the added benefit of promoting heart health.
