Welcome to your weekend briefing, where we cover some of the top news stories from the past week. This week, we’ll be discussing Iran, impeachment, and the N.F.L. playoffs.
Iran:
Tensions have been high between the United States and Iran for years now, but the past week has seen a major escalation. On Tuesday, Iran fired missiles at two military bases in Iraq that housed U.S. troops. The attack was in retaliation for the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike earlier this month.
In the aftermath of the attack, President Trump announced that no U.S. troops had been injured and that he would not be escalating the conflict further. However, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the missile strike a “slap in the face” for the United States and vowed that Iran would continue to resist U.S. aggression.
Impeachment:
The impeachment trial of President Trump is set to begin next week, with opening arguments scheduled for Tuesday. The trial will determine whether the president should be removed from office for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.
The outcome of the trial is far from certain, as Republicans hold a majority in the Senate and have been largely supportive of the president. However, Democrats are hoping to sway public opinion and put pressure on moderate Republicans to vote in favor of impeachment.
N.F.L. Playoffs:
The N.F.L. playoffs are in full swing, with the divisional round games set to take place this weekend. The San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens, Kansas City Chiefs, and Green Bay Packers are the top seeds in their respective conferences and will be looking to advance to the conference championships.
One of the most anticipated games of the weekend is the matchup between the Ravens and the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens finished the regular season with a league-best 14-2 record, while the Titans are coming off a stunning upset victory over the New England Patriots in the wild card round.
In conclusion, this weekend is set to be a busy one, with tensions between the U.S. and Iran continuing to escalate, the impeachment trial of President Trump set to begin, and the N.F.L. playoffs in full swing. Stay tuned for updates on these and other stories as they develop.
