For Shrinking Cities, an Aggressive Way to Dodge the Census Bullet
The United States Census Bureau conducts a census every 10 years, and for many cities, this means facing some hard truths about their population. Shrinking cities - those whose population has declined by at least 10% over the past few decades - can feel the sting of the census more than most. A declining population can mean a loss of federal funding, fewer resources for schools and hospitals, and even a loss of political power. But some shrinking cities are taking an aggressive approach to the census, in an attempt to dodge the bullet of declining population.
One such city is Gary, Indiana. Once a thriving steel town, Gary has seen its population plummet from over 175,000 in the 1960s to just over 70,000 today. This decline has had a profound impact on the city’s economy, infrastructure, and social fabric. But rather than accept this fate, the city’s leaders are taking matters into their own hands. They have launched an aggressive campaign to get as many people as possible to fill out their census forms. From door-to-door canvassing to public events, Gary’s leaders are making sure that everyone in the city is counted.
Other shrinking cities are taking similar approaches. In Cleveland, for example, community organizations are partnering with the city government to create a “Census Bus.” This bus will travel around the city, stopping at community centers, senior centers, and other gathering places to provide information about the census and help people fill out their forms. Other cities are using social media to reach out to residents, creating Facebook pages and Twitter accounts dedicated to the census.
Why is the census so important for shrinking cities? First and foremost, it determines the amount of federal funding that cities receive. This funding is critical for things like transportation infrastructure, education, and healthcare. If a city’s population is undercounted, it can miss out on millions of dollars in federal funding. In addition, census data is used to determine political representation at the federal, state, and local levels. A undercounted population can mean fewer seats in Congress or in state legislatures, as well as less influence in local government.
But the census isn’t just about money and power. It’s also about community. For a city like Gary, the census is a chance to demonstrate that the city is still alive and kicking. It’s a chance to show that even though the population has declined, there are still people living, working, and thriving in the city. By making sure that every resident is counted, cities can create a more accurate picture of their population and their needs.
Of course, there are challenges to conducting an aggressive census campaign. Finding the resources to launch a citywide effort can be difficult, particularly for cities that are struggling financially. And convincing people to fill out their forms is no easy task. Many people are suspicious of government surveys, or are simply too busy or disinterested to participate.
But for shrinking cities, the benefits of a successful census campaign can be immense. By making sure that every resident is counted, these cities can secure the funding, political representation, and community recognition that they need to thrive. And in a country where cities are the engines of economic growth and cultural innovation, ensuring that every city is counted is more important than ever.
