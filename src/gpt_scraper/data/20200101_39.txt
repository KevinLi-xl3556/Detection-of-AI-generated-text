Reading ‘Us’ Through Its T-shirts
Jordan Peele’s 2019 horror-thriller movie ‘Us’ captivated audiences with its clever twists and turns, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. The film was a masterful exploration of duality, identity, and societal issues, all wrapped up in a chilling horror package. While there are many elements of the movie that contributed to its success, one often overlooked detail is the use of T-shirts as a storytelling device.
Throughout ‘Us,’ the characters wear a variety of T-shirts that, upon closer inspection, reveal deeper meanings about the story and its themes. These T-shirts, while seemingly innocuous at first, become an essential part of the movie’s narrative.
One of the most iconic T-shirts in the film is worn by the main character, Adelaide Wilson, played by Lupita Nyong’o. Adelaide wears a shirt with a rabbit on it, which becomes an important symbol throughout the movie. The rabbit, a creature often associated with fertility and reproduction, represents the duality of Adelaide’s character. The shirt foreshadows the reveal that Adelaide has a dark past and is, in fact, a “shadow” or doppelgänger.
Another T-shirt that carries symbolic weight is worn by Jason Wilson, Adelaide’s son, played by Evan Alex. Jason wears a Jaws T-shirt, which is significant because the movie Jaws is about a shark that preys on people. The T-shirt hints at the danger that lurks beneath the surface of the story and the characters’ lives.
The use of T-shirts in ‘Us’ is not limited to the main characters. The T-shirts that the doppelgängers wear are also important. The doppelgänger version of Adelaide wears a white T-shirt with a black spider on it. The spider symbolizes the web of lies and deceit that Adelaide has spun to hide her true identity.
The doppelgänger version of Gabe Wilson, Adelaide’s husband played by Winston Duke, wears a Howard University T-shirt. This T-shirt is significant because it suggests that the doppelgängers are a product of an experiment gone wrong, possibly related to the controversial Tuskegee experiment, in which the US government secretly studied the effects of untreated syphilis in black men.
The use of T-shirts in ‘Us’ is a prime example of how small details can have a significant impact on a story’s themes and meanings. Jordan Peele masterfully uses T-shirts to deepen the audience’s understanding of the characters and the world they inhabit. The T-shirts also serve as a way to foreshadow the twists and turns of the plot, adding an extra layer of tension to an already suspenseful movie.
In conclusion, ‘Us’ is a masterful horror-thriller that uses T-shirts as a storytelling device to great effect. The T-shirts add an extra layer of depth and meaning to the story, hinting at the duality of the characters and the societal issues the movie addresses. The use of T-shirts in ‘Us’ is a testament to the power of small details and their ability to enhance a story’s impact.
