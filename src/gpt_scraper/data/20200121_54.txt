Big Changes? Or Maybe Not. Putin’s Plans Keep Russia Guessing.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is often labeled as an authoritarian ruler who holds all the power in his hands and makes all the key decisions behind closed doors. However, even his own inner circle doesn’t always know what Putin is thinking or planning, especially when it comes to his major shifts in policy or personnel. This mysterious and unpredictable aspect of Putin’s leadership style has kept Russia guessing and speculating about what’s next.
Recently, rumors and some signals from the Kremlin have fueled the speculation that Putin may be considering some big changes in the near future. These changes could involve constitutional amendments that would allow him to extend his rule beyond 2024, when his current presidential term ends, or to restructure the political system in some significant ways. Another possibility is that Putin might reshuffle the top positions in the government or the ruling party, in order to consolidate his power or respond to public discontent.
However, as always with Putin, nothing is certain until it actually happens. Even if there are some preparations or discussions going on in the Kremlin, Putin may change his mind at any moment or keep his options open. He may also want to keep his rivals and advisers on edge, so they don’t feel too comfortable or complacent.
Moreover, there are some factors that may limit Putin’s room for maneuver or make him cautious about taking bold steps. One of them is the current economic and social situation in Russia, which is not favorable for any major experiments or disruptions. The declining oil prices, economic sanctions, and low public trust in the government create a challenging environment for any reforms or ambitious projects.
Another factor is the upcoming local and regional elections in Russia, scheduled for September 2020. These elections will serve as a test for the ruling party and its leaders, and any significant changes or controversies in the preceding months could jeopardize their chances. Putin may not want to risk his party’s dominance or his own image by making sudden or unpopular moves.
Therefore, it is possible that Putin will choose the path of stability and continuity, at least for the time being. He could maintain the status quo, consolidate his support among loyalists and officials, and focus on the topics that resonate with the public, such as security, patriotism, and traditional values. This approach could allow him to ensure his legacy and preserve his power without taking too many risks or facing too much resistance.
However, even if Putin doesn’t make any big changes in the near future, his plans and intentions will continue to shape Russia’s political landscape and international relations. His past actions and statements have demonstrated his ambition, assertiveness, and willingness to use any means necessary to pursue his goals. His agenda, whether overt or covert, may affect the stability and security of the region and the world, and may pose challenges or opportunities for other actors.
Therefore, while Russia, and the world, may keep guessing about Putin’s plans and preferences, it’s crucial to stay alert and informed about the context and potential consequences of his actions. The Russian bear may still be alive and well, or it may be in hibernation, or it may be planning a surprise attack. The only thing we can be sure of is that the bear won’t dance to anyone else’s tune.
