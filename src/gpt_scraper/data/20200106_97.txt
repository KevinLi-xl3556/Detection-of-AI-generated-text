Michelle Williams Tells Women to Vote for Their Rights at Golden Globes
At the 77th Golden Globe Awards held in January 2020, actress Michelle Williams delivered an impassioned speech urging women to vote for their rights. The speech was met with thunderous applause and garnered widespread praise from viewers and fellow celebrities alike.
Williams, who won the award for Best Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie for her role in Fosse/Verdon, used her acceptance speech to address issues that affect women in the entertainment industry and beyond.
“I’m grateful for the acknowledgment of the choices I’ve made, and I’m also grateful to have lived at a moment in our society where choice exists, because as women and as girls, things can happen to our bodies that are not our choice,” Williams said. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose.”
The actress went on to emphasize the importance of women’s rights, including the right to choose and the right to equal pay, and encouraged women to use their voices and their votes to effect change.
“So women, 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest,” Williams said. “It’s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them. But don’t forget, we are the largest voting body in this country. Let’s make it look more like us.”
Williams’ speech struck a chord with many, especially in light of recent efforts to restrict women’s access to reproductive healthcare and other basic rights. Her words served as a reminder that progress can only be made when women come together and demand change.
The reaction to Williams’ speech was overwhelmingly positive, with many praising her for using her platform to speak out on important issues.
“Michelle Williams’ speech is a reminder of how important it is for women to have a voice, especially when it comes to issues like reproductive rights,” said Jessica Valenti, a feminist writer and activist. “We need more women like her who are willing to speak out and use their platform to make a difference.”
Williams’ speech was also praised by fellow actors and actresses, including Patricia Arquette, who tweeted, “Thank you Michelle Williams for using your platform to stand up for women’s reproductive rights. Our bodies, our choice.”
In the wake of Williams’ speech, many women were inspired to become more politically active and involved in the fight for women’s rights. Her message serves as a powerful reminder that every vote counts, and that women must continue to speak out and demand change in order to create a more just and equitable society.
As Williams said in her speech, “So let’s vote in our own self-interest. Let’s take our power back. Let’s get out there and vote.”
