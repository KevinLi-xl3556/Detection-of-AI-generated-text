The world is currently facing many issues related to Justice and equality. These problems are not new and have always been present in society. However, the injustice of this moment is not an ‘aberration’ but rather a long-standing issue that has worsened.
From the unjustified murder of George Floyd in the United States, the ongoing oppression of Palestinians in Gaza, to the ongoing discrimination against minority groups everywhere, injustice has become prevalent in various forms around the globe.
In the United States, the criminal justice system and law enforcement agencies have largely failed to provide minorities with just and fair treatment. It is a common problem for black people to experience police brutality, unjustified arrests, and imprisonment.
The same goes for indigenous communities who face deprivation of their life, land, and resources. The tools of racism, namely marginalization and economic marginalization, continue to exert their force across the world.
One must comprehend that injustice does not operate in isolation. It is a systemic problem that runs through communities, cultures, and political systems. For instance, Countries like India and China have been criticized heavily for their oppression and curtailment of their citizens’ basic rights – they go as far as violating their freedom of speech.
The ongoing occupation of Palestine is another prime example of how this systemic discrimination operates. The Israelis continue to torture and kill Palestinians, violating all international human rights laws. Palestinian people are continuously expropriated, repressed, and used as targets for military exercises.
The ‘justice system’ has continued to fail the people, demonstrating that justice machinery is broken. It is the poor, underprivileged, and marginalized that seldom make justice in the eyes of our society.
The justice system has lost trust and credibility due to its repeated failure to hold those in power accountable adequately. There is a need to rebuild the system and restore faith in it.
This injustice needs to stop, and it should take significant efforts by governments, politicians, social activists, and ordinary citizens. Public awareness and education programs should be initiated to inform people regarding equality, justice, and human rights. Programs like awareness campaigns, rallies, and protests are essential in this regard.
The international community should engage more in the fight against injustice and rights abuses. More significant involvement of international organizations like the United Nations and International Migrants would be another important step towards restoring justice.
In conclusion, the ongoing problem with justice and inequality in various forms is not an ‘aberration,’ but rather a systemic issue that has been present for a long time. Governments and citizens worldwide must make an explicit commitment to fight racism, inequality, and injustice both in the present and the future. Only concerted efforts can bring about lasting change to the system and restore people’s faith in justice.
