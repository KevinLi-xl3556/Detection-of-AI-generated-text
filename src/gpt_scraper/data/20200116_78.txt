Nicolau was born in New York City in 1928 and served in the United States Army during World War II. After the war, he attended New York University and graduated with a law degree in 1951.

In 1985, Nicolau was selected to preside over the arbitration hearing for the first baseball collusion case, in which several teams were accused of conspiring to suppress player salaries.
Nicolau’s ruling in that case, which found the owners guilty of collusion and awarded the players $280 million in damages, was a major victory for the players’ union and paved the way for future arbitration cases involving baseball’s labor disputes. Nicolau went on to preside over several other high-profile cases, including the arbitration hearings involving the Minnesota Twins’ attempt to contract in 2002 and Alex Rodriguez’s suspension in 2014.
