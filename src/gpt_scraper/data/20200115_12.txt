In 2019, the world was shocked by the news of the notorious college admission scandal involving Hollywood actress Lori Loughlin, her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, and several other wealthy parents. The case exposed a dark side of higher education in the United States and revealed the extent to which wealthy individuals could buy their way into prestigious universities through bribery and fraud.
However, what many people may not know is how thoroughly the University of Southern California (USC) pursued Loughlin and Giannulli for donations before the scandal broke out.
According to a recent investigation by the Los Angeles Times, USC went to great lengths to court the couple, who had two daughters aspiring to attend the university. USC officials allegedly arranged multiple meetings with the couple and showered them with praise and attention.
One incident that stands out is a gala in March 2018, where USC president C. L. Max Nikias bestowed a special honor on Giannulli for his philanthropic contributions. Nikias reportedly praised Giannulli as “a visionary businessman and entrepreneur” and announced a $350,000 donation from the couple to support USC’s athletic programs.
However, what Nikias and other USC officials may not have known is that Giannulli’s fashion brand, Mossimo, was struggling financially at the time. According to court documents, the couple had to take out a loan of $2 million to make the first installment of the bribe they paid to secure their daughters’ admission to USC.
The investigation also reveals that USC had a longstanding practice of soliciting donations from wealthy families with connections to the entertainment industry. The university reportedly had a special office dedicated to celebrity outreach and tasked its athletic coaches with cultivating relationships with influential families.
In the case of Loughlin and Giannulli, USC saw the couple as potential mega-donors who could boost the university’s prestige and financial standing. The couple reportedly gave a total of $500,000 to USC’s athletic fund and participated in campus events and fundraisers.
The investigation raises questions about the ethics of university fundraising and the influence of wealthy donors on higher education. Critics argue that USC and other elite universities have become too reliant on big money donors and have compromised their academic integrity in the pursuit of prestige and profits.
Moreover, the scandal has highlighted the inherent inequality in the college admission process, where wealthy families can buy their way into elite schools while deserving low-income students are left behind. The Loughlin-Giannulli case has sparked a national conversation about the need for reform in higher education and the need to level the playing field for all students, regardless of their socioeconomic status.
In the end, the USC scandal shows that even the most prestigious and wealthy universities are not immune to corruption and greed. It also highlights the importance of transparency, accountability, and ethical practices in university fundraising and admissions. Only by upholding these values can we ensure that higher education remains a beacon of hope and opportunity for all.
