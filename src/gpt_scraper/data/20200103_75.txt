On January 3, 2020, President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that killed Qassem Suleimani, a powerful Iranian military commander. The decision was risky and controversial, with many wondering why other presidents had avoided taking such drastic measures.
Suleimani was the leader of the Quds Force, an elite unit within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that was responsible for conducting military operations outside of Iran’s borders. He was deemed responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers during the Iraq War, and he played a significant role in supporting various militias and terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine.
Despite Suleimani’s history of violence and hostility toward the United States, other American presidents had avoided taking lethal action against him. This was due in part to concerns about the potential repercussions of such an attack, which could include a major escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran, or even a full-blown war.
One of the main reasons why previous presidents had avoided targeting Suleimani was that he was seen as a powerful figure within Iran’s political and military spheres. Killing him could risk further destabilizing the already tumultuous region, and could lead to increased hostility, not only from Iran but from its many proxies in the region.
However, Trump, who has a reputation for being unconventional and unpredictable, chose to take the risk and order the strike against Suleimani. In a statement following the strike, the president claimed that he had taken the action to “stop a war” and to prevent further attacks against American citizens.
The decision was met with a mixed response from both domestic and international audiences. Critics of the decision argued that the strike was reckless and could lead to an all-out war, while supporters claimed that it was a necessary step to protect American lives and interests.
Perhaps the most significant consequence of the strike was the sudden escalation in tensions between the United States and Iran. In response to Suleimani’s killing, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq, which resulted in no casualties but raised fears of further conflict.
The decision to attack Suleimani was a risky one, and its long-term impact on American foreign policy in the Middle East remains to be seen. While previous presidents had avoided such a move, Trump saw it as a necessary step to protect American interests and to send a message to Iran and its proxies.
Whether or not the U.S. can find a way to de-escalate tensions with Iran and its allies in the region remains to be seen. However, one thing is evident: the decision to take out Suleimani was a bold move, and its consequences will be felt for many years to come.
