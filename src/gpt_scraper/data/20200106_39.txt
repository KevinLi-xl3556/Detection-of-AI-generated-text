The annual Golden Globe awards ceremony is one of the most prestigious events of the year in Hollywood. From the A-list celebrities strutting their stuff on the red carpet to the glamorous after-parties, the Golden Globes are a spectacle to behold.
The Before: Red Carpet Fever
The Golden Globes red carpet is arguably one of the most anticipated parts of the evening. It is a chance for stars to show off their fashion prowess and make a statement with their outfits. This year, there were many fashion highlights on the red carpet, from Jennifer Lopez stunning in a green and gold Valentino gown to Billy Porter’s dramatic white suit with a feathered train.
Alongside the fashion, the red carpet is also an opportunity for celebrities to speak out about causes close to their hearts. Many stars chose to make political statements this year, with the likes of Joaquin Phoenix and Michelle Williams using their speeches to speak about climate change and women’s rights respectively.
The After: Party Time
Once the awards have been handed out, the real partying begins. The Golden Globes after-parties are some of the most exclusive events in Hollywood. Celebrities and industry insiders gather to celebrate and let their hair down after a long night.
This year, the after-parties were as glamorous as ever. One of the most sought-after invites was to the InStyle and Warner Bros. after-party, where stars celebrated with cocktails and danced the night away. The Vanity Fair party was also a highlight, with stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Leonardo DiCaprio letting loose on the dance floor.
However, the after-parties are not just about partying. They are also a chance for celebrities to network and make deals. Many of the big Hollywood power players attend the after-parties, and it is not uncommon for major collaborations to be formed in these exclusive settings.
From the red carpet to the after-parties, the Golden Globes are a stunning display of glamour and opulence. While there may be winners and losers on the night, everyone involved comes away a winner after experiencing the excitement and thrill of Hollywood’s biggest night.
