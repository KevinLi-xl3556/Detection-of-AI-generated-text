Taiwan is a small island nation in East Asia that has been making headlines in recent years for its democratic government and its relationship with China. On January 11, 2020, Taiwan held its presidential election, which was closely watched by the international community. In this article, we will explore what you need to know about Taiwan’s presidential election.
Background
Taiwan is a democratic country with a population of 23.6 million people. It has a complex history, with its sovereignty being a contested issue. Taiwan was colonized by Japan from 1895 to 1945, and then it was returned to China after World War II. However, in 1949, the Communist Party of China declared victory over the Nationalist Party of China, and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan, where they established the Republic of China.
Since then, Taiwan has been a separate entity from mainland China, with its own government, economy, and culture. However, China has always claimed Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to reunify it with the mainland.
The 2020 Presidential Election
Taiwan’s presidential election is held every four years, and the winner serves a four-year term. The most recent election was held on January 11, 2020, and three candidates ran for the presidency: Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT), and James Soong of the People First Party (PFP).
Tsai Ing-wen won the election by a landslide, with 57.1% of the vote. Han Kuo-yu received 38.6% of the vote, and James Soong received 4.3% of the vote. Tsai’s victory was significant because she became the first president to win re-election since Taiwan became a democracy in the 1990s.
Tsai Ing-wen
Tsai Ing-wen was born on August 31, 1956, in Taiwan. She is a lawyer and a politician and has been the president of Taiwan since May 2016. Tsai is the first female president of Taiwan and the first president to be of Hakka descent.
Tsai is a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, which is a pro-independence party that seeks to maintain Taiwan’s sovereignty and resist China’s attempts to reunify it with the mainland. Tsai has been a vocal critic of China and has refused to acknowledge the “1992 Consensus,” which is an agreement between China and Taiwan that there is only “one China” but each side can interpret it differently.
Tsai’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was seen as a rejection of China’s attempts to influence Taiwan’s politics. It was also seen as a victory for Taiwan’s pro-democracy movement, which has been struggling against China’s increasing pressure and influence.
Future Implications
Taiwan’s presidential election has significant implications for the future of Taiwan’s relationship with China. China has been increasing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and has been exerting economic pressure on Taiwan in an attempt to force it to reunify with the mainland.
Tsai’s victory in the 2020 presidential election is likely to further strain relations between Taiwan and China. It is also likely to lead to an increase in tensions between the United States and China, as the United States has been a strong supporter of Taiwan and its democracy.
Conclusion
Taiwan’s presidential election was a significant event in the country’s history and has important implications for its relationship with China and the international community. Tsai Ing-wen’s victory was seen as a victory for Taiwan’s democracy and a rejection of China’s attempts to influence its politics. It remains to be seen how Taiwan and China will
