The Russian Hacking Plan for 2020: Understanding the Threat
With the 2020 US presidential election fast approaching, concerns around election security have never been higher. In 2016, Russian interference in the election was confirmed, with widespread hacking of political organizations and social media manipulation. As the election draws closer, what is Russia’s hacking plan for 2020, and what can be done to prevent it?
According to experts, Russia’s strategy for 2020 will be multifaceted and sophisticated. They will likely use a combination of old tactics and new technologies to achieve their goals. One key tactic will be phishing attacks, which involve sending seemingly legitimate emails to targeted individuals, with the goal of obtaining sensitive information or passwords. Phishing attacks were used extensively in 2016, and experts believe they will continue to be a favored tool of Russian hackers.
Another tactic that is likely to be used by Russian hackers in 2020 is the spread of disinformation and propaganda. Social media platforms, particularly Facebook, were used to spread misleading and divisive content in 2016, often targeting specific demographics. Experts predict that this will continue, with more sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms being used to create more convincing content.
Amongst the new technologies that Russian hackers may use in 2020, deepfakes are of great concern. Deepfakes are artificial videos or images that have been manipulated to show individuals saying or doing things they never actually said or did. These videos can be incredibly convincing and difficult to detect, meaning they have the potential to cause significant damage to candidates in the election.
So, what can be done to prevent Russian hacking in 2020? The first step is awareness. By understanding the tactics and techniques that Russian hackers will likely use, individuals and organizations can be more vigilant and take steps to protect themselves. Organizations should also invest in email security and employee training, to ensure that staff members are aware of the risks of phishing attacks.
Social media platforms must also take responsibility for election security. They are already taking steps to detect and remove misleading content, but more can be done. Governments should also work with technology companies to create standards for election security and provide funding for cybersecurity programs.
The 2020 election is shaping up to be one of the most important elections in US history, and it is imperative that it is conducted fairly and with integrity. By being aware of the tactics that Russian hackers are likely to use, we can better protect ourselves and prevent interference in the democratic process.
