After years of selling gluten-free baked goods at New York City’s Greenmarkets, a baker has finally found a permanent home for her business. Tara Smith, owner of The Gluten-Free Baker, recently opened a storefront in Brooklyn’s trendy Park Slope neighborhood.
Smith started her business several years ago after discovering she had celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that makes digesting gluten difficult. Unable to find baked goods that were both gluten-free and delicious, she began experimenting with recipes on her own. Eventually, she started selling her wares at local farmers markets.
“I had no business experience or training, but I knew I had something special,” Smith said. “People would come back week after week and tell me how much they loved my products.”
As demand for her goods grew, Smith began to consider opening a storefront. She knew she wanted to stay in the Park Slope area, where she lived, and she scoured the neighborhood for the perfect location. Finally, she found a cozy storefront on a quiet side street.
The Gluten-Free Baker sells all manner of baked goods, from breads and cupcakes to muffins and pies. Smith uses only natural ingredients, and she doesn’t skimp on flavor.
“People have this perception that gluten-free food has to be tasteless and boring,” she said. “But that’s simply not true. I use things like almond flour and coconut sugar to make my baked goods healthier, but they’re always delicious.”
The new storefront has been a hit with locals, who appreciate both the quality of the products and the friendly, neighborhood vibe. Smith is happy to finally have a permanent home for her business, but she still hasn’t forgotten her roots.
“I’m still at the Greenmarkets every week,” she said. “That’s where I got my start, and I love being a part of that community. But having a storefront has allowed me to take things to the next level. It’s been an amazing journey so far, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.”
