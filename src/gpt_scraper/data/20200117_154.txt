As the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump continues, Americans are settling in for what looks to be a protracted period of political drama. Late-night television hosts, in particular, are taking advantage of the situation, crafting monologues and skits around the latest developments in the proceedings.
The inquiry centers around a phone call that President Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July of 2019. During the call, Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son, Hunter Biden. The controversy has led to the launch of an impeachment inquiry by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
Late-night hosts have seized upon the situation, with many of them devoting entire segments to the topic. Some hosts, such as Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah, have used the opportunity to take aim at the president, critiquing his behavior and lambasting his alleged abuses of power. Others have opted for a more comedic approach, poking fun at the various players involved in the inquiry and using humor to call attention to the absurdity of the situation.
While some viewers may find the incessant coverage of the impeachment inquiry tiresome, others see it as an important opportunity to engage with politics and hold elected officials accountable. Late-night hosts have long been known for their satirical takes on the news, and the impeachment inquiry has provided them with yet another chance to use their platforms to dissect and criticize the actions of those in power.
Of course, it remains to be seen how the impeachment proceedings will ultimately play out, and whether or not Trump will be removed from office. Regardless of the final outcome, however, one thing is clear: Late-night television will continue to provide some much-needed laughs and entertainment during these challenging political times.
