In the novel “Cleanness” by Garth Greenwell, sex, violence, and self-discovery intersect in a luminous exploration of human desire and identity. Greenwell’s writing is precise and evocative, creating a vivid and intimate portrait of a young American teacher living in Bulgaria as he navigates the complexities of his relationships with others and himself.
At the heart of “Cleanness” is the protagonist’s exploration of his own sexuality. The novel is divided into nine interconnected stories, each focusing on a different aspect of his experiences with men. In one story, he explores the world of anonymous sex in public restrooms, finding both pleasure and danger in the illicit encounters he seeks out. In another, he is drawn into a relationship with a Bulgarian hustler, navigating the cultural differences and power imbalances that complicate their connection.
Throughout the novel, Greenwell’s writing is frank and explicit in its depiction of sexual acts. But even as he delves into the physical details of these encounters, he remains focused on the emotional and psychological states of his characters. “Cleanness” is not just a book about sex; it is a book about the ways in which sex can serve as a catalyst for deeper understanding and growth.
At the same time, violence is a recurring theme in “Cleanness.” Whether it takes the form of physical aggression, as when the protagonist is attacked in a park, or emotional abuse, as when he endures the cruel comments of a former lover, violence serves as a reminder of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface of even the most intimate relationships.
Yet despite the challenges he faces, the protagonist of “Cleanness” remains committed to his own journey of self-discovery. He seeks out connections with others, even as he recognizes the limitations of those connections. He grapples with his own past traumas and the ways in which they have shaped his desires and fears. And ultimately, he begins to find a sense of peace and clarity in the midst of all the turmoil.
“Cleanness” is a beautiful and haunting work of literature, one that asks its readers to confront the complexities of human desire and the ways in which our relationships with others shape who we are. With its luminous prose and unflinching honesty, it is a book that will stay with readers long after they turn the final page.
