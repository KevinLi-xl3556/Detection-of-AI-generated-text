The European Union’s new trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, has wasted no time in making clear his intentions to repair the damaged trade relations between the EU and the United States. Dombrovskis, who took over the position in December 2020, has said that he is committed to working with the Biden administration to find solutions to long-standing trade disputes between the two economic powers.
The transatlantic relationship between the EU and the US has been strained for several years now, with issues such as steel tariffs, digital taxation, and state subsidies for aircraft manufacturers causing tension between the two sides. However, with a new US administration in place, there is hope that the relationship can be reset and that a more constructive dialogue can be established.
Dombrovskis, who previously served as the European Commission’s executive vice president for an economy that works for people, has a wealth of experience in dealing with trade issues. He has emphasized the importance of a rules-based trading system and has called for a more level playing field in global trade.
In his new role as the EU’s trade chief, Dombrovskis has wasted no time in reaching out to his US counterparts. He has held talks with US Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and has expressed his desire to work with the Biden administration to find solutions to the outstanding trade issues between the two sides.
One of the key issues that Dombrovskis will be looking to address is the steel tariffs that the US imposed on the EU in 2018. The tariffs, which were imposed on national security grounds, have been a source of tension between the two sides, and the EU has responded with retaliatory measures of its own. Dombrovskis has said that he wants to find a solution to the steel tariffs that is acceptable to both sides, and that he is willing to engage in dialogue to achieve this.
Another issue that Dombrovskis will be looking to address is the digital taxation that the EU has proposed. The US has criticized the proposal, arguing that it unfairly targets US tech companies. However, Dombrovskis has said that the EU’s proposal is aimed at creating a level playing field for all companies that do business in the EU, and that he is willing to work with the US to find a solution that is mutually acceptable.
Overall, Dombrovskis’ quest to fix relations with the US is an important one for the EU. A strong transatlantic relationship is vital for both sides, and it is hoped that Dombrovskis’ experience and commitment to a rules-based trading system will help to rebuild trust between the EU and the US. If successful, this could lead to a more stable and prosperous global trading system, which would benefit both sides and the world as a whole.
