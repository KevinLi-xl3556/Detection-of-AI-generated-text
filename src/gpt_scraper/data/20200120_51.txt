Caneel Bay: Why a Caribbean Paradise Remains in Ruins
Caneel Bay Resort was once considered the crown jewel of Caribbean luxury tourism, nestled on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The resort, which had hosted celebrities and presidents alike, was known for its pristine beaches and world-class amenities. However, the resort has been closed since 2017 after Hurricane Irma ravaged the island, leaving the once-idyllic property in ruins.
Despite initial efforts by former owner, Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, to rebuild and reopen the resort, plans have been stalled due to a legal and financial dispute with the National Park Service, which owns the majority of the land on which the resort sits.
The resort was originally built in 1956 by Laurance Rockefeller, a conservationist and billionaire entrepreneur. Rockefeller was drawn to the area’s natural beauty and sought to preserve it by creating a resort that was environmentally sustainable and blended seamlessly with the surrounding nature.
However, the resort’s current state stands in stark contrast to its original vision. The grounds are overgrown with vegetation, the buildings are dilapidated, and the once-pristine beaches are littered with debris.
As the legal and financial dispute with the National Park Service continues, the future of Caneel Bay remains uncertain. Some locals and environmentalists argue that the resort should not be rebuilt at all, and instead, the land should be preserved for public use.
However, others believe that the resort is an important driver of the local economy and should be reopened to provide jobs and attract tourists back to the island. Additionally, some argue that reopening the resort could provide an opportunity to modernize and make the property more sustainable.
Despite the disagreements, one thing is clear: The fate of Caneel Bay will have a significant impact not only on the local economy but also on the environmental and cultural heritage of St. John. It remains to be seen what the final decision will be, but one can only hope that the future of Caneel Bay will honor the original vision of its founder and preserve the natural beauty of the island for generations to come.
