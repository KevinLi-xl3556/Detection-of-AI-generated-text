Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, recently announced their decision to step back as senior members of the Royal Family. While they are expected to spend most of their time in North America, they have chosen to base themselves in Canada, a country known for its welcoming attitude towards immigrants and refugees. However, despite their royal status and philanthropic work, they will not be receiving any special treatment in Canada.
Quite simply, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be treated like any other foreign citizens who wish to live in Canada. The Canadian government has made it clear that they will be responsible for their own security, and they will not receive any public funding or special treatment from the government. This means that they will have to pay for their own security, housing, and transportation, just like any other private citizen.
One reason for this decision is that Canada is a country that prides itself on treating everyone equally, regardless of their status or background. As a liberal democracy, Canada is committed to protecting and upholding the human rights of all individuals, and does not discriminate based on race, gender, religion, or nationality. As such, it would not be appropriate for the Canadian government to provide special treatment to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, as this would compromise the principles of fairness and equality that Canada values so highly.
Another reason for this decision is that there has been some controversy over how much time and money the Royal Family spends on public engagements and events. Some Canadians have criticized the Royal Family for being too expensive and not doing enough to earn their keep. By not giving special treatment to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Canadian government is sending a message that they expect all foreign citizens living in Canada to contribute to the country, whether through paying taxes, volunteering, or engaging in philanthropic work.
Of course, it is still entirely possible that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be welcomed with open arms in Canada. Canadians are known for their friendliness and hospitality, and many people are excited to have the couple living in their country. They may be invited to events and social gatherings, and could receive assistance from private security firms and other organizations. However, it is important to remember that they will not receive any official support or funding from the Canadian government.
In conclusion, while Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are certainly special individuals with many talents and accomplishments, they will not be receiving any special treatment in Canada. This is a testament to Canadaâ€™s commitment to equality and fairness, and should be viewed as a positive step towards creating a more just and inclusive society. Regardless of their royal status, the couple will be expected to contribute to Canadian society and abide by the same rules and regulations as every other foreign citizen.
