In the early hours of Wednesday, January 8th, 2020, Iran launched ballistic missile attacks on two military bases in Iraq where U.S. forces were housed - the Al Asad airbase in western Iraq and a base near Erbil in northern Iraq. The attacks came in retaliation for the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani on January 3rd.
With the attacks, the Iranian regime declared to have taken “fierce vengeance” on U.S. troops deployed in Iraq. The intense assault came shortly after a three-day mourning period for General Soleimani. Iranian leaders warned the United States and its allies in the region that any further aggression would face harsh retaliation.
The Pentagon confirmed that Iran’s attack hit multiple sites at Al Asad air base, including the runway and an aircraft maintenance area, but it did not report any casualties. The extent of the damage is yet to be fully evaluated. The base in Erbil also saw missile strikes, but again, there were no reports of casualties among the U.S. or coalition troops stationed at the facility.
In a speech later in the day, President Donald Trump addressed the nation and stated that there were no American casualties and little damage to the U.S. bases. He also added that the United States would immediately impose additional economic sanctions on Iran but did not make any mention of any further military action.
The attack took place amid rising tensions between Iran and the United States, following a series of events that started with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on December 31st by Iran-backed militants. The embassy attack led to the United States’ decision to carry out a targeted drone strike that killed Soleimani, a key figure in Iran’s military strategy.
Iran’s attack comes as a significant escalation of the ongoing conflict between the two countries, and this move has sparked concerns over whether the U.S. will respond with military force. Many experts predict a possible retaliation from the U.S. if Iran continues its aggression.
The situation in the Middle East is at its most fragile point in years, with Iran’s attack on the two U.S. bases bringing the area to the brink of war. The world is now watching anxiously as the two nations seem to be heading towards a more severe conflict.
