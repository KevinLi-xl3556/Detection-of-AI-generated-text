Carlos Ghosn, the former CEO of Nissan and Renault, made headlines around the world when he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of financial misconduct. After a dramatic escape from Japan in 2019, Ghosn eventually ended up in his childhood home of Lebanon, where he currently resides. However, even though he is now at home, Ghosn is still waiting for the next move in his ongoing legal battles.
Ghosn’s legal troubles began in November 2018, when he was arrested in Japan on charges of underreporting his income and using company funds for personal expenses. Ghosn denied the charges, but he was held in detention for over 100 days before being released on bail. However, just a few months later, Ghosn was rearrested on additional charges, including breach of trust.
After spending several months in detention, Ghosn made a daring escape from Japan in December 2019. He reportedly hid in a musical instrument case and was smuggled out of the country on a private jet. Ghosn eventually ended up in Lebanon, where he is a citizen and where he has family ties.
Despite being at home in Lebanon, Ghosn’s legal troubles have not gone away. In January 2020, Interpol issued a Red Notice for Ghosn’s arrest, at the request of the Japanese government. Ghosn has also been indicted in the United States, where he is accused of conspiring to underreport his income and using company funds for personal expenses.
Ghosn has maintained his innocence throughout the legal proceedings, and he has been highly critical of the Japanese legal system. He has accused Japanese prosecutors of using “hostage justice” tactics, and he has claimed that he was forced to confess to the charges against him.
In recent months, Ghosn has been in the news again, as he has launched a lawsuit against Nissan and Mitsubishi, seeking millions of dollars in compensation for what he claims was his wrongful dismissal from both companies. Ghosn has accused the companies of breach of contract and violating his human rights.
So, what’s next for Carlos Ghosn? It’s hard to say. While he may be safe from extradition in Lebanon, he still faces legal challenges in Japan and the United States. Ghosn has vowed to clear his name and has said that he will not stop fighting until he is vindicated.
In the meantime, Ghosn remains at home in Lebanon, where he is reportedly living a relatively quiet life. He has given a few interviews to the media, but he largely keeps to himself. It’s unclear what the future holds for Carlos Ghosn, but one thing is certain: his legal battles are far from over.
