In 1957, a new musical hit Broadway and stunned audiences with its gorgeous music and powerful story: West Side Story. Inspired by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, West Side Story tells the tale of two young lovers from rival gangs in 1950s New York City. With music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by a young Stephen Sondheim, the show was an immediate hit and went on to become a beloved classic.
Over 60 years later, West Side Story has been reborn in a new production directed by Tony Award winner Ivo van Hove. The new production features fresh choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and an updated script by Tony Award winner Tony Kushner.
The decision to update the script was a bold move, as the original production has long been celebrated for its groundbreaking depiction of racial tensions and the immigrant experience. However, Kushner’s revisions have been lauded by critics as a thoughtful and necessary reimagining of the story for modern audiences.
In an interview with The New York Times, Kushner explained his thought process when it came to updating the script. “We did this to honor the original and to honor the current moment,” he said. “It’s been over 60 years since the show premiered, and our country has changed a lot since then. We wanted to make sure that the story felt relevant and urgent.”
One of the most notable changes in the updated script is the addition of new Spanish-language dialogue, reflecting the large Hispanic population in contemporary New York City. The new production also features a more diverse cast than the original, with actors of color playing both the Sharks and the Jets.
The choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker is another major departure from the original production. While the original choreography by Jerome Robbins is beloved by many, De Keersmaeker’s work brings a fresh perspective to the show’s iconic dance sequences. Her choreography is more fluid and less stylized, giving the actors more room for expression and emotional depth.
The updated production has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. The New York Times praised van Hove’s “visually stunning and emotionally stirring” direction, while The Hollywood Reporter called it “a thrilling revival that honors the original while adding a contemporary edge.”
In addition to the updated production currently playing on Broadway, a new film adaptation of West Side Story is set to be released in December 2021. Directed by Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg, the film features a young and diverse cast and promises to be a powerful retelling of this beloved classic.
Sixty-four years after its premiere, West Side Story continues to captivate audiences with its timeless story of love, hate, and redemption. Through its numerous adaptations and updates, the show proves that its themes of racial tension and the immigrant experience are as relevant as ever.
