US President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is currently underway, with the Senate acting as the jury to decide his fate. However, Trump’s defense team has been causing controversy with their arguments, which have been described by legal experts as “constitutional nonsense.”
The Constitution allows for impeachment of a president who has committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Trump has been accused of inciting the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, which resulted in his impeachment. While legal experts agree that the evidence against Trump is strong, his defense team has taken a different approach.
One of their main arguments is that the trial is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office. This argument has been debunked by legal experts, including constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe, who tweeted: “Trump’s team is wrong: there’s nothing ‘unconstitutional’ about impeaching and trying a president who’s left office. Indeed, that was the practice in England and in some US states.”
Another argument made by Trump’s lawyers is that his speech on January 6th was protected by the First Amendment. While it is true that the First Amendment protects free speech, it does not protect speech that incites violence. Legal experts have also pointed out that Trump’s speech was not just free speech, but was an abuse of his power as president to incite a violent insurrection.
Trump’s defense team has also claimed that the impeachment is politically motivated and an attempt to “cancel” Trump and his supporters. However, legal experts have argued that the Constitution allows for impeachment for a reason, and that it is not a political vendetta but a necessary action to hold the president accountable for his actions.
The defense team’s arguments have been described by legal experts as “disingenuous,” “ridiculous,” and “absurd.” They have been accused of ignoring established legal precedent and pushing a narrative that is not supported by facts or the Constitution.
Ultimately, the Senate will decide whether to convict Trump or acquit him. However, the legal community’s consensus is that Trump’s defense team’s arguments are baseless and not rooted in the law. It remains to be seen whether the Senate will agree.
