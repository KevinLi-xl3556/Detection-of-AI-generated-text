In a stunning new development, a video has emerged that clearly shows two Iranian missiles striking the Ukrainian passenger plane that was shot down in January 2020. This tragic incident resulted in the deaths of all 176 people on board, including many Canadians, and had previously been blamed on human error.
The video, which was released by the New York Times on Tuesday, appears to be filmed from a rooftop near Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. In the footage, a bright light streaks across the sky before exploding, followed shortly by a second object that appears to be a missile.
The authenticity of the video has been confirmed by experts, who say it is consistent with satellite imagery and other evidence that has been collected. The video also challenges initial claims from Iranian officials that the plane was brought down by a technical malfunction.
The release of the video has drawn condemnation from the international community, with many calling for a full investigation into the incident. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the video “deeply shocking” and reiterated his call for a transparent and thorough investigation.
The Ukrainian authorities have also expressed their disappointment at the revelation. “We have repeatedly stated that the version of a missile hitting the aircraft as a result of an attack was considered right from the very beginning,” said the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry in a statement.
Iran initially denied responsibility for the crash, but eventually admitted that its military had mistakenly shot down the plane. The country’s armed forces claimed that they had misidentified the aircraft as a hostile target, and offered condolences and compensation to the victims’ families.
The release of this video is a significant development in the ongoing tragedy of Flight PS752. It highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in such incidents, and underscores the need for all countries to take steps to ensure the safety of civilian air travel. As the investigation continues, hopefully, the truth will come to light, and those responsible will be held accountable.
