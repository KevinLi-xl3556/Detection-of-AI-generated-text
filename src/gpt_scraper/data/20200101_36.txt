In 2019, there were many inspiring stories about equality that gave people hope and encouragement. From women’s rights to LGBTQ+ acceptance, people around the world fought for equality and made significant progress. In this article, we will take a look at some of the most remarkable stories that happened in 2019.


The Women’s Soccer Team
The U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team made headlines around the world in 2019 when they won the World Cup. The team was not only successful on the field, but they also became advocates for equal pay. They filed a lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, alleging that they were paid less than the men’s team despite their greater success. The lawsuit sparked a national conversation about gender inequality and fair pay, and it inspired many other female athletes to speak out about their own experiences.


LGBTQ+ Rights in Taiwan
In May 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. The landmark decision came after years of activism and advocacy by LGBTQ+ activists in the country. The law allows same-sex couples to register as married and grants them many of the same legal protections as heterosexual couples. The decision was widely celebrated around the world and gave hope to LGBTQ+ people in other parts of Asia where discrimination is still rampant.


Abortion Rights in Ireland
In 2019, Ireland passed a law that legalized abortion for the first time in its history. The country had some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, and the new law represented a major shift in public opinion. The decision was the result of years of activism by women’s rights groups and advocates, who fought tirelessly to change the law. The new law allows women to seek abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and in some cases, later on.


Women in Saudi Arabia
In 2019, Saudi Arabia made several important changes to its laws that gave women greater rights and freedoms. The most significant of these changes was the repeal of the country’s ban on female drivers. For decades, women in Saudi Arabia were not allowed to drive, but the ban was lifted in 2018. In 2019, the government also announced that women would be allowed to travel abroad without the permission of a male guardian. These changes were seen as significant steps forward for women’s rights in the country.


Racial Equality in the United States
In 2019, a number of important events brought attention to the ongoing struggle for racial equality in the United States. One of the most significant of these was the election of several new African American mayors in major cities across the country. These mayors represent a new generation of leaders who are committed to fighting racism and inequality. Additionally, the #BlackLivesMatter movement continued to gain momentum, as people across the country protested police brutality and systemic racism.


Overall, 2019 was a year of progress and hope for equality. These stories demonstrate that change is possible when people come together and fight for what is right. They give us hope that we can continue to make progress in the fight for equality, no matter how long and difficult the road may be.
