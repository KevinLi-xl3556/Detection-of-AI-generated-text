David Stern Saw Where the Sports World Was Headed Long Before It Got There
David Stern, the former commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), was a visionary leader who saw where the sports world was headed long before it got there. Stern, who passed away in 2020, is remembered for his many accomplishments during his 30-year tenure as NBA commissioner, but his foresight and leadership in navigating the league through the changing landscape of sports and media is perhaps his greatest legacy.
Stern became commissioner of the NBA in 1984, at a time when professional basketball was struggling to gain popularity and exposure. Under his leadership, the league experienced unprecedented growth and success, becoming a global powerhouse that now generates billions of dollars in revenue each year.
One of Stern’s greatest achievements was his recognition of the potential of television as a powerful tool for growing the NBA’s audience. He saw that television was not just a means of broadcasting games to fans, but also a way of telling stories, building drama, and creating personalities that fans could connect with. Stern worked tirelessly to negotiate lucrative television contracts that gave the NBA a regular presence on television, and he encouraged teams to market their stars as celebrities, not just athletes.
Stern also saw the potential of the internet long before most people did. He oversaw the launch of NBA.com in 1995, making the NBA one of the first professional sports leagues to have an online presence. Stern recognized that the internet was a powerful tool for engaging fans, building communities, and expanding the reach of the NBA beyond traditional media channels.
Another key area where Stern showed his foresight was in recognizing the importance of international markets for the NBA. Under his leadership, the league began to actively pursue global expansion, with games played in cities around the world and the establishment of international offices and partnerships. Today, the NBA has fans in virtually every corner of the globe, with players from more than 40 countries and games broadcast in more than 215 countries and territories.
Stern also saw the potential of social media as a way of engaging fans and creating buzz around the league. He encouraged players to use social media to connect with fans and build their personal brands, and he worked with social media platforms to create new ways of engaging with fans and promoting the league.
Stern’s vision and leadership were not always popular, and he faced criticism and opposition from many quarters during his tenure as commissioner. But his legacy speaks for itself, and his impact on the NBA and the sports world as a whole is undeniable. David Stern saw where the sports world was headed long before it got there, and he led the NBA through a period of unprecedented growth and success. His vision and leadership continue to shape the league and the broader sports world today, and his legacy will be felt for many years to come.
