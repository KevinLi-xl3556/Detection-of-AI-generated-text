As the popular TV show Mad Men came to a close, many fans found themselves wondering what they could watch next to fill the void. While there are many options out there, one show that has been gaining popularity among viewers is the Canadian dramedy, Kim’s Convenience.
Kim’s Convenience follows the lives of a Korean-Canadian family who run a convenience store in Toronto. The show deals with themes of family, identity, and cultural clashes in a lighthearted and comedic way, making it the perfect successor to Mad Men’s blend of drama and humor.
One of the reasons that Kim’s Convenience has been so successful is its relatable and diverse cast of characters. From the stern but caring patriarch, Mr. Kim (played by Paul Sun-Hyung Lee), to his daughter Janet (played by Andrea Bang), who is trying to balance her traditional Korean upbringing with her desire to fit in with her Canadian peers, the show’s characters are all multidimensional and complex.
Another thing that sets Kim’s Convenience apart from other shows is its emphasis on family. While Mad Men dealt with themes of work and identity, Kim’s Convenience focuses on the relationships between family members and the struggles that come with trying to balance tradition and modernity. This emphasis on family creates a sense of warmth and familiarity that draws viewers in and keeps them invested in the characters’ lives.
Finally, Kim’s Convenience is a refreshing change from the typical American sitcom format. While many shows rely on the same tired jokes and predictable storylines, Kim’s Convenience breaks the mold by offering a fresh perspective on immigrant culture and the struggles of trying to fit in while still maintaining one’s identity. The show’s writing is clever and engaging, and its humor is both smart and relatable.
In conclusion, if you’re looking for a show to fill the void left by Mad Men, look no further than Kim’s Convenience. With its diverse cast, emphasis on family, and unique perspective on immigrant culture, this Canadian dramedy is sure to leave you feeling both entertained and emotionally fulfilled. So grab some popcorn and settle in for a marathon of Kim’s Convenience – you won’t regret it!
