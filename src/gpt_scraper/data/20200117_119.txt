‘Abigail,’ by Magda Szabo: An Excerpt
Magda Szabo’s ‘Abigail’ is a powerful novel that tells the story of a young girl named Gina Vitay who is sent to a strict all-girls boarding school in Hungary during World War II. The novel follows her journey as she struggles to come to terms with her new life at the school, which is run by a strict headmistress who takes a particular interest in Gina.
One of the most striking features of ‘Abigail’ is the way that Szabo captures the sense of isolation and loneliness that Gina experiences as she adapts to her new surroundings. In the following excerpt, we see just how difficult it is for Gina to connect with her classmates, who seem to be more interested in gossip and drama than in making real friendships:
“As I walked into the school hall for lunch, I felt the weight of a hundred eyes on me. I knew that they were all talking about me behind my back, whispering and giggling as they always did. It was as if I was invisible to them, a ghost that they could never quite shake off.
I sat down at the table with the girls from my class, but they barely looked up from their plates. They were deep in conversation, laughing and chattering as if I wasn’t even there. I tried to join in, to make some sort of connection, but they just ignored me.
It was like this every day, and I began to feel like I was going crazy. I longed for some sort of human connection, for someone to talk to or confide in. But it seemed like I was the only one who felt this way.”
Szabo’s ability to capture the emotional turmoil of adolescence is truly remarkable, and ‘Abigail’ is a must-read for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. Through Gina’s struggles, we gain a deeper understanding of the universal human experience of loneliness and the importance of genuine connection.
Overall, ‘Abigail’ is a compelling novel that will stay with you long after you’ve finished reading it. With its vivid characters, beautiful prose, and powerful themes, it is a true masterpiece of Hungarian literature. If you haven’t already read it, I highly recommend that you do.
