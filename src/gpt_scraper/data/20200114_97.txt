The American political landscape has long been intertwined with wealth and power, and few families exemplify this relationship as distinctly as the Kushners and the Trumps. In her groundbreaking book, “American Oligarchs: The Kushners, the Trumps and the Marriage of Money and Power,” investigative journalist Andrea Bernstein delves into the history and inner workings of these two influential families, shedding light on their rise to prominence and the symbiotic relationship between money and politics in America.
In this excerpt, Bernstein takes us on a journey into the world of the Kushners and the Trumps, revealing how their paths crossed and how their shared pursuit of wealth and power has shaped American politics in profound ways.
The story begins with the Kushner family, headed by patriarch Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who built his fortune in the New York and New Jersey area. Bernstein paints a vivid picture of Charles Kushner’s rise from humble beginnings to becoming a formidable player in the world of real estate, navigating the complexities of politics and business with equal skill. She traces the Kushner family’s ascent, from their early years in New Jersey to their forays into Manhattan, where they made connections with influential figures in the political and financial spheres.
As the Kushner family’s wealth and influence grew, their paths crossed with another family that would come to define modern American politics - the Trumps. Bernstein delves into the intertwined history of the Kushner and Trump families, revealing how their destinies became intertwined through business dealings and personal relationships. She uncovers the web of connections between Charles Kushner and Donald Trump, including their shared interest in real estate development and their mutual affinity for leveraging wealth and power for political gain.
Bernstein also shines a light on the marriage between Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter, and Jared Kushner, Charles Kushner’s son. She reveals how their union brought together two families with a shared ambition for political power, and how they navigated the complex dynamics of family, business, and politics in the White House during Donald Trump’s presidency.
Through meticulous research and in-depth interviews, Bernstein paints a compelling portrait of the Kushners and the Trumps as American oligarchs - wealthy families with immense influence in politics and business.
