In recent years, many Americans have expressed concerns about the direction in which their country is headed. The once robust economy and stable political landscape have been replaced with division, polarization, and an increasingly hostile public discourse. Some argue that the root of this societal decay can be traced directly to one person: former President Donald Trump.
Trump’s time in office was marked by controversy, scandal, and a seemingly endless stream of divisive rhetoric. From the moment he announced his candidacy, he launched a barrage of attacks on immigrants, minorities, and political opponents. He encouraged his followers to engage in violence and reinforced racist and sexist stereotypes at every turn. His erratic behavior, disregard for democratic norms, and attacks on the media further undermined public trust in institutions and made it clear that he saw himself above the law.
What is perhaps most troubling about the four years of Trump’s presidency is the way that his evil seems to have infected others. Supporters who once seemed to hold moderate or even liberal views began parroting his extremist views, adopting his violent rhetoric, and espousing conspiracy theories. In online forums and social media, hate speech and harmful disinformation proliferated.
Even in the era of Covid-19, Trump demonstrated a willingness to put himself before the safety of the American public. He continued to hold crowded rallies, despite warnings from public health officials that they could turn into superspreader events. He downplayed the severity of the virus, politicized the use of masks and vaccines, and even suggested that injecting disinfectants into the body could be a viable treatment.
This willingness to endanger others, combined with his shameless disregard for truth and ethics, did not go unnoticed. Following the 2020 election, Trump refused to concede and launched baseless claims of voter fraud. He encouraged his followers to storm the Capitol building during the certification of the electoral college vote, resulting in a violent insurrection that left five people dead.
Trump’s evil is contagious, and the damage he has done to the fabric of American society will be felt for years to come. It is up to individuals, communities, and institutions to recognize the harm that he has caused and work to rebuild a more just and equitable society. Only by rejecting the toxic ideology that he represents can we hope to move forward and build a brighter future for all Americans.
