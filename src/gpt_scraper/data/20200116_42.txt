As I walk upon the pebbled shore
I close my eyes and breathe once more
The salty breeze and peaceful sound
Of waves upon this sacred ground
I’ve returned to my home, my heart
Nushagak, where my soul does start
With memories of childhood past
And stories of a time that lasts
The river rushes, strong and true
A path for fish and people too
A way of life that’s rooted deep
In history that we all shall keep
The mountains, tall and grandiose
A sight that makes us all suppose
Of a power greater than our own
A force that we have always known
The eagle flies above my head
A symbol of freedom, it is said
It soars with grace and majesty
A sight that fills my heart with glee
Oh, Nushagak, my heart’s pure home
Where memories and dreams have grown
With every step, I feel the pride
Of a people that’s not been denied
For we are strong, we are resolute
Our love for this land is absolute
We honor tradition, we move ahead
With open hearts and minds instead
So, as I stand upon this shore
I know that I could ask for more
Than to return to my heart’s true place
The land that gives me strength and grace.
