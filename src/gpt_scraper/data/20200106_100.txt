The NFL playoffs kicked off with a bang this year, as the Wild-Card round delivered some truly thrilling games. With six matchups over two days, fans were treated to some of the most exciting football of the season. Here’s what we learned from the N.F.L.’s Wild-Card round:

Defense still wins championships.

It’s a cliche, but it’s true. The teams that played the best defense in the Wild-Card round were the ones that came out on top. The San Francisco 49ers held the Dallas Cowboys to just 17 points, while the Buffalo Bills limited the New England Patriots to just 14. The Los Angeles Rams also put in a strong defensive performance, holding the Arizona Cardinals to just 11 points. In a league where high-powered offenses often steal the show, it’s clear that defense still has a big role to play.

The underdogs can still pull off an upset.

In the Wild-Card round, three of the six games were won by the lower-seeded team. The Las Vegas Raiders beat the Cincinnati Bengals in a thrilling overtime game, while the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers also came away with unexpected victories. This just goes to show that anything can happen in the playoffs, and that the underdogs should never be counted out.

Quarterbacks matter, but they’re not everything.

We all know that quarterbacks are the most important players on the field, but the Wild-Card round proved that they’re not the only ones who can make an impact. The Bills’ Josh Allen and the Dallas Cowboys’ Dak Prescott both put in strong performances, but it wasn’t enough to secure a victory for their teams. Meanwhile, the 49ers’ Jimmy Garoppolo and the Rams’ Matthew Stafford both had their share of struggles, but their defenses and running games helped carry them to victory.

The weather can be a game-changer.

With several games played in cold and snowy conditions, it was clear that the weather had an impact on the outcomes. The Bills and the Patriots had to deal with heavy snowfall and high winds, while the Philadelphia Eagles struggled in a rain-soaked game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Teams that are used to playing in warm weather or in domes may struggle when the elements come into play.

Coaching matters.

The Wild-Card round showed us that good coaching can make all the difference. The Raiders’ interim head coach Rich Bisaccia led his team to an upset victory over the Bengals, while the 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan made some bold play calls that paid off in their win over the Cowboys. On the other hand, the Patriots’ Bill Belichick was out-coached by the Bills’ Sean McDermott, which contributed to their early exit from the playoffs.
Overall, the N.F.L.’s Wild-Card round gave us plenty of exciting moments and valuable lessons. As we move on to the Divisional round, it’s clear that anything can happen in the playoffs, and that every team will need to bring their best if they want to advance to the next round.
