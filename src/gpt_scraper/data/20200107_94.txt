How Cassius Winston Greets His Late Brother Before Every Michigan State Game
Cassius Winston is a name that has become synonymous with basketball excellence. The former Michigan State guard was a two-time All-American, a two-time Big Ten Player of the Year, and the recipient of the 2020 Bob Cousy Award, given to the best point guard in the country. But while his accomplishments on the court are remarkable, it is his relationship with his late brother that has captured the hearts of many.
On November 9, 2019, Cassius’ younger brother Zachary tragically died after being struck by a train. Zachary was just 19 years old and had aspirations of playing college basketball like his older brother. The news of his passing rocked the Michigan State community, but none more so than Cassius.
In the wake of Zachary’s death, Cassius took a brief hiatus from basketball to be with his family. But when he returned to the court, he did so with a heavy heart and a renewed purpose. He was determined to honor his brother’s memory every time he stepped onto the court.
Before every game, Cassius takes a moment to honor his late brother. He touches the “Z” that he has written on his shoes, and he takes a deep breath. It is a moment of reflection and remembrance, a moment to gather his thoughts and emotions before the game begins.
But Cassius’ tribute to his brother goes beyond just a simple gesture before the game. He also wears a bracelet with the words “Forever my brother” on it, a reminder of the bond he shared with Zachary. And after every game, win or lose, Cassius takes a moment to look up to the sky and say a prayer for his brother.
For Cassius, honoring his brother’s memory is about more than just basketball. It is about keeping his brother’s spirit alive and reminding himself of the importance of family, love, and the pursuit of dreams. In an interview with The Undefeated, Cassius spoke about the impact his brother had on his life.
“He was my little brother, but I looked up to him in so many ways,” Cassius said. “He taught me so much about life, about being a good person, about never giving up on your dreams. And even though he’s not here with me now, I carry his memory with me every day. He’s my motivation to be the best version of myself.”
Cassius’ dedication to his brother’s memory has not gone unnoticed. During his senior season at Michigan State, the team wore “Zachary” patches on their jerseys, a tribute to the impact Zachary had on the Spartan family. And when Cassius was selected in the second round of the 2020 NBA draft by the Washington Wizards, he wore a suit jacket with the words “Long Live Z” embroidered on the inside.
The bond between Cassius and Zachary Winston is one that will never be broken, and Cassius’ dedication to honoring his brother’s memory is a testament to the power of love, family, and perseverance. As he continues his basketball journey at the professional level, it is clear that Zachary will always be with him, inspiring him to reach new heights and reminding him of the importance of never giving up on your dreams.
