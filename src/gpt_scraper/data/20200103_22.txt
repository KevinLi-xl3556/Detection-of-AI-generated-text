Sam Wyche, the former NFL coach who led the Cincinnati Bengals to their second Super Bowl appearance, has passed away at the age of 74. Wyche, who had been battling melanoma, died at his home in Pickens, South Carolina on Thursday, January 2nd, 2020.
Wyche was a beloved figure in the NFL, known for his innovative offensive strategies and his charismatic personality. He was a successful quarterback in college and in the NFL, playing for the University of South Carolina and for the Cincinnati Bengals and other teams during his professional career. However, it was as a coach that Wyche truly made his mark on the sport.
In 1984, Wyche was hired by the Cincinnati Bengals as their head coach, and he quickly established himself as one of the league’s most innovative offensive minds. He installed the “no-huddle” offense, which allowed his team to run plays without huddling up first, catching defenses off-guard and putting pressure on them to keep up. This strategy helped lead the Bengals to a division title in 1988, and then to the Super Bowl the following season.
In Super Bowl XXIII, the Bengals faced off against the San Francisco 49ers in what would be one of the most thrilling games in NFL history. The Bengals took the lead late in the game, but the 49ers drove down the field in the final minutes to score the winning touchdown. Although the Bengals ultimately fell short, Wyche’s coaching strategy and leadership had brought them closer to a championship than they had ever been before.
Wyche went on to coach for several other NFL teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Buffalo Bills, before retiring in 2006. He was widely respected as a coach and as a person, known for his friendly demeanor and his dedication to his players and his community.
News of Wyche’s passing has been met with an outpouring of grief and tributes from the NFL community. Bengals owner Mike Brown released a statement calling Wyche “a great coach and a great man”, while former Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason tweeted that he was “deeply saddened” by the news. Wyche’s legacy in the NFL will undoubtedly live on, as his innovative strategies and charismatic personality continue to inspire coaches and players alike.
