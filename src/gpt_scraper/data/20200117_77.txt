Yesterday’s Bread, Today’s Lush Fatteh
Food wastage is one of the most significant global issues today. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted every year, amounting to approximately 1.3 billion tons. While it is important to reduce food waste, we can also minimize its impact by turning yesterday’s bread into today’s delightful food.
Fatteh is a Middle Eastern dish that has recently gained popularity worldwide. It is a rich and flavorful dish that can be made with a variety of ingredients, but the main foundation is day-old bread. The word “Fatteh” comes from the Arabic word “Fatt” which means crumbly, and it is usually layered with meat, vegetables, and a yogurt or tahini sauce.
To make an incredible Fatteh, all you need is stale bread, some leftover meat or chickpeas, yogurt or tahini, and a few simple toppings like spices, nuts, and herbs. Here is a simple recipe to make a classic Fatteh:
Ingredients:
• 3 cups of stale bread, preferably pita bread, cut into bite-sized pieces
• 1 cup of leftover chicken, lamb or beef, shredded
• 1 cup of cooked chickpeas or fava beans
• 2 cups of full-fat plain yogurt or tahini sauce
• 2 cloves of garlic, grated
• 1-2 teaspoons of ground cumin
• 1/4 chopped parsley or mint leaves
• Salt and pepper to taste
• 1/2 cup of pine nuts or other nuts (optional)
• Olive oil, for frying
Instructions:


Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the bread pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast them until they are crispy and browned. This should take 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, you can fry the bread in a large pan on medium-low heat with some olive oil until crispy and browned.


In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the yogurt or tahini, grated garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper.


Layer the bread, meat or chickpeas, and the yogurt or tahini sauce in a large serving bowl.


Garnish the top of the Fatteh with chopped parsley or mint leaves, pine nuts or any nuts of your preference, and a drizzle of olive oil.


Serve immediately and enjoy!
