Gender and electability have been key topics of discussion and debate in the 2020 Democratic race. Women have made their mark in politics in recent years, but as the 2020 election approaches, many are still questioning whether a woman can be elected president of the United States.
Female candidates in the Democratic race include Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar. While they have been successful in many aspects, they have faced challenges and criticisms specifically due to their gender. Some argue that voters may be hesitant to vote for a woman due to outdated sexist beliefs or fear of a woman in power.
However, there is no evidence to support the belief that a female candidate is inherently less electable than a male candidate. In fact, in the 2018 midterm elections, a record number of women were elected to Congress, suggesting that the public is more open to female politicians than ever before.
Another issue related to gender in the Democratic race is the phenomenon of “electability” - the idea that a candidate’s perceived ability to win the election is more important than their policy positions or qualifications. Historically, “electability” has often been used as a code word for candidates who are white, male, and establishment-backed, rather than an accurate measure of who can actually win an election.
Some argue that focusing too much on electability can backfire and ultimately harm the party. For example, in 2016, many argued that Hillary Clinton was the most “electable” candidate, but she ultimately lost the election to Donald Trump. This suggests that focusing solely on electability at the expense of policy positions and qualifications can be a costly mistake.
Ultimately, the issues of gender and electability in the Democratic race are complex and multifaceted. While there are certainly challenges women face in breaking the highest political barrier, it is important to challenge outdated sexist beliefs and resist the urge to prioritize electability over other important factors. Let us support and elect the candidate who most closely aligns with our values and beliefs, regardless of their gender.
