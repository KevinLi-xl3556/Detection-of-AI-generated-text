Alphabet’s Chief Legal Officer Stepping Down Amid Investigation
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has announced that its Chief Legal Officer, David Drummond, will be stepping down from his position following an investigation into his conduct. Drummond, who has been with the company for over 20 years, has been under scrutiny for his handling of various workplace misconduct allegations.
The investigation, which was conducted by an external law firm, reportedly found that Drummond had engaged in relationships with multiple employees over the years, including one woman who claims she was forced to leave the company after their relationship ended. The investigation also found that Drummond had been involved in the company’s decision to pay a $90 million exit package to Android creator Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct.
Drummond’s departure comes amid increasing scrutiny of tech companies’ handling of workplace misconduct allegations, particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Alphabet has faced criticism in the past for its handling of sexual harassment claims, leading to a massive walkout of employees in 2018.
In a statement, Drummond acknowledged the investigation and apologized for his actions. “I accept responsibility for my role in the situation that has led us to this point,” he said. “I regret the hurt that I’ve caused to people who I’ve worked with and loved during my time at Google.”
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also issued a statement, thanking Drummond for his years of service to the company. “We’re grateful for Dave’s contributions over the years and we wish him all the best,” Pichai said. “We’ll continue our work to ensure that Google is a safe and inclusive workplace for everyone.”
Drummond’s departure is the latest in a string of high-profile exits from Alphabet in recent years. In 2019, the company’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, stepped down from their positions as CEO and President, respectively. Earlier this year, Ruth Porat, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, announced her departure as well.
The news of Drummond’s departure also comes at a time when Alphabet is facing increased regulatory scrutiny. The company is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged antitrust violations, and faces ongoing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators around the world.
Despite these challenges, Alphabet remains one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world. With a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, the company dominates the search and online advertising industries, and has made significant investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.
As Alphabet continues to navigate these challenges, the company will need to focus on building a workplace culture that is inclusive, respectful, and transparent. The departure of David Drummond may be a step in the right direction, but it’s clear that much more work needs to be done to ensure that Alphabet is a company that employees can be proud to work for.
