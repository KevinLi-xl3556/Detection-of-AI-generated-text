Australia Fires, Oyo, Martin Scorsese: Your Friday Briefing
As another week comes to a close, here is your Friday briefing on some of the most notable events of the past week.
Australia Fires:
The devastating fires in Australia continue to wreak havoc, with the death toll now at 33 and over 2,500 homes destroyed. The fires, which have been burning since September 2019, have also resulted in the loss of countless animals, with estimations stating that up to a billion animals have been killed. The Australian government has been heavily criticized for their lack of action in addressing the issue of climate change, which many argue is a key factor in the intensity and duration of the fires.
Oyo:
Indian hospitality start-up Oyo has announced plans to lay off around 5,000 employees globally, with the majority of the job cuts in its home country. The company, which has been hailed as one of India’s most promising start-ups, has faced criticism for its business practices and treatment of hotel owners. The move to cut jobs has been described as a cost-cutting measure and a response to market conditions.
Martin Scorsese:
Legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese has caused a stir this week with his comments on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In an interview with Empire magazine, Scorsese stated that the films in the Marvel franchise are “not cinema,” comparing them more to “theme parks.” His comments have been met with a mixed response, with many defending the artistic and cultural value of superhero films and others agreeing with Scorsese’s assessment.
In addition to these events, this week has also seen the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump in the United States, ongoing Brexit negotiations in the UK, and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.
As we head into the weekend, it is important to reflect on the events of the past week and consider our role in addressing the issues facing our world. From the devastating fires in Australia to the treatment of employees in the business world, there are many issues that demand our attention and action. Let us use our time this weekend to consider how we can make a positive difference in our communities and beyond.
