The Oscars are one of the biggest events of the year in Hollywood. The glitz, glamor, and recognition that comes with winning an Academy Award is what makes the ceremony so special. However, with every passing year, there are new trends and changes in the film industry that can be seen in the nominees, winners, and general atmosphere of the Oscars.
One trend that has been noticed in recent years is the industry’s fondness for nostalgia. In 2019, Hollywood seemed to be fixated on reviving classic movies and franchises that had been dormant for years. From “Mary Poppins Returns” and “Mary Queen of Scots,” to “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” and “Creed II,” studios seemed to be banking on the audience’s love for nostalgia-filled throwbacks.
While this trend was more obvious in the movie offerings, it also made its way to the Oscars. Several movies nominated in 2019 (such as “Bohemian Rhapsody”) offered a tribute to past events and icons in a manner that felt nostalgic. The ceremony itself was also infused with nostalgia, with the producers recreating a classic musical moment with the cast of “Bohemian Rhapsody.”
So, will the Oscars continue to follow the trend of Hollywood’s 2019 nostalgia fix?
It is likely that the Oscars will continue to feel a twinge of nostalgic. The movie industry has always been drawn to nostalgic themes, and it’s not a surprise that this has carried over into the ceremony itself. Plus, the audience always loves a nod to the past, whether it is a tribute performance or a reference to classic films.
However, it is important to note that the Oscars do not follow a specific formula. Every year, the Best Picture nomination pool is completely different from the previous year, and the academy’s values and ideals shift with each generation. Therefore, it is possible that the nostalgia fixation will not be as strong in the future years.
In the end, the Oscars will go wherever the audience and industry take it. While it is fascinating to see a palette of nostalgic offerings, it also important to see fresh ideas and untapped visions. After all, Hollywood is about dreaming the impossible and pushing boundaries to create magic for the audience. The Oscars has to follows that mission, and never have to be trapped in following trends, retro or not.
