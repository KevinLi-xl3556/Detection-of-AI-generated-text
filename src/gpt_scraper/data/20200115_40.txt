The Supreme Court of the United States recently heard a case involving age bias, but the discussion during the hearing took a peculiar turn as the Justices began discussing both “O.K. Boomer” and eggless cakes.
The case before the court, Babb v. Wilkie, involves a pharmacist who claimed that she was denied promotions within the Department of Veterans Affairs due to her age. The main issue at hand is whether a plaintiff in an age discrimination case needs to prove that age was the sole factor in the employer’s decision, or if it was simply a contributing factor.
However, during the hearing, Justice Samuel Alito brought up the recent cultural phenomenon of “O.K. Boomer,” a dismissive phrase often used by younger generations towards older generations. Alito wondered if the use of such language could be evidence of age discrimination in the workplace.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor responded by saying that while she believes the phrase can be evidence of age bias, it’s not necessarily definitive. “It’s just shorthand for saying, ‘I’m dismissing you. I’m not taking you seriously because you’re older,’” she said.
The conversation then took another odd turn when Justice Neil Gorsuch brought up the issue of eggless cakes. The case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, involved a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple due to his religious beliefs. During that hearing, the Justices discussed whether the baker’s refusal constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.
Gorsuch brought up the issue of eggless cakes in the context of the Masterpiece case, wondering if a vegan baker could refuse to make a cake with eggs for a non-vegan customer. He then asked if such a refusal would constitute discrimination.
While the discussion of “O.K. Boomer” and eggless cakes may seem tangential to the issue of age discrimination, it’s not uncommon for the Justices to bring up seemingly unrelated topics during oral arguments. These discussions can sometimes provide insight into the Justices’ thinking on certain issues, and can also make for interesting headlines.
In any case, the outcome of Babb v. Wilkie is still uncertain, and it remains to be seen how the Justices will ultimately rule. But for now, we can at least say that the hearing sparked some unusual discussions.
