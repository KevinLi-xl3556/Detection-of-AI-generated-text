The legal industry has traditionally been known for its conservative nature and resistance to change. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards innovation and technology adoption in the legal sector. Two tech titans who are leading this revolution are Eric Tsytsylin and Rony Rothken.

However, the adoption of technology in the legal industry is not without its challenges.

Tsytsylin and Rothken are working to overcome this resistance by educating lawyers on the benefits of legal tech and how it can improve their practice.
