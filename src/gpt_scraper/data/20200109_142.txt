In the wee hours of the morning, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to assure the American public that “all is well” following the Iranian missile strikes on two U.S. military bases in Iraq. However, late-night hosts were quick to express their doubts about the president’s assessment.
On “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” the host mocked Trump’s tweet, saying, “When I want a president to assess the state of the union, I always turn to Twitter.” Colbert went on to say that Trump’s tweet was about as comforting as a doctor saying “all is well” after a colonoscopy.
On “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” the host also poked fun at Trump’s tweet, saying, “I don’t know about you guys, but when I hear ‘all is well’ from Donald Trump, I immediately grab my bug-out bag and head for the hills.” Meyers also criticized Trump for not addressing the nation in a more traditional manner.
Meanwhile, on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” the host pointed out that “all is well” is not a phrase typically used to describe a situation where missiles are flying back and forth between two countries. Noah also criticized Trump for not having a plan in place for the aftermath of the attack.
The skepticism expressed by late-night hosts reflects a larger concern among the American public about the state of the country under the Trump administration. Many people feel that Trump’s impulsive decision-making and lack of a coherent foreign policy have put the nation in danger.
While it is true that no Americans were killed in the Iranian missile strikes, the situation remains tense and volatile. It is unclear how Iran will respond to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and there is a risk of further escalation in the conflict.
As the situation unfolds, it is important for the president to address the American people in a calm and reassuring manner. Late-night hosts may provide some much-needed comic relief in these trying times, but ultimately it is up to the president to lead the nation through this crisis.
