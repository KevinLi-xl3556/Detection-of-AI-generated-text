Word + Quiz: Anachronistic
Welcome to the latest edition of Word + Quiz! Today’s featured word is “anachronistic,” a term that refers to something that is out of its proper time period or that does not fit in with the current era. Anachronisms can occur in literature, art, technology, and even language. In this article, we’ll explore the concept of anachronisms and how they can be identified.
Anachronisms in Literature and Art
One of the most common places to find anachronisms is in literature and art. This can occur when an author or artist includes elements in their work that do not fit with the time period in which the work is set. For example, if a novel set in the 1800s features characters using cell phones, that would be an anachronism.
Another example of anachronism in literature can be found in William Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar. In the play, characters wear togas, which is accurate for the time period in which the play is set. However, there is a scene where a clock chimes, which would not have existed in ancient Rome. This is an example of an anachronism in literature.
Anachronisms in Technology
Anachronisms can also occur in technology. This happens when a piece of technology is used in a way that does not fit with the time period in which it is set. For example, if a movie set in the 1950s features characters using smartphones, that would be an anachronism.
An example of an anachronism in technology can be found in the television show Mad Men. The show is set in the 1960s, but there are several scenes where characters are using computers. While computers did exist in the 1960s, they were not as widely used as they are today. This is an example of an anachronism in technology.
Anachronisms in Language
Anachronisms can also occur in language. This happens when a word or phrase is used in a way that does not fit with the time period in which it is set. For example, if a movie set in the 1920s features characters using slang words that were not in use at the time, that would be an anachronism.
An example of an anachronism in language can be found in the movie Forrest Gump. The movie is set in the 1960s and 1970s, but the character of Forrest Gump uses the phrase “shit happens,” which did not come into common usage until the 1980s. This is an example of an anachronism in language.
Identifying Anachronisms
Identifying anachronisms can be a fun exercise for readers, viewers, and listeners. When reading a novel or watching a movie, look for elements that do not fit with the time period in which the work is set. For example, if a character in a historical novel talks about their iPhone, that would be an anachronism.
In conclusion, anachronisms are elements that do not fit with the time period in which a work is set. They can occur in literature, art, technology, and language. Identifying anachronisms can be a fun exercise for those who enjoy history and the art of storytelling. So, the next time you read a novel or watch a movie, keep an eye out for anachronisms and see if you can spot them!
