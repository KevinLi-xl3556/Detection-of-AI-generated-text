The Venice Biennale, one of the world’s most prestigious art exhibitions, has announced that Cecilia Alemani has been named as the curator of the 59th edition, which is set to take place in 2023. Alemani, an Italian-born curator, has a wealth of experience in the art world and is known for her innovative approach to curating.
Alemani is currently the director and chief curator of High Line Art, a public art program in New York City that showcases contemporary art in public spaces. She has also curated exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Istanbul Biennial, and the Milan Triennale.
The theme of the 59th Venice Biennale, as announced by Alemani, is “May You Live In Interesting Times.” This theme is inspired by a traditional Chinese curse that refers to times of uncertainty and upheaval. Alemani hopes to use the exhibition to explore the political, social, and economic challenges that we face today, as well as the role that art can play in addressing these challenges.
Alemani has stated that she wants to create an exhibition that is “visually spectacular, intellectually challenging, and emotionally engaging.” To achieve this, she plans to work closely with artists from around the world to create a diverse and dynamic exhibition that reflects the complex and multifaceted nature of our global society.
One of the challenges that Alemani faces as the curator of the Venice Biennale is the current global pandemic. With many countries still grappling with the effects of COVID-19, it is uncertain whether the exhibition will be able to take place as planned. However, Alemani remains optimistic and is working closely with the Biennale’s organizers to ensure that the exhibition can be held safely and effectively, whether in person or online.
The Venice Biennale, which was first held in 1895, has a long and storied history. It is considered one of the most important events in the contemporary art world and attracts artists, curators, and art lovers from around the globe. With Cecilia Alemani at the helm, the 59th Venice Biennale is sure to be an exciting and thought-provoking exhibition that pushes the boundaries of contemporary art and challenges us to think deeply about the world we live in.
