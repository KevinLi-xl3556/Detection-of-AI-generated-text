If you’re like most people, you probably know someone who has received a text claiming that they have been drafted into the army. The sudden and potentially life-changing news can be quite scary, especially for those who have no intention of serving in the military. However, the United States Army has recently come forward to clarify that these texts are completely fake.
The Army has been inundated with inquiries from concerned citizens who have received text messages telling them that they have been selected for the draft. The messages also warn that failure to respond could result in legal consequences, including fines or even jail time. These fake messages come at a time of increased tension in the world, and concerns about the possibility of a new conflict breaking out.
If you’ve received one of these texts, don’t panic! According to the Army, there is no active draft in place. The last draft in the United States ended in 1973, and since then, the military has been an all-volunteer force. While there have been discussions about the possibility of a new draft in the future, as of now, there is no reason to believe that one is imminent.
The Army has gone on record to state that these fake text messages are not only inaccurate but potentially harmful. They advise recipients not to respond to the text or click on any links contained within it. If you receive such a message, the best course of action is to delete it and move on with your day.
It’s not entirely clear who is behind these fake messages, but it’s likely that they’re the work of pranksters or scammers looking to stir up trouble. However, the fact that they’ve gained so much traction is a testament to just how nervous people are about the possibility of a new military conflict.
In conclusion, if you’ve received a text message claiming that you’ve been drafted into the Army, take a deep breath and relax. These messages are completely fake, and there is no need to panic. Instead, simply delete the message and move on with your day. The odds of a new draft being implemented are slim, and there is no need to worry about it until or unless it becomes a reality.
