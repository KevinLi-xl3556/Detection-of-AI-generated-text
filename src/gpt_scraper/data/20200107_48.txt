After receiving hundreds of original and personal narratives from writers all around the world, we are excited to announce the winners of our personal narrative essay contest.
First place goes to Sarah Johnson with her essay “Finding Beauty in the Struggle.” Sarah’s essay moved us with her honest and vulnerable account of overcoming her struggles with anxiety and depression. Her vivid descriptions and beautiful language allowed us to see the world through her eyes and empathize with her journey towards healing.
Second place goes to Mark Rodriguez with his essay “The Last Sunset.” Mark’s essay took us on a journey through his greatest loss - the passing of his father. His raw emotions and honest portrayal of grief touched our hearts and left a lasting impression. Mark’s poignant descriptions of his father’s love for the outdoors and the memories they shared painted a beautiful picture of their relationship.
Third place goes to Maria Gomez with her essay “My Grandmother’s Hands.” Maria’s essay was a tribute to her beloved grandmother - someone who taught her the importance of hard work, determination, and love. Her touching anecdotes and beautiful descriptions of her grandmother’s hands - worn and weathered from years of hard work - showcased the important role her grandmother played in shaping her life.
Honorable mention goes to John Lee with his essay “Lessons from a Street Performer.” John’s essay recounted his encounter with a street performer and the valuable life lessons he learned from the moment. His essay’s beautiful imagery and clever use of metaphor proved that inspiration can come from anywhere and that often the most profound lessons can be found in the most unlikely of places.
