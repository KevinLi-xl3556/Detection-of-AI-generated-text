As the United States gears up for another presidential election, it is crucial to consider the qualities that we want in our Commander-in-Chief. In 2016, America made a grave mistake by electing Donald Trump, a man who has proven time and time again that he is unfit to lead our country. With the 2020 election on the horizon, it is imperative that we understand why we can’t afford to have Trump as our Commander-in-Chief for another four years.
First and foremost, Trump has shown a disregard for the rule of law. Throughout his presidency, he has repeatedly attacked the independence of the judiciary, belittled law enforcement, and ignored the constitutional checks and balances that are designed to protect our democracy. He has shown a willingness to use the power of his office to punish his political opponents, and has shown little respect for the principles that underpin our justice system.
Secondly, Trump has demonstrated a reckless disregard for national security. He has insulted our allies, cozyed up to dictators, and undermined the institutions that are meant to protect our country. He has shown a willingness to sacrifice national security for his own personal gain, as evidenced by his attempts to pressure foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. His erratic behavior has also put our military personnel in harm’s way, with his impulsive decision-making leading to hasty withdrawals from conflict zones and dangerous escalations with foreign adversaries.
Thirdly, Trump has proven himself to be a divisive and polarizing figure. Instead of working to unite our country, he has stoked the flames of division and hatred. He has used racist and xenophobic rhetoric to appeal to his base, and has shown little interest in addressing the systemic injustices that plague our society. His lack of empathy and compassion has made it clear that he is not interested in being a leader for all Americans, but rather only for those who support him.
Lastly, Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle crises. From the COVID-19 pandemic to the recent civil unrest, he has shown a lack of leadership and a failure to respond effectively to emergencies. He has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the pandemic, refused to take necessary steps to protect American lives, and has even suggested unproven treatments that could put people’s lives at risk. His response to the recent protests has been equally inept, with his tweets and actions only serving to further inflame tensions and divide our country.
In conclusion, it is clear that we can’t afford to have Trump as our Commander-in-Chief for another four years. His disregard for the rule of law, national security, and the unity of our country, combined with his inability to handle crises, make him unfit to lead America. It is up to each and every one of us to ensure that we elect a leader who will unite our country, uphold our democratic values, and protect the American people.
