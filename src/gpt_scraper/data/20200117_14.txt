Robert Ray Wanted to Indict Clinton. He Thinks Trump Will Be Vindicated.
Robert Ray, the former independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton’s Whitewater scandal, has recently been making headlines with his thoughts on the current impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. In a recent interview with Fox News, Ray expressed his belief that President Trump will ultimately be vindicated.
It’s no secret that Ray is no fan of the Democratic Party. Back in the late 90s, he served as the successor to Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel charged with investigating Clinton. Ray’s investigation ultimately led to Clinton’s impeachment, although he was ultimately acquitted in the Senate.
Now, as the House of Representatives continues their impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Ray is once again making his opinions known. In his interview with Fox News, Ray blasted the ongoing inquiry as a “political exercise” and expressed his belief that the president will ultimately be vindicated.
While it’s not entirely clear how Ray arrived at this conclusion, it seems to be rooted in his faith in the legal system. In his interview, Ray suggested that the “majority of Americans believe in the rule of law,” and implied that any impeachment proceedings that did not ultimately result in the president’s removal from office would be a victory for Trump.
Of course, not everyone agrees with Ray’s assessment. Many Democrats have argued that the ongoing inquiry is a necessary step in upholding the rule of law, and have called for Trump’s impeachment and removal from office. Meanwhile, some Republicans have argued that the inquiry is a partisan attack on the president, and have defended Trump’s actions as appropriate.
Regardless of how the inquiry ultimately plays out, it’s clear that Robert Ray will be keeping a close eye on the proceedings. As a former independent counsel who has already played a major role in a presidential impeachment, his thoughts and opinions carry significant weight. Whether or not his prediction of a Trump vindication ultimately comes to pass remains to be seen, but it’s a safe bet that Ray will not shy away from sharing his thoughts along the way.
