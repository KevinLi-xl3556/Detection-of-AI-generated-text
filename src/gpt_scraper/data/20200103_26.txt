The assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the United States in January 2020 was a significant event that made headlines across the world. The killing of Soleimani, who was a revered figure in Iran and had played a crucial role in shaping Iran’s foreign policy and military strategy, was seen as a significant blow to the Islamic Republic. However, almost two years after his death, it is evident that Soleimani’s death has changed little for Iran.
First and foremost, Soleimani’s death did not lead to a significant shift in Iran’s foreign policy or military strategy. Iran’s policies and goals remain largely unchanged, and the country has continued to pursue its interests in the region, including supporting militias in Iraq and Syria and backing Houthi rebels in Yemen. The assassination of Soleimani did not weaken Iran’s military capabilities or deter the country from pursuing its regional ambitions.
Moreover, the killing of Soleimani had the opposite effect of what the United States intended. It served to unite the Iranian people and rally them around the government. Soleimani was viewed as a national hero and his death was widely seen as an act of aggression by the United States. The Iranian government was quick to exploit this sentiment, using it to strengthen its own position and justify its actions.
The United States’ decision to assassinate Soleimani also had a broader impact on regional stability. The killing raised tensions between the United States and Iran to an unprecedented level and led to a series of retaliatory attacks and counterattacks. The downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by Iranian forces in January 2020, which killed all 176 people on board, was a tragic consequence of the heightened tensions between the two countries.
Despite the significant media attention and political fallout surrounding Soleimani’s death, Iran has remained largely unaffected by the assassination. The country’s leadership remains intact, its military capabilities have not been diminished, and its regional ambitions remain unchanged. The United States, on the other hand, has suffered a blow to its reputation and credibility in the region, while also failing to achieve its goals of weakening Iran’s position.
In conclusion, while the killing of Qasem Soleimani was a significant event that caused widespread speculation about its potential impact on Iran’s foreign policy and military strategy, it is now clear that the assassination changed very little for Iran. The country’s leadership and military capabilities remain intact, and its regional ambitions continue to guide its actions. Meanwhile, the United States has suffered a blow to its reputation and credibility, while failing to achieve its objectives in the region.
