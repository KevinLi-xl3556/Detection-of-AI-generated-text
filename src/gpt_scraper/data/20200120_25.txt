Serbia-Kosovo Flights to Resume Under U.S.-Brokered Deal
In a historic agreement brokered by the United States on 4th September 2020, Serbia and Kosovo agreed to resume direct commercial flights for the first time in 21 years. This move comes as a significant step in normalizing relations between the two countries, which have been filled with tension and conflict since the Kosovo War in 1999.
The agreement was signed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti, and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations, Richard Grenell, in the Oval Office at the White House with the participation of American President Donald Trump. This deal was considered a milestone, as both Serbia and Kosovo agreed to make real efforts to improve their relationship and cooperate on several crucial issues, including transport and infrastructure, energy, and economic cooperation.
The resumption of flights between Kosovo and Serbia is seen as a significant development, which is expected to attract more investors, boost tourism, and enhance intercultural exchange, leading to an improvement in the relationship between the neighboring countries. Previously, Serbia refused to allow flights to land at its airports from Kosovo, which had forced Kosovar passengers to take longer, more expensive flights via other countries
In the joint statement, the government of the Republic of Serbia and the government of the Republic of Kosovo recognized that air transport links play an essential role in the wider communication and economic development of the region. The two countries have agreed to work together to establish a direct flight between Belgrade and Pristina, after finalizing technical details with the support of the European Union.
President Vucic hailed the agreement as a significant step in promoting peace and stability in the region, which he said would have economic benefits for both Kosovars and Serbs. Moreover, Kosovo’s Prime Minister, Mr. Hoti, acknowledged that the agreement would mark a significant milestone for Kosovo, promising to create new opportunities for economic growth and regional cooperation.
The U.S.-brokered deal has received widespread support and appreciation from international leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump praised the agreement as a “major breakthrough for peace and economic ties.” Moreover, German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the deal as a “critical step forward” and said it showed that a normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo is possible. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also commended the agreement and said it would be a “positive step” in EU-facilitated dialogue.
In conclusion, the resumption of flights between Serbia and Kosovo is indeed a step towards building a peaceful and mutually beneficial relationship between the two nations. This historic agreement also highlights the role of international mediation in resolving long-standing disputes, paving the way for regional cooperation and economic growth. The normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo is a crucial prerequisite for their eventual integration into the European Union.
