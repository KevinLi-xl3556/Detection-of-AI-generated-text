The targeted killing of Qassim Suleimani, a high-ranking Iranian general, has sparked controversy and raised concerns over the legality of such actions. Many argue that the killing was illegal, while others argue that it was a necessary measure to protect American interests. However, regardless of one’s stance on the issue, there is no denying that it was predictable.
Suleimani was considered to be one of Iran’s most powerful figures and had allegedly orchestrated attacks against American forces in the region. On January 3, 2020, he was killed in a targeted drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump. The killing was hailed by some as a victory for America in its ongoing conflict with Iran, but it also raised questions over the legality of such actions.
Under international law, targeted killings are only legal in certain circumstances. The use of force must be necessary and proportionate, and it must be carried out in self-defense or with the authorization of the United Nations Security Council. In this case, neither condition was met. The attack was carried out without the authorization of the UN Security Council, and it could not be said to be in self-defense as there was no imminent threat to American lives.
Furthermore, the killing of Suleimani was not an isolated incident but part of a wider trend of targeted killings carried out by the United States military. This has become known as the “war on terror,” which began in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The use of drone strikes and targeted killings has become a central part of America’s foreign policy, and the killing of Suleimani was just one example of this.
Given the history of American use of targeted killings, it was predictable that something like this would happen eventually. However, this does not make it legal. International law must be upheld, even in cases where the use of force may seem necessary. The United States must be held accountable for its actions, and the killing of Suleimani must be thoroughly investigated to determine whether it was legal under international law.
In conclusion, the killing of Qassim Suleimani was both illegal and predictable. The United States must be held accountable for its actions and must ensure that international law is upheld in all circumstances. The use of targeted killings as part of America’s foreign policy must also be examined and questioned to ensure that it is in line with international law and that the use of force is truly necessary and proportionate.
