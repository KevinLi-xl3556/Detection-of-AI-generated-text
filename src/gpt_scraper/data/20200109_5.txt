Former Fox News anchor, Megyn Kelly, has recently released a YouTube video in which she talks about her experiences working with Roger Ailes and the making of the film ‘Bombshell’, which portrays the sexual harassment allegations against Ailes.
In the video titled ‘The truth about the movie “Bombshell”’, Kelly reveals that she was initially skeptical about the film but ultimately decided to support it. She explained that although the film was not entirely accurate, it did capture the essence of the toxic environment at Fox News and the experiences of the women who were harassed by Ailes.
Kelly, who herself accused Ailes of sexual harassment, described the process of filming ‘Bombshell’ as cathartic and emotional, and praised the performances of Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie, who played Kelly and fellow Fox News anchors Gretchen Carlson and Kayla Pospisil, respectively.
The former anchor also spoke about her complicated relationship with Ailes, who she described as a mentor and father figure who she trusted and relied on for support. However, she acknowledged that the allegations against him were true and that she believed the women who came forward.
Kelly’s video has sparked renewed interest in the controversy surrounding Ailes, who was forced to resign from Fox News in 2016 following a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Carlson. Many have praised Kelly for speaking candidly about her experiences and for standing up for the women who were affected by Ailes’ behavior.
Overall, Kelly’s video serves as a reminder of the importance of speaking truth to power and advocating for those who have been wronged. Despite the backlash she has faced, Kelly has remained steadfast in her commitment to exposing the truth and creating a safer and more just workplace for all women.
