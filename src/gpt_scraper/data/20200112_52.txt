In the wake of the Iraq War, many soldiers returned home with life-changing injuries. Some were left paralyzed, others lost limbs. One of these soldiers, Brian Mast, lost both of his legs while serving in Iraq. But instead of simply accepting his fate, Mast decided to take action. He sued the government of Iran, claiming that the country had provided support to the insurgents who were responsible for his injuries.
Mast’s story begins in 2010, when he was serving as a bomb disposal expert with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. One day, while he was working to clear a building of explosives, a bomb detonated, causing him to lose both of his legs and his index finger. After being flown to a hospital in Germany, Mast was eventually transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland.
It was during his time at Walter Reed that Mast began to consider taking legal action against Iran. He learned that many of the explosives used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan were manufactured in Iran and then smuggled across the border. He also discovered that Iran had provided training and other forms of support to insurgents in both countries.
Mast filed a lawsuit against Iran in 2012, seeking compensation for his injuries. The case was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which allows U.S. citizens to sue foreign governments for acts of terrorism. Mast argued that Iran had provided material support to the insurgents who had planted the bomb that caused his injuries, and that this support constituted an act of terrorism.
Iran, unsurprisingly, denied any involvement in Mast’s injuries. The country argued that the bomb that caused Mast’s injuries could have been manufactured by any number of groups, and that there was no evidence linking it to Iran. Iran also claimed that the lawsuit was politically motivated and that the U.S. courts had no jurisdiction in the matter.
Despite Iran’s protests, the case went to trial in 2016. Mast testified about his injuries and the impact they had on his life. He spoke about the physical pain he experiences every day, as well as the emotional toll of losing both of his legs. He also talked about his desire to hold Iran accountable for its role in the war.
In the end, the court ruled in Mast’s favor, awarding him $10.8 million in damages. The judge in the case found that Iran had provided material support to the insurgents who were responsible for Mast’s injuries, and that this support constituted an act of terrorism. The judge also ruled that the U.S. courts did have jurisdiction in the matter.
Mast’s case was not without controversy, however. Some critics argued that it set a dangerous precedent, allowing U.S. citizens to sue foreign governments for actions that occurred on foreign soil. Others argued that it was unfair to hold Iran responsible for the actions of a few insurgents.
Despite the controversy, Mast’s case highlights the impact that the Iraq War had on the lives of American soldiers. It also serves as a reminder of the complex legal and political issues that arise when U.S. citizens seek to hold foreign governments accountable for acts of terrorism. Whether or not Mast’s case sets a precedent remains to be seen, but it is clear that his story will continue to be an important part of the ongoing conversation about the war in Iraq and its aftermath.
