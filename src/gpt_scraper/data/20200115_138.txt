As the world watched the much-anticipated debate between two political rivals, the question that is on everyone’s mind is: Who won the debate? While opinions vary, experts in the field are weighing in with their analysis to help answer this question.
Firstly, it is important to note that there are different criteria for measuring a debate’s success, such as who was more skilled in rhetoric, who answered the questions more convincingly, or who managed to sway voters the most. However, for the purpose of simplicity, we will focus on the most commonly used method, which is who delivered stronger arguments on the topics discussed.
According to several political analysts, both candidates made strong arguments in some areas, but they also fell short in others. Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, was praised for his clear and concise approach in addressing topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. He also scored points for his emotional appeal when discussing social justice and race-related issues. However, he was criticized for his inability to provide a clear answer on topics such as healthcare reform and court packing.
On the other side, Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was praised for his decisive responses and his focus on economic issues such as jobs and tax cuts. He also made strong arguments on topics such as immigration, law and order, and foreign policy. However, his constant interrupting and attacking of the moderator and Biden were universally panned.
Overall, many experts believe that Joe Biden emerged as the winner of the debate, mainly due to his ability to stay composed and answer questions directly. It was noted, however, that there were no major game-changers in the debate, and both candidates reinforced their base supporters.
It is important to note that these are just opinions from experts and that the true winner of the debate will ultimately be determined by the voters on Election Day.
In conclusion, while the debate proved to be an intense and sometimes chaotic exchange, experts agree that Joe Biden came out on top. However, the debates are only one factor that will influence the outcome of the upcoming election, and it is yet to be seen how the American public will respond. One thing is certain: the world will be watching closely.
