On King Holiday, 2020 Democrats March Arm in Arm to Honor His Legacy
On January 20, 2020, the United States celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a national holiday honoring the civil rights leader’s legacy. It was also a pivotal day for the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, who took time out of their campaigns to pay tribute to King’s enduring impact on American society.
In a display of unity, several of the Democratic candidates marched arm in arm with civil rights activists and community leaders at various commemorative events across the country. They used the opportunity to reflect on King’s message of love, unity, and equality, and to call for a renewed commitment to his vision during this crucial election year.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar joined a march in her home state and delivered a passionate speech in which she invoked King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech and called for an end to the divisions that continue to plague the country. “We cannot go back. We cannot accept racism and bigotry and prejudice and hate as the norm. We have to be better than that,” Klobuchar said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has been a vocal advocate for civil rights throughout his career, attended a breakfast event in Wilmington, Delaware, where he spoke about King’s legacy and the challenges that still face the country. “We must carry forward the torch that he lit so brightly,” Biden said. “We must be the change we want to see.”
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has been a consistent advocate for economic and social justice, marched alongside King’s daughter, Bernice King, in Columbia, South Carolina. Sanders highlighted the need for a “political revolution” to achieve King’s vision of a more equitable society. “We need a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few,” Sanders said.
Other candidates, including Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang, also participated in King Day events, emphasizing the importance of King’s legacy and the need to continue his fight for justice and equality. The display of solidarity among the Democratic contenders offered a hopeful vision for the future of the country, one in which the values of love, unity, and equality remain at the forefront of American politics.
However, as the primary season heats up, it remains to be seen how successful the Democrats will be in converting their words into action. The country remains deeply divided, with tensions running high on issues like race, immigration, and income inequality. It will take more than applause lines and photo ops to achieve the kind of fundamental change that King envisioned.
As we mark another Martin Luther King Jr. Day and prepare for another presidential election, we must remember that King’s legacy is not only a source of inspiration, but also a call to action. We must continue to work towards his vision of a more just and equitable society, not just on January 20, but every day of the year. Only then can we truly honor his legacy and build a better future for generations to come.
