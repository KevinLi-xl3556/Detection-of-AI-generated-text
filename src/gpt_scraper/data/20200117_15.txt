As the debate over the future of the Secret Service continues, a new report suggests that returning the agency to the Treasury Department could have negative consequences for homeland security.
The Secret Service has been a part of the Department of Homeland Security since its creation in 2002, but there have been calls in recent years to return it to the Treasury Department, which oversaw the agency for many years prior to its transfer.
Supporters of the move argue that the Treasury Department has a better understanding of the Secret Service’s core mission of protecting the nation’s financial system, and that the agency would benefit from the Treasury’s expertise in areas such as financial intelligence and anti-money laundering.
However, opponents of the move have raised concerns that it could harm the Secret Service’s ability to carry out its broader mission of protecting the President, Vice President, and other high-ranking officials, as well as investigating financial crimes and cyber threats.
The new report, authored by a group of homeland security and law enforcement experts, argues that the Secret Service’s placement within the Department of Homeland Security has allowed it to better coordinate with other agencies involved in homeland security efforts, such as Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.
The report also notes that the Secret Service’s current structure allows it to draw on a wider range of expertise and resources than it would be able to as part of the Treasury Department, which has a more narrow focus on financial matters.
Proponents of returning the Secret Service to the Treasury Department have argued that the agency would still be able to work with other homeland security agencies and draw on their expertise, but the report suggests that this would be more difficult if the agency is no longer a part of the same department.
The report concludes that while there may be some benefits to returning the Secret Service to the Treasury Department, the potential risks to homeland security and the agency’s ability to carry out its full range of functions make this a risky proposition.
As policymakers and stakeholders continue to debate the future of the Secret Service, it will be important to carefully consider the implications of any changes and ensure that the agency is able to effectively carry out its mission of protecting the nation’s leaders and financial system.
