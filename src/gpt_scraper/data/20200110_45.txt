The Downed Ukrainian Airliner: Assessing Blame
On January 8th, 2020, a Ukrainian passenger plane carrying 176 people was shot down by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. The incident shook the world and sparked a wave of international condemnation.
As the world mourned the loss of innocent lives, questions were raised about who was responsible for the downing of the aircraft. Iran initially denied involvement and blamed the crash on a technical malfunction, but evidence soon emerged that contradicted this claim.
The Iranian government eventually admitted to shooting down the plane, stating that it had been mistaken for a hostile target in the midst of heightened tensions with the United States. The admission came after several days of protests within Iran, with citizens demanding answers and accountability.
But even with Iran’s admission, the question of who should bear the ultimate responsibility for the tragedy remains a matter of debate. Here are some of the key players and factors that contributed to the downing of the Ukrainian airliner.
Iran’s Military and Government
The IRGC is a powerful branch of Iran’s military and answers directly to the Supreme Leader. The unit’s missile defense system was responsible for shooting down the Ukrainian plane, and the decision to fire was made by a local commander who reportedly mistook the aircraft for a hostile target.
Iran’s government has faced criticism for its initial denial of involvement in the incident and for the way it handled the aftermath. The government’s delayed admission, coupled with a lack of transparency and accountability, has fueled anger and mistrust among both Iranians and the international community.
The United States
Tensions between the United States and Iran had been escalating for months prior to the downing of the Ukrainian plane. In early January, the U.S. carried out a drone strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, prompting retaliatory missile strikes from Iran.
Some have argued that the U.S.'s actions contributed to the tense atmosphere that led to the downing of the Ukrainian plane. Others have criticized the U.S. for not doing enough to prevent the tragedy or to hold Iran accountable for its actions.
Ukraine
The Ukrainian government has demanded compensation for the families of the victims and has called for a thorough investigation into the incident. Ukraine has also accused Iran of failing to cooperate fully with the investigation and has criticized the country’s handling of the aftermath.
International Aviation Authorities
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other aviation authorities have been involved in the investigation into the downing of the Ukrainian plane. These organizations have called for a full and transparent investigation and have urged Iran to cooperate fully with the process.
Assessing Blame
The downing of the Ukrainian plane was a tragic and avoidable incident that claimed the lives of 176 innocent people. While Iran has admitted responsibility, questions remain about who should bear ultimate blame for the tragedy.
Iran’s military and government were directly responsible for the shooting down of the plane, and the decision to fire was made by a local commander. The government’s initial denial and subsequent handling of the aftermath have also contributed to the anger and mistrust surrounding the incident.
However, the United States’ actions in the lead-up to the tragedy have also been criticized, with some arguing that the country’s policies and rhetoric contributed to the tense atmosphere that led to the downing of the plane.
Ultimately, a full and transparent investigation is necessary to determine the precise causes of the tragedy and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. The families of the victims and the international community deserve answers and justice, and it is incumbent upon all parties involved to work together to achieve these goals.
