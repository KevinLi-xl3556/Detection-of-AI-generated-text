In recent years, there has been a growing trend of referring to the current era of television as the “Golden Age of Television” or “Peak TV.” With the vast array of content options available to viewers today, it’s easy to see why this term has caught on. However, according to recent data, it appears that Peak TV has hit a new peak, with a record-breaking 532 scripted shows now available to viewers.
This figure comes from the annual report released by FX Networks’ research department, which tracks the number of scripted TV shows available each year. In 2019, the total number of shows available increased by 7%, rising from 495 shows in 2018 to 532 shows last year.
While it’s exciting to see such a variety of content available to viewers, some are beginning to wonder if we’ve reached a saturation point. With so many shows competing for viewers’ attention, it can be difficult for even the most entertaining and well-produced series to stand out from the crowd.
There are also concerns about the quality of the programs being produced. With so many shows being made each year, some industry insiders worry that networks and streaming platforms are rushing to produce content without taking the time to ensure it is of a high standard. This could ultimately result in a decrease in overall quality across the industry.
Despite these concerns, many continue to celebrate the abundance of scripted television available today. Some argue that the sheer volume of content means that there is something for everyone, no matter what their interests or preferences may be.
The rise of Peak TV has also had a significant impact on the entertainment industry as a whole. With so many shows being made, there is a greater demand for writers, directors, actors, and other creatives. This has opened up new opportunities for those looking to break into the industry, as well as created more competition for established players.
Overall, it appears that Peak TV shows no signs of slowing down. As long as there is an audience seeking out new and interesting content, it’s likely that we’ll continue to see an increase in the number of scripted shows being produced each year. Whether this trend will ultimately be sustainable, however, remains to be seen.
