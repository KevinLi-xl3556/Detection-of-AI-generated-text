Seattle Takes On Citizens United
Seattle, known for its progressive stance on various social and political issues, is once again leading the charge in a groundbreaking effort to challenge the controversial Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a landmark ruling in 2010, granted corporations and unions the same First Amendment rights as individuals, allowing them to spend unlimited money in support of political candidates or issues. Seattle, however, has taken a bold step to challenge this decision and restore power to the hands of its citizens.
In January 2023, the Seattle City Council unanimously passed a resolution declaring its opposition to the Citizens United decision and calling for a city-wide referendum to be held in the upcoming November election. The referendum, known as the “Seattle Democracy Voucher Program,” aims to create a publicly funded campaign finance system that would empower ordinary citizens and reduce the influence of big money in local elections.
Under the proposed program, eligible Seattle residents would receive four $25 “democracy vouchers” that they could donate to candidates running for city council or city attorney. These vouchers would be publicly funded by a dedicated property tax and would be distributed to registered voters and residents who are at least 18 years old, U.S. citizens, and living in Seattle. Candidates who choose to participate in the program would agree to strict campaign spending limits and would only be allowed to accept contributions from individual donors of up to $250, with no corporate or union contributions allowed.
The Seattle Democracy Voucher Program is designed to level the playing field for candidates and reduce the influence of wealthy donors and special interest groups in local elections. It aims to make politics more accessible to ordinary citizens who may not have the financial means to donate large sums of money to candidates. The program also seeks to increase transparency and accountability in campaign finance by requiring candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures and by establishing an independent commission to oversee and enforce the program’s rules.
Seattle’s efforts to challenge Citizens United have garnered support from various advocacy groups, including Democracy Voucher Now, a grassroots organization that has been leading the charge for campaign finance reform in the city. Proponents of the program argue that it will help curb the undue influence of money in politics, promote fairness and transparency, and encourage broader participation in the democratic process.
However, there are also critics of the program who argue that it infringes on free speech rights and unfairly restricts the ability of candidates to raise funds for their campaigns. Some opponents have also expressed concerns about the potential for abuse and fraud in the voucher system, as well as the cost of implementing and administering the program.
Despite the challenges and debates surrounding the program, Seattle’s efforts to challenge Citizens United have gained national attention and could potentially set a precedent for other cities and states to follow. In a political landscape where the role of money in politics continues to be a contentious issue, Seattle’s bold move to take on Citizens United is a significant step towards reclaiming democracy for the people.
As the November election approaches, all eyes will be on Seattle to see the outcome of the referendum and the potential impact of the Seattle Democracy Voucher Program. Regardless of the outcome, Seattle’s determination to challenge the status quo and empower its citizens in the face of the Citizens United decision is a testament to the city’s progressive spirit and commitment to democracy. It serves as a beacon of hope for those who believe in the power of ordinary citizens to shape the political landscape and hold elected officials accountable to the will of the people.
