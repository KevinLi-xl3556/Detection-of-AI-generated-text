Around the Country in 17 Hours With Michael Bloomberg
Michael Bloomberg is one of the most prominent figures in American politics and business. He was the mayor of New York City for 12 years and the founder of Bloomberg LP, a financial data and media company. He has also run for president twice, in 2020 and 2024, and is known for his moderate politics and philanthropy.
Recently, I had the opportunity to join Mr. Bloomberg on a whirlwind tour of the country, where he was attending a series of events to promote his latest book, “Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet.” The trip was an intense 17-hour journey, but it was an unforgettable experience that gave me a unique insight into Mr. Bloomberg’s life and work.
We started our journey early in the morning, boarding a private jet at a small airport in New Jersey. Mr. Bloomberg was dressed in a suit and tie, and he was already deep into his day’s work, reading emails on his phone and going over his schedule for the day. I was struck by his focused and disciplined demeanor, as well as his deep knowledge of the issues he was working on.
Our first stop was a coffee shop in downtown Detroit, where Mr. Bloomberg met with a group of young entrepreneurs who were working on sustainable energy projects in the city. He listened attentively as they discussed their ideas and challenges, and offered practical advice and encouragement.
From there, we flew to Denver, where Mr. Bloomberg gave a keynote speech at a conference on climate change. He spoke passionately about the urgent need to address the issue, and the role that cities, businesses, and citizens could play in driving change. His speech was met with enthusiastic applause, and he took questions from the audience for nearly an hour.
After the conference, we hopped back on the plane and headed to Phoenix, where Mr. Bloomberg was scheduled to meet with the mayor and local business leaders to discuss a range of issues, from infrastructure to education. The meeting was intense and productive, with both sides exchanging ideas and suggestions for how to improve the city’s economy and quality of life.
Our final stop was San Francisco, where Mr. Bloomberg was scheduled to speak at a fundraiser for a local environmental nonprofit. The event was attended by a who’s who of Silicon Valley tech leaders, and Mr. Bloomberg’s speech was a call to action for the industry to do more to combat climate change. He also announced a significant donation to the nonprofit, which was met with cheers and applause.
After the fundraiser, we headed back to the airport, exhausted but exhilarated by the day’s events. As we flew back to New Jersey, Mr. Bloomberg took some time to reflect on the trip and the issues that had been discussed. He spoke about the importance of collaboration and partnership in driving change, and the need for leaders to be bold and visionary in their approach.
Overall, the trip was a testament to Mr. Bloomberg’s energy, dedication, and commitment to making a difference in the world. It was a reminder that, despite the many challenges we face, there are still people who are working tirelessly to build a better future for us all.
