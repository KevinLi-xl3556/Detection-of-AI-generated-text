Hong Kong is a place of diversity, both in its population and its businesses. But the recent protests and political turmoil have forced many companies to choose sides, and the choice between yellow or blue can have serious implications.
The yellow vs. blue divide refers to the two main political factions in Hong Kong - the pro-democracy “yellow” camp, and the pro-China “blue” camp. The divide has become increasingly sharp since the start of the 2019 anti-government protests, which saw millions take to the streets to demand democratic reforms and greater autonomy from China.
As the protests raged on, businesses found themselves caught in the middle. Some companies, particularly those with strong ties to China, publicly condemned the protesters and expressed support for the government’s crackdown. These companies were dubbed “blue businesses” by their critics.
On the other side were companies who sympathized with the protesters and their demands. These companies were dubbed “yellow businesses”, and many of them publicly expressed support for the pro-democracy movement.
The choice to publicly support one side or the other was not an easy one for many companies. On the one hand, taking a pro-China stance could alienate pro-democracy customers and employees, and could even lead to boycotts and protests against the company. On the other hand, taking a pro-democracy stance could result in backlash from the Chinese government, which has been known to punish companies who are seen as disloyal.
Despite the risks, many companies felt compelled to take a stand. Some did so out of a sense of moral obligation, while others saw an opportunity to tap into the growing market of pro-democracy consumers.
For example, in July 2019, the Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific found itself in hot water after some of its employees participated in the protests. In response, the company fired several employees and issued a statement in support of the government’s actions. This led to a widespread backlash, with many customers and employees calling for a boycott of the airline.
In contrast, other companies have embraced their pro-democracy stance. For example, the chain of restaurants Cafe de Coral announced in 2019 that it would offer free meals to anyone who had been arrested or injured during the protests. This move was widely applauded by pro-democracy consumers, and helped to boost the chain’s image as a socially responsible company.
The choice between yellow or blue has not just affected individual companies, but entire industries as well. For example, the Hong Kong film industry has been rocked by the protests - some films that were critical of China were banned, and some actors and directors who expressed pro-democracy views have faced professional repercussions.
Overall, the political divide in Hong Kong has had a profound impact on the business community. While some companies have managed to navigate the issue with little controversy, others have found themselves in the midst of a political firestorm. As the protests and political turmoil continue, it is likely that more companies will be forced to choose between yellow or blue - and the implications of that choice will be felt throughout Hong Kong and beyond.
