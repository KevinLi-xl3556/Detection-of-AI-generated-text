In the late 1800s, the western region of the United States was still largely uncharted territory. There were many intrepid explorers who set out to map the region, but one man stands out as the most influential: John Wesley Powell. Powell is famous for his exploration of the Grand Canyon and his efforts to map the region surrounding it. However, what many people don’t know is that Powell’s success was in large part due to his wife, Emma Dean Powell.
Emma Dean Powell was a highly educated woman for her time, having earned a degree in music from Illinois State University. She met John Wesley Powell while he was still a soldier fighting in the Civil War, and the two got married shortly after. When Powell returned from the war, he was determined to become an explorer and mapmaker, despite his lack of formal education in these areas.
Emma Dean Powell, however, was up to the challenge of helping her husband achieve his goals. She was an excellent writer and helped Powell document their travels in the west. Additionally, she was an accomplished artist and created sketches of the landscapes they encountered. Together, the Powells were able to create highly detailed maps of the western region of the United States, which were crucial for the expansion of the country.
However, it wasn’t until Emma Dean Powell wrote a book about their travels, entitled “A Canyon Voyage,” that the Powells gained widespread fame. The book was highly successful and brought national attention to the Powells’ work. It also helped to promote the idea of conservation and preservation of natural areas, as Emma Dean Powell described the beauty of the landscapes they encountered and the importance of preserving them for future generations.
Unfortunately, John Wesley Powell’s health began to deteriorate after their travels, and Emma Dean Powell was forced to become the primary breadwinner for their family. She worked as a reporter and editor for several newspapers and continued to write and speak about the importance of conservation. She also continued to be involved in her husband’s work, even after his death in 1902.
Today, John Wesley Powell is celebrated as one of the greatest explorers and mapmakers of the American west. However, it is important to remember that his success was due in large part to the support and contributions of his wife, Emma Dean Powell. Together, they accomplished great things and left behind an enduring legacy of exploration and conservation.
