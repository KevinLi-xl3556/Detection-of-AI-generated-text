If you’re a fan of avocado toast and Yemeni cuisine, you’re in luck. In many cities across the United States, you can find cafes and restaurants where these seemingly disparate foods share a menu.
This trend isn’t surprising, given the rise of fusion cuisine and the increasing interest in global flavors. Yemeni cuisine, in particular, has gained attention in recent years for its unique spices and flavors, as well as its emphasis on communal eating.
One example of a cafe where avocado toast and Yemeni favorites coexist is The Yemeni Coffee and Tea House in New York City. Here, you can enjoy a cup of Yemeni coffee or tea, along with dishes like foul (a fava bean dip), zahawiq (a spicy tomato and chili sauce), and of course, avocado toast.
Similarly, in Los Angeles, you can find cafes like Shibam Yemeni Cuisine and Cafe, which serves traditional Yemeni dishes like mandi (slow-cooked meat and rice), as well as avocado toast with za’atar (a Middle Eastern spice blend).
But what exactly makes Yemeni cuisine so special? For one, it’s a cuisine that has been shaped by its location at the crossroads of trade routes, with influences from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Yemeni cuisine also emphasizes the use of spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric, as well as the incorporation of flatbreads and stews.
Perhaps most notably, Yemeni cuisine is known for its tradition of communal eating. In Yemen, it’s common for groups of people to share a large platter of food, scooping up bites with flatbread or using their hands. This emphasis on sharing and hospitality is reflected in the generous portions and communal atmosphere of Yemeni restaurants.
So if you’re looking to expand your culinary horizons and try something new, why not give Yemeni cuisine a chance? And if you’re already a fan of avocado toast, why not try it with a side of zahawiq or a cup of Yemeni coffee? Who knows, you might just discover a new favorite dish.
