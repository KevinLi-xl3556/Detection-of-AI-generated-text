The US Department of Labor (DOL) has recently proposed a new rule aimed at limiting lawsuits against franchisors by franchise workers. The proposed rule, which was published in the Federal Register in early April, would provide a clear definition of when a franchisor can be considered a joint employer of franchise workers.
The issue of joint employment has been a contentious one in the franchise industry for years. Franchise workers often claim that they should be considered employees of both the franchisee and the franchisor, which would make the franchisor liable for any labor law violations committed by the franchisee. This has led to a wave of lawsuits against franchisors in recent years, with some claiming that the franchisor’s control over the franchisee’s business practices was sufficient to establish a joint employment relationship.
The proposed DOL rule seeks to provide clarity on this issue by setting forth a four-factor test to determine when a franchisor should be considered a joint employer of franchise workers. The factors include whether the franchisor:

Has the power to hire or fire franchise workers
Supervises and controls franchise workers’ work schedules or conditions of employment to a substantial degree
Determines franchise workers’ rates and methods of payment
Maintains franchise workers’ employment records

If a franchisor meets all four factors, they can be considered a joint employer of franchise workers and held liable for any labor law violations committed by the franchisee.
The proposed rule has been met with mixed reactions from the franchising industry. Some franchisors have applauded the rule, saying that it provides much-needed clarity on the issue of joint employment and will help to limit frivolous lawsuits against franchisors. Others, however, have criticized the rule, arguing that it will limit their ability to provide support and guidance to franchisees and may discourage franchisors from expanding their businesses.
Supporters of the proposed rule argue that it strikes a balance between protecting franchise workers and ensuring that franchisors are not held liable for every labor law violation committed by their franchisees. They also note that the rule is consistent with recent court decisions, including the National Labor Relations Board’s decision in Browning-Ferris Industries, which held that a company can be considered a joint employer if it exercises indirect control over workers.
Opponents of the rule, on the other hand, argue that it will lead to increased litigation and uncertainty in the franchising industry. They also argue that the rule is unnecessary, as the issue of joint employment is already well-established in labor law and can be addressed through individual lawsuits and agency enforcement actions.
The proposed DOL rule is currently open for public comment, and it remains to be seen how the agency will respond to the feedback it receives. Regardless of the final outcome, however, the issue of joint employment in the franchise industry is likely to remain a contentious one for years to come.
