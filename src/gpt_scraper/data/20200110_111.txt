As the United States gears up for the 2020 presidential election, one thing is certain: Latino voters will play a crucial role in deciding the outcome. With the Latino population now the largest minority group in the country, their impact on the election cannot be overstated. In this article, we will explore why Latino voters are so important, what issues matter to them, and what both major political parties are doing to court their support.
The Latino Vote
The Latino vote has been growing steadily in recent years, and is expected to continue to do so in 2020. According to the Pew Research Center, Latinos are projected to account for 13.3% of eligible voters, up from 11.9% in 2016. This increase in the Latino vote could be especially significant in key battleground states like Florida, Arizona, and Texas, where Latinos make up a significant portion of the electorate.
What Matters to Latino Voters
Like all voters, Latino voters care about a wide range of issues, but there are some that are particularly important to them. One of the most pressing issues for many Latinos is immigration. According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center, 75% of Latino voters said that creating a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants is either the most important or a very important issue for them. Other important issues for Latino voters include healthcare, jobs and the economy, education, and climate change.
Political Parties and the Latino Vote
Both major political parties recognize the importance of the Latino vote, and are actively working to court their support. The Democratic Party has traditionally been seen as more supportive of immigration reform and other issues important to Latinos, and this remains true in 2020. Democratic candidates have been vocal in their support for the Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, and many have called for a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants.
The Republican Party, meanwhile, has been working to make inroads with Latino voters in recent years. In 2016, President Trump won 28% of the Latino vote, and the party is hoping to build on that in 2020. To that end, Republican candidates have been highlighting issues that they believe are important to Latinos, such as job creation and economic growth.
Conclusion
The Latino vote will play a crucial role in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. With their growing numbers and concentration in key battleground states, Latinos have the potential to swing the election one way or the other. Both major political parties are aware of the importance of the Latino vote, and are working hard to court their support. Ultimately, the party that is able to win over Latino voters on the issues that matter to them is the one that will come out on top in 2020.
