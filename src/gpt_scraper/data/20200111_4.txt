Michael Bloomberg, the former Mayor of New York City, has reportedly declared that he is open to spending one billion dollars of his own money to defeat President Donald Trump in the upcoming 2020 election.
This news comes after Bloomberg had initially declared that he wouldn’t run for president himself, but instead would focus on supporting Democratic candidates running for various offices throughout the country.
Bloomberg has been a vocal critic of Trump, calling him a “con man” and a “dangerous demagogue”. He has also been an advocate for gun control, climate change action, and other progressive policies.
In 2018, Bloomberg reportedly spent over $100 million to support Democratic candidates in the mid-term elections, which helped the party take control of the House of Representatives.
Bloomberg’s potential campaign team is currently reaching out to various fundraising organizations and donors to gauge their support, and some wealthy donors have reportedly already pledged support.
Bloomberg’s potential campaign could shake up the Democratic primary race, as he would be entering the fray as a billionaire with vast resources to pour into the race. However, it’s still unclear how Bloomberg, who is considered to be more moderate, would appeal to the progressive wing of the party.
Some Democrats have expressed concerns that Bloomberg’s spending might create the impression that democracy is for sale to the highest bidder. However, Bloomberg has argued that he will be using his money to fight against the corrupting influence of big money in politics, rather than contributing to it.
Ultimately, Bloomberg’s decision to spend one billion dollars on defeating Trump is a bold move that could potentially change the trajectory of the 2020 election. It remains to be seen how effective his strategy will be and whether it will be enough to sway voters in the Democratic primary and beyond.
