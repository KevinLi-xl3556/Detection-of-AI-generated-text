Egil Krogh, 80, Nixon Aide, Dies; Authorized an Infamous Break-In
Egil Krogh, a former aide to United States President Richard Nixon, passed away at the age of 80. Krogh gained notoriety for authorizing the break-in of the Watergate complex in 1971, which later led to Nixon’s eventual resignation in 1974.
Krogh was born in 1939 in Tacoma, Washington. He attended the University of Washington, where he earned a law degree in 1964. After law school, Krogh worked for the FBI and served in the US Army before joining the Nixon Administration in 1969.
In the White House, Krogh headed the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which was later renamed the Drug Enforcement Administration. He was known for his innovative and nontraditional approach to fighting drug abuse and addiction.
However, Krogh’s legacy would be forever tied to his authorization of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in 1971. Krogh authorized the break-in, which was intended to gather information on Nixon’s political opponents. The break-in was discovered, and Krogh, along with others involved, was convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and illegal wiretapping.
Krogh served four-and-a-half months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. After his release, he returned to the Pacific Northwest, where he worked as an attorney and an environmental activist.
In his later years, Krogh expressed remorse for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. He became an advocate for government ethics and spoke out against the abuse of power.
Krogh’s passing marks the end of an era in American politics. His role in the Watergate scandal will forever be a part of American history, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability.
Despite his flawed legacy, Egil Krogh will always be remembered as a complex and multifaceted figure in American politics, one whose actions will continue to be scrutinized and debated for years to come.
