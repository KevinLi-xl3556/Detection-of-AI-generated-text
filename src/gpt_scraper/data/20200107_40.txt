In a surprising move, the Romance Writers of America (RWA) has announced the cancellation of their annual awards program. The RWA is a professional organization for writers of romantic fiction, and their awards program has been a highly anticipated event in the industry for many years.
The decision to cancel the awards program was made after a tumultuous year for the organization. In 2019, the RWA faced backlash over their handling of allegations of racism and discrimination against one of their members, Courtney Milan. Milan, a bestselling author and outspoken advocate for diversity in the genre, had been critical of a fellow member’s book, which she felt contained racist content. In response, the RWA censured Milan, sparking widespread outrage among members and prompting a wave of resignations from the organization.
In the months that followed, the RWA underwent significant leadership changes and implemented new policies aimed at addressing issues of diversity and inclusivity within the organization. However, these efforts were not enough to save the awards program, which had become a lightning rod for controversy in the wake of the Milan scandal.
In a statement announcing the cancellation of the awards, RWA President LaQuette said, “After much consideration, the RWA Board has made the difficult decision to cancel the RITA contest. This contest has been a hallmark of RWA for over three decades, and we understand how important it has been to so many authors and readers in our community. However, the contest no longer represents the best of RWA and the romance genre. RWA remains committed to celebrating excellence in romance writing, but we believe it’s time to move forward with a new, more inclusive awards program that better reflects our values and the diversity of our community.”
The decision to cancel the awards program has been met with mixed reactions within the romance community. Some authors and readers are disappointed to see the RITA contest go, while others see it as a necessary step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable organization. Many are now eagerly anticipating what the RWA will come up with to replace the RITA contest.
Regardless of the outcome, the cancellation of the RITA contest marks a significant turning point for the RWA and the romance genre as a whole. As the industry continues to grapple with issues of diversity, representation, and inclusivity, it’s clear that change is happening – and the RWA is no exception. While the road ahead may be challenging, the cancellation of the RITA contest serves as a reminder that the romance community is committed to creating a better, more inclusive future for everyone.
