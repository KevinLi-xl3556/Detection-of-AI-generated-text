David Stern, the former commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), is widely regarded as one of the most transformative figures in the league’s history. During his tenure, which spanned from 1984 to 2014, Stern oversaw the league’s globalization, expansion, and immense popularity. However, one of his most significant contributions was his handling of race in the NBA.
The NBA has long been a predominantly African American league, and Stern recognized early on that the league’s success was inextricably tied to its ability to appeal to a diverse audience. In the early 1980s, the NBA faced a number of challenges related to race, including declining attendance and the perception that the league was too “black.” Stern recognized that addressing these issues would be critical to the NBA’s success, and he set out to make significant changes.
One of Stern’s first moves was to promote diversity within the league’s front offices. He encouraged teams to hire more women and people of color, and he worked to create programs that would help train and develop future NBA executives. This focus on diversity not only helped the league become more inclusive but also helped to create a more vibrant and dynamic NBA culture.
Another key element of Stern’s approach to race in the NBA was his emphasis on player empowerment. During his tenure, Stern worked to give players a greater voice in league decisions, and he encouraged them to use their platforms to advocate for social justice causes. He supported players who spoke out on issues like police brutality, racial inequality, and LGBTQ+ rights, and he recognized the important role that athletes could play in promoting social change.
Stern also understood the importance of marketing the NBA to a diverse audience. He worked to expand the league’s reach beyond the United States, building relationships with broadcasters and sponsors in countries like China and Europe. He also encouraged the league’s teams to engage with their local communities, and he supported initiatives that promoted basketball to young people from all backgrounds.
Perhaps most importantly, Stern recognized that the NBA’s success was inextricably tied to the success of its players, and he worked tirelessly to ensure that they were treated fairly and equitably. He negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that provided players with better salaries, benefits, and working conditions, and he worked to create a league that valued players as more than just athletes.
Overall, David Stern’s handling of race in the NBA was characterized by a commitment to diversity, player empowerment, and social justice. His approach helped to transform the league into one of the most inclusive and progressive professional sports organizations in the world, and it set a standard for other leagues to follow. Today, as the NBA continues to grapple with issues related to race and social justice, Stern’s legacy remains a powerful reminder of the transformative power of leadership and vision.
