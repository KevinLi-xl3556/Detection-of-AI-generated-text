The Mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, has spoken out regarding the need for the city’s museums to enhance their sexual harassment policies. In light of the growing awareness of systemic sexism and harassment in the workplace, Mayor Kenney highlights the importance of a zero-tolerance approach to sexual misconduct.
Speaking to reporters, Kenney stated that "all institutions, including museums, must work towards a culture of respect and safety for all employees.” The Mayor stresses that museums are not immune to sexual harassment and predatory behavior, and must take active steps to protect their employees.
While Philadelphia museums have policies in place to address sexual harassment and discrimination, the Mayor advocates for these policies to be revised and strengthened. He points out that victims of sexual harassment often do not speak out due to a lack of confidence in the system and fear of retaliation. Revised policies must take into account how to effectively respond to incidents of harassment and ensure victims feel confident in reporting any behavior that makes them feel uncomfortable.
Kenney also highlights the importance of comprehensive training for museum staff. This training should educate employees on what constitutes harassment, how to recognize it, and how to report it. It should also provide employees with the tools and resources necessary to deal with harassment, including providing a safe space to report such incidents.
City officials, museum directors and leaders, and advocates are working together to implement changes necessary to address the culture of sexual harassment and misconduct that has prevailed in the past. Mayor Kenney’s proactive stance against sexual harassment in the workplace has set an example for other leaders to follow.
In conclusion, sexual harassment is a serious issue that affects many industries, including the arts. Mayor Kenney of Philadelphia has taken an important step towards ensuring that the city’s museums provide a safe and respectful work environment for all employees. By strengthening policies and providing training, museums will create an atmosphere of accountability and ensure that any type of harassment will not be tolerated.
