Diane Ravitch Declares the Education Reform Movement Dead
Diane Ravitch, a renowned educator and historian of education, has made a bold statement. In her latest book, “Slaying Goliath: The Passionate Resistance to Privatization and the Fight to Save America’s Public Schools,” she declares the education reform movement dead.
The education reform movement, which gained momentum in the 1990s with the introduction of No Child Left Behind and continued through the Obama administration with Race to the Top, aimed to improve education in America. The movement focused on introducing standardized testing, increasing accountability, and incentivizing the creation of charter schools.
However, Ravitch argues that the movement failed to achieve its goals and instead damaged public education. She cites the negative effects of standardized testing, which led to a narrowing of the curriculum and teaching to the test. She also contends that charter schools, often promoted as a solution to failing public schools, haven’t shown improvement overall and have drained resources from public schools.
Ravitch asserts that the education reform movement was driven by a belief that schools were failing, without acknowledging the role poverty and inequality play in student achievement. She also points out that the movement was fueled by wealthy philanthropists and corporate interests, who sought to privatize education for their own profit.
Despite this, Ravitch has hope for the future of public education. She points to successful grassroots movements that have resisted the education reform movement’s harmful policies, such as opt-out movements that boycott standardized testing. She also highlights the role of teachers and unions in advocating for students and standing up to the privatization of education.
Ravitch’s book serves as a rallying cry for those who believe in the value of a public education system. Her message is clear: the education reform movement’s damaging policies must be challenged, and resources must be invested in public schools to provide students with a quality education.
In conclusion, Diane Ravitch has declared the education reform movement dead, due to its failure to achieve its goals and its negative impact on public education. However, she sees hope in the resistance movements that have emerged and the ongoing fight to save America’s public schools. It’s important to heed Ravitch’s message and prioritize investment in public schools to ensure all students receive a quality education, regardless of their background or zip code.
