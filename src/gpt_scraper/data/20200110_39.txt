Harold Burson, a pioneer in the field of public relations, passed away on January 10, 2020, at the age of 98. Burson was a giant in the industry, having founded one of the most successful PR firms in the world and having played a key role in shaping the field of public relations into what it is today.
Burson was born on February 15, 1921, in Memphis, Tennessee. He graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1940 and served in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in France and Germany. After the war, Burson began his career in journalism before transitioning to public relations in 1947.
In 1952, Burson founded Burson-Marsteller, which would become one of the world’s largest PR firms. The company grew rapidly, opening offices across the United States and around the world. Burson played a key role in developing the firm’s reputation for providing strategic communications counsel to businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations.
Over the course of his long career, Burson worked with some of the world’s largest companies and organizations, including Coca-Cola, American Express, and the United Nations. He was known for his ability to build strong relationships with clients and his commitment to providing high-quality, ethical PR services.
Burson was also a prolific author, writing numerous books on public relations and communications. His most famous book, “The Business of Persuasion,” was first published in 1963 and has since become a classic in the field.
In addition to his work in public relations, Burson was also a philanthropist and a dedicated community leader. He served on the board of directors for numerous organizations, including the Arthur W. Page Society and the Museum of Public Relations.
Burson’s impact on the field of public relations cannot be overstated. He played a key role in transforming PR from a narrow field focused on media relations into a broader discipline focused on strategic communications. His firm, Burson-Marsteller, was at the forefront of this transformation, pioneering new techniques for managing corporate reputation, crisis communications, and stakeholder engagement.
Despite his many achievements, Burson remained humble and dedicated to his work. He once said, “I never thought of myself as a giant. I just thought of myself as a guy who tried to do his job, tried to make a difference in the lives of people he worked with, and tried to serve the community he lived in.”
Harold Burson’s legacy will continue to inspire future generations of public relations professionals. His commitment to excellence, ethics, and community service will remain a model for all those who aspire to succeed in this dynamic and challenging field.
