The impeachment of former President Donald Trump has been a hot topic in American politics since the events of January 6th, 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. With Trump’s second impeachment trial looming, his legal team is taking shape.
Trump’s impeachment trial is set to begin on February 9th, 2021, and his legal team has been steadily assembling since the House of Representatives voted to impeach him on January 13th. Trump’s first impeachment trial in 2019 ended in acquittal, but this time the stakes are even higher, as he is no longer in office.
One of the key members of Trump’s legal team is David Schoen, a criminal defense attorney from Alabama. Schoen has experience in both civil and criminal law, and has represented clients in high-profile cases, including accused terrorists. Schoen has made several appearances on Fox News, where he has expressed his support for Trump and criticized the impeachment process.
Another member of Trump’s legal team is Bruce Castor, a former district attorney in Pennsylvania. Castor gained national attention in 2005 when he declined to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault, a decision that he has defended in recent years. Castor was also criticized for his handling of a high-profile murder case in 2016.
Both Schoen and Castor have been working on Trump’s defense strategy in recent weeks. Trump is reportedly planning to argue that the impeachment is unconstitutional, as he is no longer in office. He is also expected to claim that his speech on January 6th, which many have characterized as inciting the mob, was protected by the First Amendment.
Despite the high stakes of the impeachment trial, Trump’s legal team has faced some challenges. Several prominent law firms have declined to represent him, citing concerns about the political implications of taking on the case. Trump’s previous legal team, which represented him during his first impeachment trial, also faced criticism for their handling of the case.
As the trial approaches, both Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for what promises to be a contentious and closely-watched event. The outcome of the trial is far from certain, but regardless of the verdict, it is clear that the impeachment of Donald Trump will go down in history as one of the most significant events in American political history.
