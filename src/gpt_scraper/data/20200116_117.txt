Review: ‘Troop Zero’ - A New Generation of Underdogs
In today’s society, it’s becoming more and more important to showcase diverse voices, especially when it comes to films, and TV series. “Troop Zero” is one such refreshing movie which is a coming-of-age drama that is a must-watch for all ages! Directed by Bert & Bertie, this movie is the perfect blend of drama and comedy.
Set in rural Georgia in the mid-1970s, “Troop Zero” follows the story of Christmas Flint (played magnificently by newcomer Mckenna Grace), a young girl who dreams of outer space and communicating with alien life. Her mother once told her that those who die go to the universe, and this idea inspires her.
The narrative is focused on Christmas Flint and her journey to get into the Birdie Scouts, a popular girl’s club in the Southern USA, which is very prestigious. Unfortunately, due to her poverty-stricken background, and the fact that she doesn’t fit in with the club members, she is rejected from the organization.
Undeterred, Christmas puts together her own troop: the “Birdie Scouts of Troop Zero”. Her group of misfit pals include Joseph, the only boy in the club and has facial hair, Annie, a girl who carries her dead mother’s ashes in a tube, and Smash, a shy girl who wants to be a dancer but has a stutter.
The story is driven forward with their adventure to win a talent competition, the winner of which will have their voice put on the Voyager spacecraft, which is intended to fly beyond the solar system, and communicate with extraterrestrial life. Christmas sees this as her chance to communicate with her dead mother, and the rest of her troop members, see it as an opportunity to have their voices be heard and recognized.
The biggest strength of the movie is the heart and the spirit that it captures. The way the movie portrays the underdogs is exceptional. The Troop Zero’s members are all seen as outsiders and somewhat weird by the people around them; however, together they represent the values of togetherness, equality, and difference.
The performances in the movie are memorable, especially Alice (Viola Davis), the troop’s den mother, who is dealing with her loss in a heartfelt way. The movie’s ending delivers a powerful message of empowerment, and that even the most unlikely of people can achieve greatness with a little persistence and faith in themselves.
In conclusion, “Troop Zero” is not the most groundbreaking movie of our time, but it is a warm, humorous, and moving narrative that is perfect for all audiences. It challenges our perception of who we are, what we can aspire to, and what we can achieve. It is a must-watch for anyone who is looking for a feel-good movie with heart and spirit that is enjoyable and uplifting from start to finish.
