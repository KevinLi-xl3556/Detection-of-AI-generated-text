The rustic walls are adorned with local art, and the furniture and decor are warm and inviting. The spacious living room features a cozy fireplace, perfect for chilly nights.
The highlight of the home is undoubtedly the outdoor area. The house is surrounded by a vineyard and lush gardens filled with fragrant lavender and rosemary. The terrace provides spectacular views of the rolling hills and vineyards of Tuscany, making it an ideal place for morning coffee or evening drinks.

When he’s at home, Imperioli enjoys cooking with fresh, local ingredients and spending time with his family. He is often joined by fellow Sopranos cast members, who come to visit and enjoy the beauty and tranquility of Tuscany.
