As the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump rages on, there is a looming question that continues to perplex both American citizens and lawmakers alike: Can Trump actually stop the Senate from hearing from witnesses?
The short answer to this question is no. However, the answer is more nuanced than a simple yes or no. Let’s take a closer look at the situation.
To start, it’s important to understand that the decision to call witnesses during an impeachment trial is left up to the Senate. The Senate has the power to subpoena witnesses and compel them to testify. This means that even if Trump were to try and prevent witnesses from testifying, he simply does not have the authority to do so.
However, Trump could potentially try and prevent certain witnesses from testifying by claiming executive privilege. Executive privilege is a power that allows a president to withhold information from Congress or the courts if he deems it necessary for national security or other reasons. In theory, Trump could claim executive privilege in order to prevent certain individuals from testifying.
It’s worth noting, however, that the Supreme Court has previously ruled that executive privilege does not extend to cover every possible scenario. In United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled that executive privilege could not be used to shield evidence that was relevant to a criminal trial. This means that if the Senate determines that certain witnesses are relevant to the impeachment trial, Trump would not be able to use executive privilege to prevent them from testifying.
Furthermore, it’s important to remember that the impeachment trial is being presided over by a bipartisan group of senators, including the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Both of these individuals have stated that witnesses should be allowed to testify, and it’s unlikely that they will be swayed by any efforts from Trump to prevent this from happening.
In conclusion, while Trump may try and prevent the Senate from hearing from witnesses, he ultimately does not have the power to do so. The decision to call witnesses is left up to the Senate, and if they determine that certain individuals are relevant to the impeachment trial, Trump would not be able to use executive privilege to prevent them from testifying.
