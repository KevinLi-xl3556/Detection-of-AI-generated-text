Today marks the beginning of the Senate trial for former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment. The trial will take place over several days, and there is much speculation about what to expect. In this article, we will explore the key issues at stake in the trial and provide an overview of what we can expect to see unfold in the coming days.
The Charges
Donald Trump has been charged with “incitement of insurrection” following the events of January 6th, 2021. On that day, a violent mob stormed the Capitol building, resulting in five deaths and widespread damage. Trump is accused of encouraging his supporters to engage in this violent behavior through his rhetoric and actions leading up to the event. The impeachment managers, led by Representative Jamie Raskin, will present evidence to support these charges.
The Defense
Trump’s defense team, led by Bruce Castor and David Schoen, will argue that the former President did not incite the violence at the Capitol and that his speech on January 6th was protected under the First Amendment. They will also likely argue that it is unconstitutional to impeach a former President.
The Trial
The Senate trial will be presided over by Senator Patrick Leahy, who is the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. The trial will begin with opening arguments from both the impeachment managers and Trump’s defense team. Each side will have up to 16 hours to present their case.
Following the opening arguments, Senators will have the opportunity to question both sides. This will be followed by closing arguments from each side. After the closing arguments, the Senate will vote on whether or not to convict Trump. A two-thirds majority is required for conviction.
What to Expect
There are several key issues to watch for during the trial. First, it will be interesting to see how the impeachment managers present their case. They will likely focus on Trump’s actions leading up to the Capitol riot, including his repeated false claims about election fraud and his encouragement of his supporters to march on the Capitol. They will also likely use video footage and other evidence to show the violent nature of the attack.
Second, it will be interesting to see how Trump’s defense team responds. They will likely argue that Trump’s speech was protected under the First Amendment and that the impeachment is unconstitutional. They may also try to shift the blame onto the rioters themselves, arguing that they were responsible for their own actions.
Third, it will be interesting to see how Senators vote. While it is unlikely that two-thirds of the Senate will vote to convict Trump, there are several Republican Senators who have expressed dissatisfaction with Trump’s behavior leading up to the Capitol riot. It remains to be seen whether any of these Senators will vote to convict.
Conclusion
The Senate trial for Donald Trump’s second impeachment is set to begin today, and there is much speculation about what to expect. While it is unlikely that two-thirds of the Senate will vote to convict Trump, the trial will provide an opportunity for the impeachment managers to present their case and for Senators to weigh the evidence. Regardless of the outcome, this trial will be an important moment in American history and will shape the future of American politics for years to come.
