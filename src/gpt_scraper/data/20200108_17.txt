In recent years, there has been a growing conversation in the publishing industry about the need for greater diversity and inclusion. This conversation has come to a head in the romance genre, which has long been criticized for its lack of representation. One recent example of this was the withdrawal of several publishers from a prominent romance conference, citing concerns over diversity.
The conference in question is the Romance Writers of America (RWA) annual conference, which has been held for over 30 years. The RWA is the largest professional organization for romance writers in the United States, and the conference is a major event in the industry. However, in recent years, the conference has faced controversy over issues of diversity and inclusion.
The controversy began in 2019, when a group of authors raised concerns about racism and discrimination within the organization. This led to a series of resignations from the RWA board, and a significant shake-up of the organization’s leadership. However, many authors and publishers felt that the RWA’s response was inadequate, and that more needed to be done to address the underlying issues.
This year, several publishers announced that they would be withdrawing from the RWA conference, citing concerns over the organization’s handling of diversity and inclusion. These included Avon Books, Kensington Books, and Entangled Publishing, among others. In a joint statement, the publishers said:
“We believe that the RWA has not done enough to address the concerns of marginalized authors and industry professionals. We cannot in good conscience continue to support an organization that does not prioritize diversity and inclusion. We hope that the RWA will take meaningful action to address these issues and create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all members.”
The publishers’ decision was met with both support and criticism from the romance community. Some authors praised the publishers for taking a stand and pushing for change, while others felt that the decision would hurt the industry as a whole. However, it is clear that the conversation about diversity and inclusion in romance is far from over.
The RWA has responded to the publishers’ statement, saying that they are committed to making the organization more inclusive and welcoming to all members. They have announced several initiatives aimed at improving diversity and inclusion within the organization, including a new code of ethics and a diversity, equity, and inclusion committee. However, it remains to be seen whether these initiatives will be enough to address the underlying issues.
The controversy surrounding the RWA conference highlights the ongoing need for greater diversity and inclusion in the publishing industry. While progress has been made in recent years, there is still much work to be done. As readers and writers, we must continue to push for change and hold the industry accountable for creating a more diverse and inclusive landscape.
