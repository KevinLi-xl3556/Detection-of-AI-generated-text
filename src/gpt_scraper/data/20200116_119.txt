‘VHYes’ Review: Channel Surfing and Self-Soothing
VHYes, directed by Jack Henry Robbins, is an endearing and amusing tribute to the art of VHS videotaping, television infomercials, and nostalgic reverie. The film is a quirky anthology of late-night television programs, home movies, public access shows, and instructional videos. The humour and heart of VHYes lies in its ability to capture the naivety, absurdity, and innocence of 80s and 90s pop culture while thwarting the expectations of conventional storytelling.
The film centers around a young boy, Ralph (Mason McNulty), who receives a camcorder for his birthday and starts recording random clips from various TV shows, movies, and family gatherings. With each recording, the viewer is transported into a bizarre and often surreal world where a yoga instructor becomes a mesmerizing seductress, a QVC salesman turns into a religious zealot, and a cooking show host transforms into a demented clown.
The highlight of VHYes is its consistent commitment to recreating the experience of channel surfing, where one moment you might tune into a music video countdown and then switch to a talk show about UFO sightings. The film revels in the clumsiness of public access productions, where hosts stumble over words and guests awkwardly promote their products. This amateurish charm is perhaps best exemplified in an extended skit featuring Tim Robbins (the director’s father), who plays a bumbling magician trying to promote his act on a local cable channel.
Although VHYes may appear to be an aimless and chaotic montage of disparate images, the film does have some underlying themes and messages. The most obvious is the idea that filmmaking and storytelling can be a form of self-soothing and self-expression. Ralph’s fixation of recording mundane moments of his life can be seen as a way of coping with his parents’ marital problems and his own struggles with identity.
The film also touches on notions of nostalgia and the value of preserving memories. VHYes is an ode to the lost era of VHS tapes, where people could truly experience the joy of being passive viewers and curators of their own media landscape. In an age of endless streaming options and algorithmic recommendations, VHYes reminds us of the pleasure of stumbling onto unexpected and unlikely treasures.
At times, VHYes can border on being too self-indulgent and repetitive. The film’s gimmick of mimicking the look and feel of old VHS tapes can become tiresome, and some of the skits feel unnecessarily long. However, these flaws are minor quibbles in a film that successfully celebrates the joy and absurdity of television culture.
In conclusion, VHYes is a charming and whimsical tribute to the art of channel surfing and VHS culture. It’s a film that celebrates the beauty of the ordinary, the power of nostalgia, and the delight of discovery. VHYes is perfect for those who yearn for a simpler time of media consumption but also for those who appreciate subversive and unconventional films.
