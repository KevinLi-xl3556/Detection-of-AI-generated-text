‘Cleanness,’ by Garth Greenwell: An Excerpt
Garth Greenwell’s latest novel, “Cleanness,” has been making waves in the literary world since its release. Known for his raw and poetic prose, Greenwell has once again captivated readers with his powerful storytelling. Set in Bulgaria, “Cleanness” explores themes of desire, identity, and intimacy in a deeply emotional and introspective manner. In this article, we will delve into an excerpt from “Cleanness” and explore Greenwell’s masterful use of language and imagery.
The excerpt begins with the protagonist, an American teacher named Luchin, reflecting on his relationships and encounters with various men. Through his stream of consciousness, we get a glimpse into his inner world and the complexity of his emotions. Greenwell’s writing is both evocative and precise, drawing the reader into Luchin’s thoughts and experiences.
One of the standout features of Greenwell’s writing is his attention to detail. In “Cleanness,” he masterfully describes the physicality of intimacy, capturing the sensations and emotions that arise during moments of connection with another person. In the excerpt, Luchin recalls a moment with a lover, and Greenwell’s vivid descriptions of their bodies and movements create a palpable sense of intimacy:
“His body bowed, his hands grasped my head, and I felt him spread his legs to make room for me, and his mouth grew wild, a glaze forming in his eyes, his throat trembled, he bucked and moaned, he plunged, I thrust him to the very back of his throat, and suddenly he had taken it all in, he was breathing only with his nose, he had pressed my pubic hair against his chin, and the breath from his nostrils was hot, and as his throat worked and his mouth clenched and he made those choked sounds deep in his chest I felt as if I had gone entirely into him, as if I were spilling over into him, as if my body had emptied itself into him and my body were pulsing in his mouth.”
Greenwell’s use of language in this passage is breathtaking. The sensory details, such as the feeling of breath on the skin and the physical sensations of bodies intertwining, are vividly depicted. He also delves into the emotional intensity of the moment, capturing the vulnerability, desire, and intimacy that Luchin experiences.
Another notable aspect of “Cleanness” is Greenwell’s exploration of the complexities of desire and identity. Luchin, as a gay man living in a foreign country, grapples with his own sense of self and his desires, as well as the societal and cultural expectations placed upon him. In the excerpt, Luchin reflects on his relationships and encounters with other men, ranging from fleeting connections to deep emotional bonds. Greenwell navigates the intricacies of desire and intimacy with nuance and sensitivity, delving into the internal struggles and conflicts that Luchin faces.
In addition to its exploration of desire and intimacy, “Cleanness” also delves into themes of power dynamics, shame, and self-acceptance. Luchin grapples with his own vulnerabilities and fears, as well as the complexities of navigating relationships with others. Greenwell’s writing is unapologetically honest and raw, and he fearlessly explores the depths of Luchin’s emotions and experiences.
As with Greenwell’s previous works, “Cleanness” is also notable for its lyrical prose. His writing is poetic and evocative, drawing the reader into Luchin’s world with its rich imagery and poignant language. Each sentence is carefully crafted, carrying layers of meaning and emotion.
