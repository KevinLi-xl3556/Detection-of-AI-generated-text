On Thursday, MLB announced that they are suspending New York Yankees pitcher Domingo German for 81 games due to a domestic violence incident that occurred in September 2019. The suspension took effect immediately, which means that German will miss the entire 2020 season and playoff games, and his suspension will continue into the 2021 season for the first 63 games.
German, who is 28 years old, was seen as an important part of the Yankees’ rotation in the upcoming season, but the team will now have to find a replacement. The Yankees’ general manager, Brian Cashman, released a statement in which he supported the league’s decision and said that the team took the allegations seriously.
The incident, which took place on September 16th last year, involved German and his girlfriend, who he has been dating for some time. According to reports, German was involved in a heated argument with his girlfriend at an event in a venue he rented for his own birthday party. Witnesses have also reported seeing German getting physical with his girlfriend, which caused people to become concerned and ultimately led to the police being called.
While this is the first time German has been suspended due to domestic violence, the incident is the latest in a long line of other domestic violence incidents that have plagued the MLB in recent years. The league has made it clear that they will not tolerate any domestic violence incidents and that they will take a firm stance on anyone involved in incidents of this nature.
The suspension of German is not only a reminder that domestic violence is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, but also that athletes are not above the law. The MLB is taking the necessary steps to ensure that all players understand that they will face consequences if they engage in any form of domestic violence.
While the suspension is a necessary consequence, it is also important to remember that domestic violence is not just an issue in sports. It is a pervasive problem in our society, and it affects people of all ages, races, and genders. We must all play our part in raising awareness about domestic violence and working towards a future where it is no longer a major concern.
In conclusion, the suspension of Domingo German is a reminder of the importance of taking a stand against domestic violence. We must all take a stand against domestic violence to ensure that everyone feels safe and supported. It is only by working together that we can create a future where incidents of domestic violence are rare, and all individuals are able to live their lives free from fear.
