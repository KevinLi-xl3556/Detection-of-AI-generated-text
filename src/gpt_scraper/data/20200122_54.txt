In a landmark case before the Supreme Court, religious schools may soon see an end to limits on state aid. The case in question, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, centers on the use of public funds for students attending religious schools.
Currently, Montana has a program that provides tax credits to individuals and corporations who donate to scholarship organizations. These organizations, in turn, offer scholarships to students who can use them to attend private schools, including those with a religious affiliation.
However, in 2018, Montana’s Supreme Court struck down the program, citing a state law that prohibits public funding for any school affiliated with a religious organization. The plaintiffs in Espinoza argue that this decision violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
During oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January, the justices seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs’ case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that Montana’s law was “discriminatory” against religious schools and “seems to focus on religion.” Justice Samuel Alito echoed this sentiment, stating that the law “singles out” religious schools for discriminatory treatment.
If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, it could have far-reaching implications for school choice and religious freedom. Proponents of the decision argue that parents should be able to use public funds to send their children to the school of their choice, including religious schools, without fear of discrimination.
Critics, however, warn that allowing public funds to flow to religious schools could violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from establishing or favoring any particular religion.
Whatever the outcome of Espinoza, it’s clear that the issue of state aid to religious schools is a contentious one that will continue to be debated in classrooms, courtrooms, and legislative chambers across the country.
