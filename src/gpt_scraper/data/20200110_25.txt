On a peaceful Friday afternoon, worshippers gathered at a mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province for prayers. However, their peaceful moment was interrupted by a bomb blast claimed by the terrorist group ISIS, which killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more. The mosque was reportedly being used by the Taliban as a place of worship at the time of the attack.
The incident took place in the town of Hangu, located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan. The region has been plagued by sectarian violence for years, with militants carrying out attacks on mosques, markets, and other public places.
According to local officials, the bomb was planted inside the mosque and was detonated during Friday prayers. The blast caused significant damage to the building and nearby shops. Rescue teams and law enforcement agencies rushed to the scene and cordoned off the area.
The attack was immediately claimed by ISIS, which has been increasingly active in the region in recent years. The group has been trying to establish a foothold in Pakistan, which has been a base for other militant groups in the past. The Pakistani government has launched several operations against these groups in recent years, but they continue to pose a threat to the country’s security.
The Taliban, which has been fighting the Pakistani government for years, also condemned the attack. The group’s spokesman said in a statement that “attacking a mosque during prayers is against the teachings of Islam and is a heinous crime.” The Taliban has also been targeted by ISIS in the past, with the two groups competing for influence and control over the region.
The attack on the mosque has once again raised concerns about the security situation in Pakistan. The country has been the scene of numerous terrorist attacks in recent years, with groups like the Taliban, ISIS, and al-Qaeda carrying out attacks on civilian and military targets. The government has launched several operations to combat these groups, but the threat remains.
The international community has condemned the attack, with many countries expressing their solidarity with Pakistan. The United Nations has also issued a statement condemning the attack and calling on the Pakistani government to bring the perpetrators to justice.
In conclusion, the bomb blast in the mosque in Hangu is a tragic reminder of the ongoing threat posed by militant groups in Pakistan. The attack, claimed by ISIS, has once again highlighted the need for the Pakistani government to take decisive action to tackle the threat of terrorism. The international community must also continue to support Pakistan in its efforts to combat terrorism and promote peace and stability in the region.
