Seven Days in January: How Trump Pushed U.S. and Iran to the Brink of War
In the first week of January 2020, tensions between the United States and Iran reached a fever pitch. The catalyst for this escalation was the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike on January 3, 2020. This single event set off a chain reaction that brought the two nations to the brink of war, with both sides trading threats and engaging in military actions.
President Donald Trump ordered the strike against General Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, citing an imminent threat to U.S. personnel in the region. The move was met with condemnation from Iran and its allies, who vowed to retaliate.
Over the next several days, tensions between the two nations ratcheted up, with Iran launching missile strikes against U.S. bases in Iraq and Trump threatening to strike back with “disproportionate” force. The situation appeared to be spiraling out of control, with fears of a wider war in the Middle East looming.
Here is a timeline of the events that transpired over the seven days following Soleimani’s killing:
January 3, 2020: U.S. drone strike kills General Qasem Soleimani

January 5, 2020: Iran announces it will no longer abide by the nuclear deal
In a further escalation, Iran announced that it would no longer abide by the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which had been designed to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief.
January 6, 2020: Iran launches missile strikes against U.S. bases in Iraq

January 8, 2020: Iran shoots down Ukrainian passenger plane
In a tragic mistake, Iran’s military shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Iran initially denied responsibility for the incident, but later admitted that it had accidentally shot down the plane.
January 9, 2020: Trump announces new sanctions against Iran
In a speech to the nation, Trump announced new sanctions against Iran and called for new negotiations to replace the nuclear deal.
The seven days following the killing of Soleimani were a tense and uncertain time for both the United States and Iran. The situation could have easily spiraled out of control, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the region and the world. However, both sides ultimately stepped back from the brink of war, and tensions have since eased somewhat.
The events of those seven days serve as a reminder of how easily conflicts can escalate, and how important it is for leaders to exercise restraint and diplomacy in times of crisis. The world was fortunate to avoid a wider war in the wake of Soleimani’s killing, but the risk of further conflict between the U.S. and Iran remains a concern, particularly as tensions continue to simmer in
