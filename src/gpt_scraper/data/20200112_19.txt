The world of classic cars has always been one of fascination and allure, and recently, one particular car has captured the attention of collectors and enthusiasts alike. The 1968 Ford Mustang GT, known as the “Mona Lisa of Mustangs,” has set a new record for auction sales.
The Mustang, made famous for its appearance in the classic film “Bullitt,” is considered one of the most iconic muscle cars of all time. It was driven by Steve McQueen in the movie’s legendary chase scene through the streets of San Francisco. The car’s sleek design and powerful engine have made it a favorite of car enthusiasts for decades.
The “Mona Lisa of Mustangs” is one of only two surviving cars used in the filming of “Bullitt.” It was thought to have been lost for many years until it was discovered in a garage in Mexico in 2018. The car underwent an extensive restoration process, which included verifying its authenticity through VIN and other identifying features.
After its restoration, the Mustang made its way to the Mecum Auctions event in Kissimmee, Florida, in January 2020. Bidding for the car quickly escalated, with interested buyers from around the world vying for the chance to own this piece of automotive history.
In the end, the “Mona Lisa of Mustangs” was sold for a record-breaking $3.74 million, making it the most expensive Mustang ever sold at auction. The winning bidder, an anonymous collector, now owns one of the most sought-after cars in the world.
The sale of the “Mona Lisa of Mustangs” highlights the enduring appeal of classic cars, especially those with a rich history and a famous pedigree. Cars like the Mustang GT from “Bullitt” have become cultural touchstones, representing an era of American history when cars were more than just transportation – they were symbols of freedom, power, and speed.
While the price of the “Mona Lisa of Mustangs” may seem steep to some, it’s a testament to the enduring legacy of this iconic car and the passion of those who collect and preserve classic automobiles. As the years go by, the Mustang GT from “Bullitt” will continue to be a beloved symbol of a bygone era, and the “Mona Lisa of Mustangs” will always be remembered as one of the most important cars in automotive history.
