As 2020 unfolds and the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, many are curious about what lies ahead for white-collar prosecutions. With many businesses struggling to stay afloat and the economic downturn, it is a challenging time for those investigating and prosecuting white-collar crimes. Hereâ€™s what we can expect in the coming months.
Firstly, there are likely to be fewer prosecutions. The pandemic has slowed down the justice system, and many court hearings and trials have been postponed. White-collar cases often require a significant amount of resources, and with limited budgets and staffing, they may not be a priority for prosecutors.
However, those cases that do proceed are likely to involve fraud related to the pandemic. We have already seen examples of this, with companies and individuals taking advantage of the crisis to commit fraud. Prosecutors will be looking for cases where people have taken advantage of others, such as by selling fake medical equipment or creating fraudulent charities.
It is also expected that there will be greater focus on individuals rather than corporations. Recent years have seen a trend towards prosecuting companies for white-collar crimes. It is expected that in 2020, prosecutors will be looking to hold individuals accountable for their actions as well. This change in focus is likely to be driven by a desire to hold individuals accountable and send a message that white-collar crime will not be tolerated.
Another trend that is likely to continue is the use of technology in investigations. As in many areas of life, technology has changed the landscape for white-collar investigations. Prosecutors are increasingly using data analysis and other tools, such as artificial intelligence, to identify potential fraud and other white-collar crimes.
Finally, it is important to note that we may see changes in the types of white-collar crimes being prosecuted. With the economic downturn, it is possible that we will see more cases relating to bankruptcy fraud, insider trading, or Ponzi schemes.
In conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for white-collar prosecutions, there are still likely to be cases going forward. Prosecutors will be looking for cases related to fraud related to the pandemic, using technology in investigations, and shifting their focus back to holding individuals accountable. Whatever the future holds, it is clear that white-collar prosecutions are still an important tool for holding wrongdoers accountable for their actions.
