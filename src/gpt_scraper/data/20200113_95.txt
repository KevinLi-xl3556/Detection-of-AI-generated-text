Away’s Once and Future C.E.O.
Away, the popular luggage brand, has been in the limelight for the past year, but for all the wrong reasons. The company’s co-founder Steph Korey was forced to step down as CEO in 2019 after facing allegations of fostering a toxic work environment. Korey’s resignation resulted in a loss of trust and a hit to the company’s reputation, leading to a decline in sales.
But Away has recently announced that Steph Korey will be returning to the company as co-CEO alongside Stuart Haselden, previously Lululemon’s Chief Operating Officer. This news has ignited a debate within the industry, with some praising the move as a second chance for Korey, while others are concerned about the potential consequences for the brand.
Away’s decision to rehire Korey can be seen as a strategic move to rebuild trust and restore the brand’s image. Korey’s return has been framed as a way to bring her expertise back to the table while also allowing Haselden to bring in a fresh perspective to the company’s operations. Haselden’s background in retail and digital strategy will be valuable in helping Away grow and attract new customers.
On the other hand, it’s hard to ignore the negative press that surrounded Korey’s departure. The allegations of a toxic work environment damaged the company’s reputation, and many employees and customers will remember the controversy. Brands that have dealt with similar issues have struggled to recover, and it’s unclear whether Away will be able to move past this.
It’s important to note that Korey has taken steps to address the allegations since her departure. She apologized for her behavior and announced that she would be seeking professional help. And while the situation has been a learning opportunity for the company, it remains to be seen whether the necessary changes have been made to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Away’s decision to bring back Korey comes at a time when the company is facing increased competition from other luggage brands. The pandemic has also impacted travel, leading to a slump in sales. The brand will need to work hard to make up for lost ground and regain customer loyalty.
Only time will tell whether Away’s move was a smart one. If the company can successfully move past the controversy and use Korey’s leadership skills to drive growth, it may prove to be a smart decision. However, if Korey’s past behavior resurfaces or the company fails to address the underlying issues, it could lead to further damage. For now, all eyes are on Away and its once and future CEOs.
