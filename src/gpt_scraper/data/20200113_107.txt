The Bearable Whiteness of ‘Little Women’
Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel ‘Little Women’ has been a well-loved story for generations. The novel depicts the story of four sisters growing up in Concord, Massachusetts in the mid-1800s, and their coming-of-age journeys. The novel has been adapted countless times for film, TV, and the stage, and most recently for a 2019 film adaptation directed by Greta Gerwig. Despite the novel’s enduring popularity, however, there has been much debate in recent years about its lack of diversity.
Critics have long pointed out that the novel and its adaptations are overwhelmingly white, with little representation of people of color. Some have called for more diverse adaptations or retellings of the story. Others have pushed back against this idea, arguing that the novel should be appreciated for what it is – a portrayal of a specific time and place in American history, written by a white woman.
The debate over the “whiteness” of Little Women is a complex one, and there are valid points on both sides. On one hand, it is important to acknowledge the lack of diversity in the novel and its adaptations. The world in which the March sisters lived was undoubtedly a predominantly white one, but this does not mean that people of color did not exist in that time and place. Including more diverse characters in adaptations of the story could make it more engaging for audiences today, especially young people who may feel disconnected from the story due to its lack of representation.
On the other hand, it’s worth considering the historical context in which Little Women was written. Louisa May Alcott was writing in the mid-1800s, a time when racism was rampant in American society. While Alcott herself was a progressive thinker who supported abolition, she was also writing for a white audience who may not have been open to depictions of people of color in literature. Alcott’s choice to write a story about a white family may have been influenced by the racial politics of her time.
It’s also important to remember that Little Women is a story about family, friendship, and personal growth. While diversity is certainly important in literature, it is not the only factor that makes a story compelling. Little Women resonates with so many people because it speaks to universal experiences of growing up, finding one’s place in the world, and building relationships with others. These themes are not exclusive to white people – they are universal human experiences that everyone can relate to.
In the end, the question of the “whiteness” of Little Women is not an easy one to answer. It is a complex issue that requires thoughtful consideration and dialogue. While it is essential to recognize the lack of diversity in the novel and its adaptations, it is also important to appreciate the timeless themes and emotional resonance of the story. Whether or not the story should be adapted to include more diverse characters depends on how one views the purpose and message of the story. Ultimately, the value of ‘Little Women’ lies not in its representation of race or ethnicity, but in its depiction of the human experience.
