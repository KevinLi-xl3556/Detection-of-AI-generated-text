In a massive blow to Brazil’s cultural scene, the country’s top culture official, Roberto Alvim, was fired after delivering a speech evoking Nazi propaganda. The appalling incident occurred during a video released on Thursday, January 16th, by Alvim, who was appointed by President Jair Bolsonaro in Nov. 2019.
During the speech, which was meant to announce the launch of the National Arts Awards, Alvim can be seen sitting at a desk and addressing viewers in front of a portrait of Brazil’s far-right president. In the video, Alvim praises Brazilian art in a way that is eerily similar to that of Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Germany’s minister of propaganda. He mentions creating a new national culture, saying the country’s art will now be based on “heroic” and “national” elements.
Alvim goes on to say that Brazil’s culture should be an instrument in the fight against “cultural Marxism.” The term has been widely used by far-right activists to describe progressive cultural movements that they see as a threat to traditional values. These comments immediately caused outrage in Brazil, with many pointing out that the language and tone of Alvim’s speech were reminiscent of that used by the Nazis in the 1930s.
The video caused a wave of condemnation across Brazil, with many cultural figures and politicians denouncing Alvim’s speech as “Grotesque” and “a new level of crazy.” The Israelite Confederation of Brazil, which represents several Jewish organizations, issued a statement condemning the culture chief’s comments as “a clear act of nazi-fascist ideology.” President Jair Bolsonaro also issued a statement, saying that Alvim’s position had become “untenable” and that he had been fired from his post as culture secretary.
Alvim initially denied that he had any intention of evoking Nazi ideology, saying that the similarities between his speech and that of Goebbels were a “rhetorical coincidence.” But it soon emerged that the script of the video was almost identical to that of Goebbels’ 1933 address to the German people, in which he describes art as “an expression of the soul of a people.”
The incident has prompted fierce debate about the state of politics and culture in Brazil, with many fearing that the country is becoming increasingly intolerant towards minority groups and progressive cultural movements. Some have even drawn parallels between Alvim’s comments and the recent rise of far-right governments in other countries, such as the United States and Hungary.
Brazil’s rich cultural heritage has long been a source of pride for the country, but many fear that it is now under threat from a government that is increasingly promoting an agenda of cultural conservatism. The firing of Roberto Alvim is a welcome first step in restoring the country’s reputation as a bastion of creativity and diversity, but many still fear that harsher measures will be needed to combat the rise of far-right extremism in Brazil.
