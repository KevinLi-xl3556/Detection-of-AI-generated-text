The Iowa Reporter in the Middle of the 2020 Action
In the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, all eyes were on Iowa. As the first state to hold a caucus, Iowa has long been a key player in the presidential primary season, and this year was no exception. But as the state prepared for the caucuses, a small team of reporters at the Iowa Gazette found themselves at the center of the action.
The Gazette, a newspaper based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has a long history of covering politics in the state. But this year’s caucuses presented a unique challenge. With a crowded field of candidates and a highly polarized electorate, the stakes were high for both Democrats and Republicans.
The Gazette’s team of political reporters, led by veteran journalist Jennifer Jacobs, knew they had their work cut out for them. They spent months on the campaign trail, attending rallies and town halls, and interviewing candidates and voters. They also spent countless hours poring over polling data, analyzing voter trends, and trying to get a sense of the state’s political landscape.
As the caucuses approached, the Gazette’s team ramped up their coverage, providing in-depth analysis and breaking news updates around the clock. They were aided by a team of photographers and videographers, who captured the sights and sounds of the campaign trail.
On caucus day, the Gazette’s reporters fanned out across the state, covering the events as they unfolded. They spoke to voters at caucus sites, providing real-time updates on the results as they came in. They also interviewed candidates and campaign staffers, providing insights into the strategies and tactics that each campaign had employed.
In the end, the Iowa caucuses proved to be a pivotal moment in the 2020 presidential race. Despite some early technical glitches, the caucuses ultimately provided a clear win for Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side, while President Donald Trump cruised to victory on the Republican side.
But the Gazette’s coverage didn’t end there. In the weeks and months that followed, they continued to provide in-depth analysis of the candidates and their policies, as well as coverage of the ongoing primaries and debates.
For the Gazette’s team of reporters, the 2020 caucuses were a whirlwind of activity and excitement. But for them, it was all in a day’s work. As Jacobs said in an interview with NPR, “We’re journalists, and this is what we do. We cover politics, and we do it in Iowa, and we love it.”
