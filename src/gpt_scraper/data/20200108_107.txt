Eritrea, a small country located in the Horn of Africa, has been embroiled in a controversy related to forced labor practices for many years. Human rights organizations, as well as the United Nations, have repeatedly raised concerns about the use of forced labor in various sectors of the economy in Eritrea. This problem has been linked to projects funded by the European Union (E.U.), which has come under intense scrutiny in recent times.
The issue of forced labor in Eritrea goes back several decades when the country achieved liberation from Ethiopia after a long and bitter struggle. The ruling party, the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, has been accused of maintaining a system of forced labor that is used to build infrastructure projects across the country.
The use of forced labor in Eritrea is not limited to construction projects alone. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the government of Eritrea has also been involved in forced labor practices in the mining sector. This includes the Bisha Mine, which is jointly owned by the Eritrean government and a Canadian company, Nevsun Resources.
The involvement of the E.U. in funding various development projects in Eritrea has been a topic of controversy for several years. In 2015, the E.U. provided €200 million to Eritrea as part of its “Emergency Trust Fund for Africa” initiative, which was initiated to provide assistance to African countries affected by conflict and instability.
It is alleged that some of this funding has ended in the hands of the Eritrean government, which has used it to finance projects that involve forced labor practices. The E.U. has been criticized for not putting in place adequate safeguards to ensure that its funding does not indirectly support human rights abuses in the countries it works with.
In response to the allegations of forced labor practices in Eritrea, the E.U. has suspended several development projects that are being implemented in the country. However, this move has faced criticism from some quarters, who argue that it is a shallow gesture that does not go far enough.
The problem of forced labor practices in Eritrea is a complex one that requires a multi-faceted solution. The E.U. must not only put in place safeguards to ensure that its funding does not support human rights abuses in the country but also closely monitor the implementation of projects funded by it. It is also imperative that human rights organizations and the U.N. continue to raise awareness about the issue so that the international community can be more engaged in finding a lasting solution to this problem.
