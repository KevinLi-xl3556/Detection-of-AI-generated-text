The Oscars Tried to Diversify. Somehow Diversity Didn’t Follow.
The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, are widely considered the most prestigious film awards in the world. Every year, the ceremony attracts a global audience of millions of people, eager to see who will take home the coveted golden statuettes. However, for years, the Oscars have been criticized for their lack of diversity. In 2015, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite trended on social media, drawing attention to the underrepresentation of people of color in the nominations and winners.
In response to the backlash, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which oversees the Oscars, launched a series of initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the film industry. These efforts included expanding the membership of the Academy to include more women, people of color, and international filmmakers, as well as introducing new eligibility requirements for Best Picture nominees, such as the inclusion of diverse casting and production teams.
Despite these efforts, the Oscars continue to struggle with diversity. In the 2021 ceremony, only two of the 20 acting nominees were people of color, and none of them won. This was particularly surprising given the number of acclaimed performances by actors of color in that year’s eligible films, including Delroy Lindo in “Da 5 Bloods,” Viola Davis in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” and Riz Ahmed in “Sound of Metal.”
The lack of diversity in the acting categories is just one example of the larger problem. In recent years, the Oscars have also faced criticism for their underrepresentation of women, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities. Despite the efforts to increase the diversity of the Academy’s membership, it remains overwhelmingly white and male.
One possible explanation for the lack of progress is the deeply ingrained biases and power structures in Hollywood. The film industry has a long history of prioritizing the perspectives and experiences of white, male filmmakers and audiences, which can make it difficult for diverse voices to be heard and recognized. Additionally, the economic incentives of the industry often favor big-budget, mainstream films over smaller, more independent productions that may be more diverse in their casting and storytelling.
Another factor may be the Academy’s own limitations. While the organization has made efforts to increase diversity in its membership and nominations, it is ultimately just one part of the larger film industry. Without systemic changes across the industry, it may be difficult for the Oscars to truly reflect the diversity of contemporary filmmaking.
Despite these challenges, there are reasons for optimism. The success of films like “Black Panther,” “Moonlight,” and “Parasite” in recent years suggests that audiences are hungry for more diverse stories and perspectives. Additionally, there are a growing number of independent filmmakers and film festivals that are focused on promoting diversity and inclusion in the industry.
Ultimately, the lack of diversity in the Oscars is a symptom of a larger problem within the film industry. While the Academy’s efforts to promote diversity and inclusion are important, they must be accompanied by broader changes in the industry as a whole. By prioritizing diverse voices and experiences, we can create a film industry that truly reflects the diversity of our world and the stories that make it so rich.
