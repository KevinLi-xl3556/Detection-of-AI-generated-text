In recent years, the rise of Airbnb has disrupted the hotel industry by offering travelers an affordable and unique alternative to traditional hotel options. However, one union is taking a stand against the sharing economy giant, and has successfully defeated the company in one major city. Now, this union is setting its sights on a new target.
The union in question is UNITE HERE, a labor organization that represents hotel and hospitality workers in North America. In 2016, the union led a campaign against Airbnb in New York City, arguing that the company was taking away jobs from hotel workers and contributing to rising rents in the city.
As part of its campaign, UNITE HERE released a report that found that Airbnb had removed 9,200 housing units from the rental market, exacerbating the city’s affordable housing crisis. The union also encouraged New York lawmakers to crack down on short-term rentals and impose stricter regulations on Airbnb.
In response, Airbnb spent millions of dollars on lobbying and advertising campaigns, but ultimately failed to sway lawmakers in New York. In 2019, New York City passed a law that would require Airbnb and other home-sharing platforms to disclose information about their hosts and the rental properties they offer, in an effort to crack down on illegal rentals and preserve affordable housing.
Now, UNITE HERE is taking aim at a new sharing economy target: food delivery apps like Grubhub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash. In a report released earlier this year, the union argued that these apps are taking advantage of gig workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors rather than employees.
The report states that many food delivery workers are paid less than minimum wage, have no access to benefits or worker protections, and are forced to pay for their own expenses, such as gas and vehicle maintenance. The union argues that these practices are exploitative and contribute to income inequality.
UNITE HERE has launched a campaign to raise awareness about these issues and encourage lawmakers to take action. The union is calling for gig workers to be classified as employees, which would entitle them to minimum wage, benefits, and other worker protections.
The union’s campaign has already gained traction in several cities across the US. In California, lawmakers passed a law in 2019 that would reclassify gig workers as employees, although the law is currently facing legal challenges from companies like Uber and Lyft.
Whether UNITE HERE will be able to successfully take down food delivery apps like it did with Airbnb remains to be seen. However, the union’s efforts have already sparked an important conversation about worker rights in the sharing economy and the need for stronger regulations to protect gig workers.
