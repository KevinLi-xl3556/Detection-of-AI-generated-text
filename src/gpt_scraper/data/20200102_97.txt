Ursula K. Le Guin is considered one of the greatest science fiction and fantasy writers of all time, and her influence on the genre cannot be overstated. However, Le Guin’s talents extended far beyond writing, as she was also an accomplished poet. In fact, she once fooled the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert Hass with one of her poems.
The incident in question occurred in the 1980s, when Le Guin submitted a poem to the journal “The Threepenny Review” under the pseudonym “Ursula K. Leguin.” The poem, titled “The Author of the Acacia Seeds,” was a parody of a scientific paper and was written in the style of a fictional anthropologist.
Hass, who was the poetry editor of “The Threepenny Review” at the time, was immediately taken with the poem and praised it in a letter to the author. In the letter, Hass called the poem “brilliant” and said it was “a little masterpiece.” He even went so far as to say that it reminded him of the work of Jorge Luis Borges, a writer he greatly admired.
However, Hass was in for a surprise when Le Guin revealed that she was the real author of the poem. In a letter to Hass, Le Guin explained that the poem was a parody and was not meant to be taken seriously. She also expressed her surprise that Hass had not recognized her style, as she had previously published several poems in “The Threepenny Review.”
Hass later wrote about the incident in an essay titled “A Little Bit of a Muchness,” in which he reflected on the ways in which poets are sometimes fooled by their own preconceptions and expectations. He admitted that he had been “fooled” by Le Guin’s poem, and that he had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being open to new and unexpected voices.
The incident also highlighted Le Guin’s versatility as a writer, and her ability to write in a variety of genres and styles. Although she is best known for her science fiction and fantasy works, she was also a talented poet and essayist, and her contributions to these genres should not be overlooked.
In conclusion, Ursula K. Le Guin’s parody poem “The Author of the Acacia Seeds” fooled the poet Robert Hass, and in doing so, taught him an important lesson about the dangers of preconception and expectation. Le Guin’s talents as a writer extended far beyond the world of science fiction and fantasy, and her contributions to poetry and essay writing should be celebrated and remembered.
