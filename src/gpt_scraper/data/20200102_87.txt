Frederick’s of Hollywood Goes From Racy to ‘Real’
Frederick’s of Hollywood, the iconic lingerie brand, has transformed itself from a purveyor of racy garments to a brand that embraces inclusivity, diversity and body positivity. The company, which was founded in 1947, has undergone a radical transformation in recent years to stay relevant in an era when consumers demand more from brands.
The lingerie company was famous for its daring and provocative garments, but as consumer attitudes towards sex and sexuality have shifted, so too have the values of Frederick’s of Hollywood. The company has charted a new course, moving away from the narrow, stereotypical vision of beauty that it once promoted and towards a brand that celebrates all body types and skin tones.
This shift has been driven by a growing awareness that consumers want to see themselves represented in the media they consume, including advertisements and marketing materials for lingerie. Rather than portraying only the thin, young models traditionally associated with lingerie advertising, Frederick’s of Hollywood now features models of all ages, sizes, and backgrounds.
The brand has taken this inclusivity even further by partnering with social media influencers who champion body positivity and self-love. One such influencer is Ashley Graham, a plus-size model and body positivity activist, who has been a vocal critic of the narrow standards of beauty once promoted by the fashion industry. Frederick’s of Hollywood has taken a cue from Graham’s message and adopted a more inclusive approach to its marketing.
The shift towards inclusivity has also extended to the products that Frederick’s of Hollywood offers. The company has expanded its offerings to include a wider range of sizes and styles, including lingerie for post-mastectomy patients, women in menopause, and women with disabilities. The brand is committed to providing high-quality, comfortable lingerie that is designed for women of all shapes, sizes, and needs.
The Frederick’s of Hollywood of today is very different from the brand that was once synonymous with sex and sensuality. The company has evolved to embrace a more inclusive vision of beauty and to celebrate the diversity of women’s bodies. This shift has been driven by a recognition that consumers want authentic representations of women in advertising and in the products they purchase.
By prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, Frederick’s of Hollywood has not only stayed relevant, but it has also become an aspirational brand for women who value self-love, body positivity, and authenticity. The lingerie company has paved the way for other brands to follow suit and demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity and diversity. For Frederick’s of Hollywood, the journey from racy to real has been transformative, and it has created a brand that is more relevant and inspiring than ever before.
