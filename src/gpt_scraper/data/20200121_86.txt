Dear Harry and Meghan,
First and foremost, welcome to Canada! As a country that prides itself on its multiculturalism, we are thrilled to have you join us. We understand that the decision to leave behind your life as senior members of the royal family was not an easy one, and we are here to support you in any way we can.
That being said, we do have some friendly advice to offer as you navigate your new life in Canada. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Embrace the Canadian winter: As you may already know, Canada can get pretty chilly in the winter months. However, don’t let the cold weather deter you from exploring all that our country has to offer during this season. Take up skiing, snowshoeing, or even ice fishing – you might be surprised at how much fun you can have in the snow!


Try our food: Canada has a diverse culinary scene, with everything from poutine (a delicious concoction of fries, gravy, and cheese curds) to butter tarts (a sweet pastry filled with caramelized sugar and butter). Don’t be afraid to try some of our unique dishes – you might just discover a new favorite food.


Respect our culture: Canada has a rich indigenous history and culture, which is an important part of our national identity. Take the time to learn about and respect the traditions of the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples. This includes acknowledging the land on which you reside and the history of the people who have lived there before you.


Enjoy our natural beauty: Canada is home to some of the most breathtaking natural landscapes in the world, from the Rocky Mountains to the Canadian Shield. Take advantage of the opportunity to explore these beautiful places and enjoy the great outdoors.


Give back to the community: Canada is a country that values kindness and generosity. Consider getting involved in local volunteer work or donating to a charity that supports causes you care about. This is a great way to give back to the community and make a positive impact.


We hope that these tips will help you settle into your new life in Canada. We are excited to have you as part of our community and look forward to seeing all the wonderful things you will do in the future. Welcome to Canada!
Sincerely,
The Canadian People
