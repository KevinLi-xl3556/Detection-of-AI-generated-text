In most fields, earning a position or a coveted seat is a true accomplishment. However, when it comes to keeping that position, not everyone is successful. Many people may unknowingly do things that cause them to lose their seat or status over time. In this article, we’ll explore some common ways that people can lose a seat in just 10 years.

Stagnation and Complacency

One of the primary reasons people lose a seat is complacency. Often, once someone has achieved their desired position, they become comfortable and stop growing. They stop taking on new challenges, attending training or courses, and lose their enthusiasm for the job, which leads to being surpassed by others who continue to improve their skills and knowledge.

Burnout

Many individuals who lose their seat might be capable of continuing, but they become overworked, overwhelmed, or burned out by the demands of their position. This results in lower productivity which may cause them to be seen as less valuable, leading to the loss of their seat.

Disrespecting the Rules

Losing one’s seat could be due to flouting guidelines that were established for a member to keep their current status. Disrespecting the rules, subverting authority, or bending the rules are sure-fire ways to lose a seat in a company, organization or a community.

Negativity

Negativity causes an unwelcoming environment which can adversely affect morale, productivity, and team spirit within a company or community. Complaining, being overcritical, and negative vibes can create disagreement and make other people uncomfortable or unhappy, eventually leading to resentment and loss of the coveted seat.

Lack of Networking

We all know that networking is significant for growth and self-improvement. Failing to collaborate or work with others beyond their current circle result in missed opportunities to bring one’s personal capabilities to the recognized attention.

Incompetence

An individual can lose their seat if they fail to provide value to their shareholders or customers. Competence and productivity are vital factors in holding onto a seat, and anyone who fails to deliver or produce the expected results over an extended period will lose their position.

Poor image management

Appearance, reputation, and attitude can also play a vital role in keeping one’s position or status. Poor image management can create negative feedback from clients, customers, or colleagues, which might result in losing the coveted seat.
In conclusion, losing one’s seat or position is not an overnight process. It occurs over time and highlights a failure to adapt, evolve, and overcome, which are all vital for growth and progress. Although these reasons may vary based on different jobs, companies, cultures, and contexts, the factors stated above provide beneficial guidelines for individuals to build on and guarantee their inclusion in any community.
