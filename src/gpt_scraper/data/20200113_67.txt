In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II expressed her support for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family and start a “new life” outside the United Kingdom.
The statement read, “Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family. Harry, Meghan, and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.”
The Queen acknowledged the challenges that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have faced in recent years, including media scrutiny and public scrutiny of their relationship, and she expressed her understanding of their desire to seek greater privacy and autonomy.
“I want to thank them for all their dedicated work across this country, the Commonwealth and beyond, and am particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family,” the statement continued.
The Queen’s statement also made it clear that Harry and Meghan’s decision to step back from royal duties and pursue a new life in North America was not taken lightly. “It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life,” she said.
The statement comes after weeks of negotiations between the palace and the Sussexes, who announced their intention to step back from their royal roles in January 2020. Since then, the couple has moved to North America and launched a number of philanthropic initiatives, including the Archewell Foundation, which focuses on issues like mental health and racial justice.
The Queen’s supportive statement is likely to be welcomed by Harry and Meghan, who have faced criticism and controversy in the British media over the past year. It is also a sign that the royal family is willing to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances and expectations, even as it maintains its core values and traditions.
In recent years, the monarchy has faced challenges to its relevance and authority, as well as criticism for its handling of issues like race and diversity. The Queen’s statement suggests that she is aware of these challenges and is committed to addressing them in a constructive and proactive way.
As Harry and Meghan embark on their “new life,” they will undoubtedly face new challenges and opportunities. But with the Queen’s support, they can be confident that they have the backing of their family and the institution they have chosen to represent.
