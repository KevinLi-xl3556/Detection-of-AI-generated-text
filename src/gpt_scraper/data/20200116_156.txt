As tensions between the United States and Iran continue to rise, the two nations have taken their trolling game to a new level by shifting their battleground to a surprising location - China.
In recent months, both the U.S. and Iran have been making a concerted effort to influence public opinion in the world’s most populous country, using a range of tactics from social media campaigns to state-sponsored propaganda.
The U.S. has been actively promoting its anti-Iranian agenda across Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat, with a particular focus on the country’s young, tech-savvy population. American diplomats have been releasing videos and tweets in Mandarin decrying Iran’s role in fomenting instability in the Middle East and calling for stronger measures to constrain the Islamic Republic.
Iran, for its part, has been using similar tactics to push back against U.S. propaganda efforts. The regime has been promoting its own narrative, claiming that the United States is the primary source of instability in the region and that Iran is simply defending itself against American aggression.
Of course, both sides know that their efforts in China are unlikely to have much of an impact on actual policy. China has largely stayed out of the ongoing conflict between the U.S. and Iran, preferring instead to maintain its position as a neutral observer.
But the real target of this high-stakes trolling game is not the Chinese government or even the Chinese people themselves. Rather, it is the international community.
Both the U.S. and Iran are aware that their actions in China will be closely watched by other countries, particularly those in Europe and Asia. By using China as a proxy battleground, they hope to win support and sympathy from other nations by presenting themselves as the underdogs in a global struggle against each other.
At the same time, both the U.S. and Iran are aware that their messages in China will be subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. China’s strict censorship laws mean that both sides will have to be creative in order to get their messages out without violating the rules.
This has led to some bizarre situations, such as when the U.S. State Department created a meme featuring a cartoon version of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei captioned with the words “Hey Khamenei, Is this your democracy?” The meme was quickly censored by Chinese authorities, but not before it had been widely shared and mocked online.
The trolling game in China is just one example of the increasingly high-stakes propaganda war being waged by the U.S. and Iran. As tensions continue to ratchet up between the two nations, it is likely that we will see more and more unusual tactics being employed in the ongoing struggle for hearts and minds.
