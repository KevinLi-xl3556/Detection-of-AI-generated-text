Choupette, the cat who was once the darling of the fashion world, has been out of the spotlight for some time now. What happened to this famous feline, and where has she been?
For those who may not know, Choupette was the beloved pet of the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. The fluffy white Birman cat became something of a sensation in the fashion world, with her own Instagram account and even a book dedicated to her.
Lagerfeld famously doted on Choupette, referring to her as his “daughter” and once telling French TV show Le Bonheur Est Dans Le Pre that “there is no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals… I never thought that I would fall in love like this with a cat.”
So, what has Choupette been up to since Lagerfeld’s passing in 2019? According to reports, she has been living a luxurious life in Paris under the care of Lagerfeld’s former head of security and now her official caretaker, Françoise Caçote.
In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Caçote revealed that Choupette has a daily routine that includes waking up at 7 a.m., having breakfast, napping, and playing with her toys. She also reportedly has her own personal maid.
While Choupette may not be making as many public appearances as she once did, she is still very much a part of the fashion world. Back in 2020, she even made the cover of Harper’s Bazaar alongside supermodel Gigi Hadid.
Choupette’s future is uncertain, as Lagerfeld did not leave specific instructions for her care in his will. However, it seems that for now, she is living a comfortable and pampered life, surrounded by love and luxury.
In conclusion, while Choupette may not be in the public eye as much as she once was, she is still very much loved and taken care of. Perhaps one day she will return to the spotlight, but for now, she seems content to live a lavish and comfortable life surrounded by those who care for her.
