Greta Gerwig’s latest movie ‘Little Women’ is an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel. However, it’s a retelling that is meant for a new era. This new rendition of ‘Little Women’ focuses on independence, career goals, and their struggles as women.
The film depicts the lives of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, in the aftermath of the Civil War where they grow as individuals and deal with family hardships. Gerwig’s adaptation sends a message of the importance of the aspirations and desires in women’s lives, invariably curtailed by societal norms and family expectations. Gerwig finds a balance between American historical drama and the timeless expression of authenticity in finding one’s voice.
Gerwig’s perspective on a new threshold of women’s liberation is the backbone of the movie. Her adaptation is not trying to mimic the original novel, but rather to create a message relevant to our times. Gerwig stays close to the original source; yet, she manages to let the audience absorb every character depth within a shoestring budget.
Some of the most unorthodox but significant changes that Gerwig made were the order of the events of the novel’s timeline. The movie’s final scenes showing Jo March’s life in New York are some of the best scenes from the contemporary amorphic adaptations of the iconic novel. The movie cleverly uses flashbacks and competing timelines, to help the audience keep the complex story in their heads.
Moreover, the edit allows the audience to fall for the story’s characters – not just the protagonist, Jo. Gerwig did an exceptional job shaping the sisters’ identities, specifically Amy and Beth. Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh played Jo and Amy, respectively, in a breathtakingly unprecedented way. They took on the challenge of portraying Amy’s shift from youthfulness to maturity with such finesse, almost salvaging from the common perception of their audacious young energy.
Furthermore, Gerwig also gave the audience a chance to explore the grandness of background characterization, like the relationship between Marmee (Laura Dern) and father (Bob Odenkirk). While not fully fleshed out, the moment when the father descends from the balcony is an emotionally powerful scene of reunification, proving Gerwig’s adeptness in adding more depth to the background details.
In conclusion, Gerwig’s adaptation of ‘Little Women’ is a film that the world longed for. It is a story of a family of women’s struggles with independence and career goals that resonates more poignantly in light of today’s world events. Gerwig’s rendition showed the compelling power of repeatedly adapting the classics while keeping their essence intact, but also revitalizing them for a millennial audience. This new ‘Little Women’ is essentially a feminist battle cry, and the movie itself serves as evidence that heritage literary works can be just as informative and influential today as they were when first introduced.
