Justin Bieber’s Flavorless Pivot to R&B, and 10 More New Songs
Justin Bieber’s latest album, Justice, sees the pop star continue his journey towards a more mature sound. However, while his attempt to pivot towards R&B may have been well-intentioned, the end result feels largely flavorless. That being said, the album still boasts a number of standout tracks that showcase Bieber’s impressive vocal range and ability to craft catchy melodies. Here are 10 new songs to check out, including a few that manage to outshine the lackluster R&B offerings on Justice.


“Leave The Door Open” by Silk Sonic
The first single from Silk Sonic, the supergroup comprised of Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars, is a masterclass in retro soul. With its funky bassline and smooth vocals, “Leave The Door Open” transports listeners straight to the 70s.


“Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” by Lil Nas X
With its controversial music video and unabashed celebration of queer desire, “Montero” is easily one of the most talked-about songs of the year so far. But beyond the hype, it’s also an irresistibly catchy bop that showcases Lil Nas X’s versatility as an artist.


“We’re Good” by Dua Lipa
Dua Lipa’s latest single is a sly breakup anthem that’s equal parts sarcastic and sweet. The chorus, with its refrain of “we’re good, we’re good, we’re good,” is sure to get stuck in your head.


“Heat Waves” by Glass Animals
British indie band Glass Animals continue their hot streak with “Heat Waves,” a dreamy, melancholic track that’s perfect for late-night drives or rainy day commutes.


“Wants and Needs” by Drake feat. Lil Baby
Drake teams up with rising Atlanta rapper Lil Baby for this hard-hitting track that sees both artists spitting confident bars over a minimalist beat.


“Your Power” by Billie Eilish
The lead single from Billie Eilish’s upcoming album Happier Than Ever, “Your Power” is a haunting ballad that tackles themes of abuse and power dynamics in relationships.


“Good Days” by SZA
After a brief hiatus, SZA returned with “Good Days,” a blissful, jazz-inflected track that sees the singer reflecting on self-love and growth.


“On My Mind” by Diplo & SIDEPIECE
Diplo teams up with DJ duo SIDEPIECE for this infectious dance track that features a catchy vocal hook and a groovy bassline.


“My Universe” by Coldplay & BTS
The unlikely pairing of Coldplay and BTS resulted in this euphoric, multilingual track that celebrates the power of love and connection.


“Without You” by The Kid LAROI
Australian rapper The Kid LAROI’s breakout hit “Without You” is a heartbreaking ballad that showcases the 18-year-old’s raw talent and emotional depth.


While Justice may have fallen short of expectations, there’s no shortage of great new music to explore. From Lil Nas X’s boundary-pushing pop to Glass Animals’ dreamy indie rock, there’s something for every taste on this list.
