Edd Byrnes, a beloved television actor from the 1950s and 1960s, passed away on January 8, 2020, at the age of 86. Byrnes was known for his iconic role as Kookie on the hit TV series “77 Sunset Strip,” which propelled him to stardom.
Born Edward Byrne Breitenberger on July 30, 1932, in New York City, Byrnes grew up in a working-class family. He began his career as a contract player with Warner Bros. in the early 1950s, appearing in small roles in films like “The High and the Mighty” and “Rebel Without a Cause.”
It wasn’t until 1958 that Byrnes landed his breakout role on “77 Sunset Strip,” a detective drama set in Los Angeles. Byrnes played Gerald “Kookie” Kookson III, a hipster parking lot attendant who helped the detectives solve crimes. Kookie was known for his catchphrase, “Baby, you’re the greatest,” and his signature comb, which he used to style his hair. Byrnes’ popularity on the show was so immense that he even released a hit song, “Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb),” which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1959.
After “77 Sunset Strip” ended in 1964, Byrnes continued to act in films and on TV, but he never achieved the same level of success as he did with his Kookie character. He made appearances on shows like “Charlie’s Angels” and “Fantasy Island,” and he also had a recurring role on “Married… with Children” in the late 1980s.
In addition to his acting career, Byrnes was also a talented singer and writer. He wrote an autobiography, “Kookie No More,” in 1996, in which he discussed his rise to fame and his struggles with addiction. Byrnes also released several albums throughout his career, including “Rockin’ and Burnin’” and “Hot Wheels.”
Byrnes’ death was met with an outpouring of love and support from fans and fellow actors alike. Many took to social media to express their condolences and share their favorite memories of Byrnes and his iconic role on “77 Sunset Strip.” Although he may be gone, Byrnes’ legacy will live on through his timeless performances and the countless fans who were inspired by his work.
In conclusion, Edd Byrnes was a talented actor who will be remembered for his iconic role on “77 Sunset Strip” and his contributions to the entertainment industry. He will be greatly missed, but his impact will be felt for generations to come. Rest in peace, Kookie.
