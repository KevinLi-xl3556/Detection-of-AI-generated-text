Tragedy struck the Pennsylvania Turnpike on Sunday in what is being referred to as a “multi-vehicle crash” that left five people dead and 60 others injured, according to officials.
The accident occurred around 3:40 a.m. on Sunday on the turnpike’s westbound lanes in Mount Pleasant Township, located in the southeastern part of the state. The crash involved at least three tractor-trailers, a tour bus and passenger cars as well.
“Out of the multiple patients, 11 were transported by helicopter, and at least 52 others were transported by ambulance to various hospitals,” Westmoreland County Public Safety Department spokesman Dan Stevens said during a press conference on Sunday.
As for the deceased individuals, their identities have yet to be released. It is also unclear at this time the cause of the accident, but officials suspect that the combination of poor weather conditions and high speeds may have played a factor.
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf released a statement on Sunday expressing his condolences for the victims and their families.
“My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives and the dozens of others who were injured in this horrific crash,” said Wolf. “I encourage everyone to join me in the hopes of a complete recovery for the many others who were injured.”
This accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike is just one of many in recent years involving large multi-vehicle crashes. Accidents like this often spark debates about the safety regulations for large vehicles, including 18-wheelers and tour buses.
While investigations into the cause of the crash will continue, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure the safety of those traveling on America’s highways. Our thoughts are with the victims of this tragedy and their families during this difficult time.
