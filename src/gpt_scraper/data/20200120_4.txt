As the world awaits the arrival of the royal couple, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, in Canada, many Canadians are wondering where they will live. Ever since the couple announced their intentions to step away from their roles as senior members of the royal family, much speculation has arisen about their future plans, including where they will reside.
Canada has quickly become a favored choice for the couple, as it allows them to be somewhat removed from the intense media scrutiny that they had previously experienced in the UK while still remaining connected to the Commonwealth. Moreover, Meghan, who spent several years of her life in Canada filming the TV series Suits, has strong ties to the country.
However, the question on everyone’s mind remains: where exactly will they live? Recent reports suggest that they are currently house-hunting in the Greater Victoria area, located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. It is said that the couple is interested in a 10,000 sq. ft. waterfront mansion, which would provide plenty of space for them and their soon-to-be-expanded family.
But why Victoria? It is said that the couple had visited the city previously and enjoyed its laid-back, cosmopolitan vibe, which offers a mix of city and outdoor living. Victoria is known for its beautiful park spaces, high-end restaurants, and stunning views of the Pacific Ocean, making it an ideal place for the couple to settle down and raise their family.
However, others speculate that the couple may also be considering Toronto, where Meghan previously lived and where several of her close friends reside. The city’s vibrant culture and diverse population could make it an attractive choice, and it is also home to several of Canada’s top universities, which could provide educational opportunities for their children in the future.
While the exact location of the couple’s new home remains uncertain, one thing is certain: wherever they end up, they are sure to make a significant impact on their new community. With their charitable work and commitment to making a positive difference, the royals are sure to be welcomed with open arms by Canadians across the country.
In conclusion, the royal couple’s move to Canada is surely exciting news, and it will undoubtedly lead to many positive changes in their lives as well as in the communities that they choose to call home. Whether they choose Victoria, Toronto, or another Canadian city, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are sure to leave a lasting legacy in their new home country.
