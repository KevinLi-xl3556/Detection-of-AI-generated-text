She’s Your Guide to the Sound World of Fluxus
Fluxus is a fascinating and highly influential art movement that emerged in the 1960s. Known for its unconventional approach to art-making, Fluxus challenged traditional artistic practices and pushed the boundaries of what could be considered art. One aspect of Fluxus that often goes overlooked is its engagement with sound. In fact, many Fluxus artists were deeply invested in exploring the sonic possibilities of everyday objects and actions. If you’re interested in learning more about the sound world of Fluxus, then look no further than your guide: me.
First, it’s important to understand the context in which Fluxus emerged. The movement grew out of a post-war climate in which artists were questioning the role of art in society. Many Fluxus artists sought to break down the boundaries between art and life, blurring the distinction between the two. This is where sound comes in. By incorporating sound into their art, Fluxus artists were able to highlight the musicality of everyday life and reframe our understanding of what can be considered aesthetic.
One well-known Fluxus artist who experimented with sound is John Cage. Cage was interested in chance operations and indeterminacy, and his music often incorporated found objects such as radios or traffic sounds. Cage’s composition “4’33”," famously consists of complete silence, forcing the listener to focus on the ambient sounds in the room. This piece exemplifies the Fluxus interest in turning everyday sounds into art.
Another Fluxus artist who explored sound is Nam June Paik. Paik was fascinated by the potential of electronic technology, and his work often incorporated televisions, radios, and other electronic devices. Paik’s piece “TV Bra for Living Sculpture” features a bra made out of two small televisions, one on each cup, playing different channels. The piece is an example of how Fluxus artists sought to create innovative and playful works of art that challenged traditional conventions.
Fluxus also created events where sound was used as a primary mode of expression. These events were called “happenings,” and they often involved musicians, poets, and visual artists collaborating on an improvised performance. The goal was to create an immersive experience for both the artists and the audience, blurring the lines between performer and viewer. Happenings exemplified the Fluxus approach to creating art as a participatory, collective experience.
If you’re interested in exploring the sound world of Fluxus further, there are many resources available. The book “Fluxus Experience” by Hannah Higgins provides an excellent overview of the movement, including its engagement with sound. Other resources include online archives of Fluxus materials and recordings of Fluxus performances.
Fluxus may have emerged over half a century ago, but its influence can still be felt today in contemporary sound art and experimental music. By exploring the sound world of Fluxus, we can gain a greater appreciation for the creative potential of everyday objects and actions. So next time you hear a car honk or a bird chirp, remember that it could be the inspiration for your next Fluxus-inspired sound work.
