In January 2020, the world was rocked by the news of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family. The move, dubbed “Megxit”, was met with a mixture of shock, sympathy, and outrage by people around the globe. But in the UK, the split has highlighted the deep divisions between different age groups and political factions, leading some to compare it to the ongoing Brexit saga.
At its heart, Megxit represents a clash between traditional values and modern priorities. Older generations, particularly those who grew up during a time of British imperial power and glory, view the royal family as a pillar of stability and national pride. They see Harry and Meghan’s decision as a betrayal of that heritage, an abandonment of duty and loyalty.
Younger people, on the other hand, see the couple’s move as a reflection of their own desire for individualism and self-determination. They view the royal family as an antiquated institution, out of touch with modern values and attitudes. For them, Megxit is a symbol of rebellion against the old ways and a rejection of the constraints placed on them by traditional institutions.
Politics enters the equation when we look at the Brexit divide. The EU referendum of 2016 split the country in two, with older, more conservative voters tending to support Leave, while younger, more liberal voters backed Remain. That split has only widened in the years since, with each side becoming increasingly entrenched in its own beliefs.
Megxit has followed a similar pattern. Older, conservative voters have tended to support the royal family and view Harry and Meghan’s move as a betrayal of duty. Younger, more liberal voters have supported the couple and see their decision as a reflection of their desire for independence.
The British media has played a role in exacerbating these divisions. The tabloids have gone after Meghan Markle with a vengeance, painting her as a divisive figure who broke the royal family apart. They have stoked the flames of anger and resentment among older, conservative readers, presenting Megxit as a national crisis.
Meanwhile, younger readers have been drawn to Meghan’s story as a symbol of hope and renewal. They have praised her for standing up against a patriarchal system and forging her own path. They see Megxit as a victory for individualism and a rejection of the old, stodgy ways of the past.
In the end, the split caused by Megxit is similar to the split caused by Brexit in that it is rooted in deep-seated differences in values and priorities. Until those divides are bridged, there will always be tension and conflict in British society. But perhaps, in the long run, the tensions caused by Megxit will ultimately lead to a more open, inclusive, and tolerant country. Only time will tell.
