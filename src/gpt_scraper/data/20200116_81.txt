Campy Horror in Living Color: Why It’s Making a Comeback
In the 1980s, movies like “The Evil Dead” and “Re-Animator” brought the term “campy horror” into the horror lexicon. These movies were low-budget, cheesy, and often employed over-the-top gore and humor. While some critics dismissed these movies as trash, many horror fans embraced them for their unapologetic embrace of the absurd.
But in recent years, campy horror seems to be making a comeback. From the success of the “Sharknado” franchise to the critical acclaim of movies like “Get Out” and “Us,” it seems that audiences are once again hungry for horror that doesn’t take itself too seriously.
So what is it about campy horror that makes it so appealing? For one thing, it’s a refreshing change of pace from the ultra-serious, high-budget horror that dominates the industry. While those movies can certainly be effective, they often feel more like a rollercoaster ride than a movie-going experience. Campy horror, on the other hand, allows us to let our guard down and have some fun with our fear.
There’s also the sense of shared experience that comes with watching campy horror. These movies are meant to be enjoyed with a rowdy crowd, with people shouting at the screen and laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. In an age where it’s easier to watch movies alone at home than to go to the theater, campy horror gives us an excuse to seek out a communal experience.
Of course, there are those who still dismiss campy horror as being beneath serious consideration. But as horror has evolved as a genre, so too has the definition of what constitutes “good” horror. Movies like “Scream” and “Cabin in the Woods” have demonstrated that horror can be both self-aware and effective, challenging our expectations even as they gleefully fulfill them.
For all its silliness, campy horror has something important to say about the human experience. By taking everyday fears and amplifying them to ridiculous extremes, these movies offer a kind of catharsis that is both satisfying and joyful. They remind us that fear is not something to be avoided, but something to be embraced – and that sometimes, the best way to do that is to let out a good scream and laugh at ourselves.
