In a move that has shocked the basketball world, Maya Moore has announced that she will skip another season with the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) to focus on a higher calling - championing the case of a man she believes was wrongfully imprisoned.
For those who may not know, the 30-year-old Moore is a four-time WNBA champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist and considered one of the greatest female basketball players of all time. However, in recent years, she has taken a step back from her playing career to focus on social justice issues.
This year, she’s taking that commitment a step further by intensifying her efforts to see Jonathan Irons walk free after serving more than 20 years in prison for a crime he insists he didn’t commit - burglary and assault with a gun.
With help, Moore has been tirelessly working on Irons’ case for more than a decade, and yet the man still remains behind bars, steadfast in his claims of innocence. Thus, unable to sit on the sidelines any longer, Moore has opted to put her playing career on hold again to devote all her energy to this monumental cause.
For Moore, the decision to skip another season wasn’t an easy one, but she says it’s one she’s at peace with. “My heart is just not in playing at this moment. I’m focusing on investing my time in some ministry dreams that have been stirring in my heart for many years,” she wrote in a statement.
“I’m sure this year will be hard in ways that I don’t even know yet, but it will also be rewarding considering I’ll be paying back some of the debt that’s owed,” she added.
Moore has also been an outspoken advocate for other social justice issues, including the Black Lives Matter movement, addressing police brutality and wrongful arrests, and reforming the criminal justice system. Her activism, particularly in Irons’ case, has shone a light on just how far the criminal justice system needs to come in terms of fairness and justice for all.
In conclusion, Maya Moore’s decision to skip another season to champion a prisoner’s case speaks volumes of her commitment to social justice and her refusal to stand by in the face of injustice. As she puts it, “We have a lot of work to do in this country to get to justice and equity for a lot of marginalized people. I’m wanting to be a part of the solution. Regimes change, policies change, but we need to change as a society.”
