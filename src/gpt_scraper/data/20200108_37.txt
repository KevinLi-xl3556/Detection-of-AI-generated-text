On January 3, 2020, the United States killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, in a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. This move sparked outrage and condemnation from Iran and many other countries. While the immediate consequences of the assassination were significant, the long-term costs of killing Suleimani are still being felt today.
One of the biggest questions that arose following the attack was: how much did killing Suleimani cost the United States? The answer to this question is complicated and depends on how one defines “cost.” In terms of financial cost, the drone strike that killed Suleimani likely cost between $1 million and $10 million, according to various estimates. This figure includes the cost of the drone, the cost of the missile used to kill Suleimani, and the cost of operating the drone.
However, the financial cost is just the tip of the iceberg. The real cost of killing Suleimani is much greater and more far-reaching. For one, the assassination of Suleimani has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran, leading to an increase in the risk of war between the two countries. This increased risk of war has led to increased military spending and deployment of troops in the region, which has in turn led to increased financial costs for the United States.
In addition to the financial costs, the assassination of Suleimani has also had significant geopolitical costs for the United States. The killing of a high-level Iranian official on Iraqi soil without the permission of the Iraqi government has further strained relations between the United States and Iraq. It has also given Iran an excuse to ramp up its own military activities in the region, including attacks on American and coalition forces in Iraq.
Moreover, the assassination of Suleimani has also had a significant impact on US credibility and reputation on the world stage. The United States has long presented itself as a defender of democracy and human rights, but the targeted killing of a high-level Iranian official without due process has undermined that image. This has led to criticism from human rights organizations and many countries around the world.
Finally, the assassination of Suleimani has also had a significant impact on the stability of the Middle East. Suleimani was a key player in Iranian politics and military strategy, and his death has left a power vacuum in Iran that has yet to be filled. This has led to increased instability and uncertainty in the region, which could have long-term consequences for the United States and its allies.
In conclusion, while the financial cost of killing Suleimani was significant, the real costs of this action are much greater and more far-reaching. The assassination has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran, strained relations with Iraq, undermined US credibility and reputation on the world stage, and increased instability in the Middle East. It is clear that the cost of killing Suleimani will continue to be felt for years to come.
