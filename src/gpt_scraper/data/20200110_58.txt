How ‘Just Mercy’ Gets Close to Its Characters
Based on the autobiography of Bryan Stevenson - a lawyer who devoted his life to fighting for wrongly convicted prisoners on death row - “Just Mercy” is a powerful, passionate, and emotional film that captivates its audience with its characters, story, and authenticity. Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, it stars Michael B. Jordan as Stevenson and Jamie Foxx as one of his clients, Walter McMillian.
One of the most striking aspects of the film is its ability to get close to its characters, both as individuals and as members of larger social and political systems. Through a combination of skilled acting, nuanced writing, and careful direction, the film creates a compelling, organic, and empathetic portrait of the people it portrays.
One way the film does this is by centering its narrative on Stevenson’s perspective. As the main character and narrator, he offers a window into the world of death row and the lives of the people who inhabit it. From the opening scene, where he walks through a prison yard and sees the faces of the men he’s trying to save, to the climactic courtroom scene where he argues passionately for McMillian’s innocence, the film shows us the world through Stevenson’s eyes. This immersive approach allows the audience to connect with the characters on an emotional level, understanding their hopes, fears, and struggles through Stevenson’s experiences.
Another way the film gets close to its characters is by giving them depth and nuance. From McMillian, the man who has been wrongfully convicted of murder and spent years on death row, to his family, community, and legal team, each character is given a rich and multifaceted personality. We see their relationships, their flaws, their strengths, and their histories. This attention to detail makes them feel like real people, not just plot devices or archetypes. It also allows us to understand the various social and political forces that have led them to where they are.
Finally, the film gets close to its characters by addressing the systemic issues that surround them. By showing us the corruption, bias, and racism that infect the justice system, the film places the characters in a larger context. It asks us not only to care about these people as individuals but also to see them as victims of a larger system that is flawed and unjust. This approach is powerful because it challenges us not just to empathize with the characters but to take action to change the system that is hurting them.
Overall, “Just Mercy” succeeds in getting close to its characters by using a variety of techniques, all designed to create a sense of empathy and connection. By centering its narrative on Stevenson, giving each character depth and nuance, and addressing the systemic issues that surround them, the film invites us into their lives and asks us to care about their fate. It is a moving and important film that succeeds in its mission to shed light on the injustices of the justice system and the people who suffer because of it.
