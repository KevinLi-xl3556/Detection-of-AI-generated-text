In early 2020, the world was rocked by the news that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, had decided to step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family. This move, dubbed “Megxit” by the media, caused quite a stir both in the UK and around the world.
Since then, speculation has been rife as to what the couple’s future holds. One possibility that has been suggested is that Harry and Meghan may move to Canada, where they spent six weeks over Christmas and New Year’s.
Could “Megxit” be a royal fairy tale for Canada? There are certainly many reasons to believe that it could be.
For one thing, Canada has long been a popular destination for the royals. Queen Elizabeth II has visited the country many times during her long reign, and both Prince William and Prince Harry have spent time there as well.
In addition, Canada is a country that values multiculturalism and diversity, which could be a good fit for the biracial Meghan Markle. The Duchess has also been involved in several charitable endeavors related to women’s issues, which could align well with the feminist values espoused by many Canadians.
But perhaps the biggest reason that “Megxit” could be a fairy tale for Canada is the potential economic benefits. In a recent report, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) estimated that Harry and Meghan’s move could bring in an additional $38 million annually to the Canadian economy.
This would come from a variety of sources, including increased tourism to Canada, as well as the potential for the couple to launch their own brand and merchandise. In addition, Harry and Meghan could choose to get involved in Canadian causes and charities, which could help to boost fundraising efforts.
Of course, there are some potential downsides to the “Megxit” fairy tale as well. For one thing, the couple’s security could be an issue, as they would likely need around-the-clock protection given their high profile.
In addition, there could be some backlash from those who feel that the royals shouldn’t be “outsourcing” their duties to another country. However, it’s worth noting that Harry and Meghan have stated that they intend to continue their royal duties in some capacity, even if they are no longer full-time working royals.
All in all, though, there are many reasons to believe that “Megxit” could be a royal fairy tale for Canada. From potential economic benefits to a shared commitment to diversity and charitable causes, it’s clear that there could be many positive outcomes from Harry and Meghan’s move. Only time will tell what the future holds, but the potential for a happy ending is certainly there.
