Val Demings: Impeachment Manager Offers Law Enforcement Experience
Val Demings, the U.S. House Representative from Florida’s 10th Congressional District, is a prominent member of the Democratic Party who was selected as an Impeachment Manager for the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in 2021. Demings, a former police chief, offers a unique perspective to the impeachment trial with her law enforcement experience.
Born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida, Demings began her career in law enforcement in the Orlando Police Department (OPD) in 1983. She rose through the ranks over the course of a 27-year career and was named the first female chief of the department in 2007. As chief, she was responsible for leading 800 police officers and 300 civilian employees in the city of Orlando.
Demings’ tenure as chief was marked by a reduction in crime and a focus on community policing. She was also committed to ensuring transparency and accountability in the OPD, instituting regular audits of the department’s practices and increasing the use of body cameras by officers.
Following her retirement from the OPD in 2011, Demings ran for the U.S. House of Representatives and was elected in 2017. In Congress, she has used her law enforcement experience to advocate for gun control measures, police reform, and criminal justice reform. She has also been a vocal opponent of former President Trump’s policies and rhetoric on immigration and has pushed for comprehensive immigration reform.
As an Impeachment Manager in the second impeachment trial of former President Trump, Demings offered a unique perspective to the proceedings. She drew on her law enforcement experience to argue that the former president’s actions on January 6, 2021, constituted incitement of insurrection and that he should be held accountable for his role in the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Demings’ role in the impeachment trial highlighted the importance of having diverse perspectives and experiences in government. Her background as a law enforcement officer lent credibility to her arguments and showed the importance of upholding the rule of law and accountability. It also demonstrated the potential for members of Congress to draw on their professional experiences to inform their work in government.
