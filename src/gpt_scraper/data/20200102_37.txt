In the world of business and finance, Carlos Ghosn was a household name. As the former CEO of Nissan and Renault, he was known for his remarkable turnaround of both companies and his aggressive management style. However, in 2018, Ghosn’s name began to appear in headlines for a completely different reason - his dramatic escape from Japan, where he was facing charges of financial misconduct. But before that, Ghosn flirted with the idea of a Hollywood career, which ultimately added to the plot twist that was his life.
Ghosn’s flirtation with Hollywood started in 2016 when he was approached by producers to turn his life story into a movie. The film would have been titled “Collision Course” and would have depicted Ghosn’s rise to the top of the automotive industry and the challenges he faced along the way. The project was being developed by producers Michael Costigan and Margot Robbie, with Ghosn himself serving as a consultant.
At the time, Ghosn was still CEO of Nissan and Renault, and the proposed film was seen as a way to further cement his status as a global business icon. However, things took a turn in 2018 when Ghosn was arrested in Japan on charges of financial misconduct. The charges alleged that Ghosn had underreported his income and used company funds for personal expenses.
As Ghosn’s legal battle played out in Japan, the Hollywood project was put on hold. But then, in a plot twist that would have been worthy of a movie, Ghosn made a daring escape from Japan in December 2019. Ghosn reportedly fled the country hidden in a musical instrument case, and eventually made his way to Lebanon, where he remains a fugitive from Japanese justice.
The dramatic turn of events put Ghosn’s Hollywood aspirations back in the spotlight. In an interview with The New York Times, Ghosn revealed that the movie project was still in development, and that he was in talks with a new team of producers to bring the film to fruition. Ghosn also hinted that the movie would tell the story of his escape from Japan, making it a true Hollywood blockbuster.
Of course, there are still many unanswered questions about Ghosn’s legal troubles and his escape from Japan. But for now, it seems that his flirtation with Hollywood is far from over. And whether or not the movie ever makes it to the big screen, Ghosn’s incredible story will continue to fascinate audiences around the world.
