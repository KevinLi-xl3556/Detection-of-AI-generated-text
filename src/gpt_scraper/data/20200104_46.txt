Low Rates, Cheap Gas and Deeper Debt Sustain Car Buying Boom
In recent years, car sales have been on a steady rise in the US, with 2019 being marked by a five percent increase in sales compared to the previous year. This is largely due to low-interest rates, affordable gasoline, and a strong economy. However, it’s also worth questioning whether the continuation of such a boom is sustainable, given the recent increase in consumer debt.
With interest rates at record lows, it has become easier for individuals to access car loans without breaking the bank. The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates low has encouraged more people to buy cars and other big-ticket items, viewed as a sign of faith in the US economy.
Still, the decision to buy a car today despite low interest rates comes with hidden risks, particularly for those who are rolling over debts from previous loans. According to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, around 7 million Americans are three months or more behind on their millennial debt.
Despite the nation’s deepening pile of debt, consumers are still borrowing from internet lenders and justifying their car purchases with payments they can’t reasonably make on time. While low-interest rates can make it affordable to put down monthly car payments, buyers must consider if the repayment term is realistic for them, especially if they’re rolling over old vehicle loans or other forms of personal debt.
But low-interest rates are only one factor driving the car sales boom – the other is cheap gasoline. With the national average price of gasoline currently around $2.20 per gallon, driving has never been more affordable.  This makes it less expensive to take longer trips and run errands, maintaining the popularity of SUVs and pickup trucks.
However, the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic popularized remote working, which means fewer people travel long distances. If this trend continues, it may start to subdue the sale of bigger vehicles, which could result in a decline in overall car sales.
In conclusion, the low-interest rates and cheap gasoline prices have created an opportunity for millions of Americans to buy a car that they previously might not have been able to afford. While this situation has benefited many, it has also given rise to an increase in consumer debt that could have long-term consequences on the financial stability of individuals and the nation as a whole. Therefore car buyers must be aware of payment terms and assess where they stand financially before taking the plunge.
