Ten years ago, the Academy Awards underwent a dramatic change in their approach to selecting Best Picture nominees. Instead of simply nominating five films, as had been the tradition for decades, they expanded the field to include up to 10 films each year. This was a bold move, and one that many believed would dilute the prestige of the award. However, now, a decade later, it is clear that this Oscar experiment actually worked.
The idea behind the expansion was to include a wider range of films in the conversation, and to give smaller, independent films a better chance at recognition. Each year, the Academy invites its members to vote on their preferred nominees, and those with the most votes are selected. By offering more slots for nominations, they open up the possibilities and reduce the likelihood of snubs.
At first, there was concern that this would lead to a watering down of the Best Picture category, with mediocre films earning nominations simply because there were more spots available. However, over the past decade, we have seen some truly exceptional films recognized. Movies like “Moonlight,” “The Shape of Water,” and “Parasite” might have been left out of the conversation entirely under the old system, but with more spots available, they were given the chance to shine.
The expanded field has also led to an increase in diversity among the films recognized. In recent years, we have seen a greater number of films from cultures around the world, as well as more films featuring diverse casts and stories. This not only reflects the changing landscape of Hollywood but also makes the awards more relevant and inclusive.
Of course, the Academy’s experiment has not been without its controversies. With more nominations comes more competition, and some films have been left out of the conversation entirely. Additionally, the Academy has been criticized for the lack of diversity among its members, which can impact the films recognized and the likelihood of smaller, independent films earning nominations.
Overall, however, the expansion of the Best Picture category has been a successful experiment. It has given more films the chance to be recognized, introduced audiences to a wider range of stories and voices, and made the Oscars a more exciting and relevant event. As we look back on the past decade of Oscar history, we can see that this change has been a positive one, and we can’t wait to see what new films will be recognized in the years to come.
