One of the most iconic cars in cinema history is heading to auction: the 1968 Ford Mustang GT driven by Steve McQueen in the classic film “Bullitt.” The car, which has been in private hands since the late 1970s, is expected to fetch a price of at least $3.5 million when it goes up for auction in the coming months.
The car’s appearance in “Bullitt” is legendary. McQueen played a San Francisco police detective named Frank Bullitt, who drives the Mustang in a thrilling car chase through the city’s streets. The scene, which was shot without any special effects or stunt doubles, is widely regarded as one of the greatest car chases in cinema history.
After filming wrapped, the Mustang disappeared for decades, with many car enthusiasts speculating on its whereabouts. In 2018, the car resurfaced when its current owner, Sean Kiernan, announced that he would be putting it up for auction.
Kiernan’s father, Robert, had bought the car in 1974 for $6,000, and it had been sitting in the family’s garage ever since. Robert Kiernan had been a big fan of McQueen and “Bullitt,” and had bought the car as a daily driver. Over the years, he had turned down multiple offers to sell the car, including one from McQueen himself.
When Robert Kiernan passed away in 2014, the car passed to his son, Sean, who initially wasn’t sure what to do with it. But after attending a car show in 2018 and seeing the excitement that the Mustang generated among fans, Sean decided that it was time to share the car with the world.
The Mustang has since been restored to its original condition, with all of the wear and tear of its years in the Kiernan family garage carefully preserved. The car still bears the scars of the many modifications that were made to it for the “Bullitt” chase scene, including holes drilled in the trunk for camera mounts and a custom suspension system.
The car is set to go up for auction in the coming months, with many car enthusiasts eagerly awaiting the chance to own a piece of cinema history. It’s impossible to say exactly how much the Mustang will sell for, but given its unique place in the annals of cinema, it’s sure to command a hefty price tag.
For Sean Kiernan, the decision to sell the car wasn’t an easy one. But he says that he’s happy that the Mustang will soon be in the hands of someone who will appreciate it as much as he and his family have.
“It’s been a great privilege to own this car and be part of its history,” he says. “But it’s time for someone else to take the wheel and write the next chapter.”
