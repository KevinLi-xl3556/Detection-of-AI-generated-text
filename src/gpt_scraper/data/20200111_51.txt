As the 2024 US presidential race heats up, Democratic contenders Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are already positioning themselves to dominate in the early primary states. Both men have a strong base of support and are seen as viable candidates to challenge the Republican incumbent. But what sets them apart, and what strategies will they use to win over voters?
Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, gained a massive following in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primaries. He is known for his progressive policies, including Medicare for All, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage. Sanders has already begun campaigning in early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, where his brand of populist economics and social justice resonates with many voters.
Joe Biden, on the other hand, is a seasoned politician with decades of experience in government. He served as Barack Obama’s vice president from 2009 to 2017 and has since remained a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. Biden is seen as a more moderate candidate, and his policies reflect that. He has advocated for a public option in healthcare, a middle-class tax cut, and a more pragmatic approach to climate change.
So how will these two candidates distinguish themselves from each other in the early states? For Sanders, the key will be to energize his base and expand his appeal beyond the young, progressive voters who propelled him to prominence in 2016. He will need to convince older voters, African Americans, and Latinos that his policies are not only idealistic but also practical and achievable. Sanders has already started reaching out to these groups, holding town halls and rallies in cities with large minority populations.
For Biden, the challenge will be to convince voters that he is the best candidate to defeat the Republican incumbent. He will need to emphasize his experience and electability while also presenting a vision for the future that is more inspiring than that of his opponent. Biden has already begun making the case that he is the best candidate to unify the country and restore America’s standing in the world.
Both Sanders and Biden will also need to contend with a crowded field of other Democratic contenders, many of whom are also targeting the early primary states. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, is seen as a potential threat to Sanders’ base of support, while Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is positioning himself as a more centrist alternative to Biden.
Ultimately, the early primary states will play a crucial role in determining who emerges as the Democratic nominee for president. Sanders and Biden will need to put in the work to win over voters and build momentum before the race moves on to the larger, more diverse states. With their respective strengths and weaknesses, both men have a fighting chance to come out on top.
