When Are You Really an Adult?
The question of when someone truly becomes an adult has been discussed for years. Some people believe that turning 18 or 21 signifies adulthood, while others argue that it’s based on one’s level of responsibility or life experiences. So, when are you really an adult?
The legal age of majority varies from country to country, but it’s mostly around 18 years old. This is the age when people can vote, purchase tobacco, and join the military. By the law, this is when a person becomes responsible legally.
However, turning 18 or 21 does not automatically make someone an adult. Nowadays, many people live with their parents well into their twenties, and some parents continue to support their children financially and in other ways. Living under the care of someone else, you can’t call this person a fully independent and responsible adult.
Responsibility is a significant factor in determining when someone is an adult. Being responsible means that you can take care of yourself and make decisions that affect your life without relying on others to do things for you. This means taking care of personal duties such as paying bills, managing finances, and managing personal decisions.
Another factor to consider when determining if someone is an adult is life experiences. Have they had enough life experience to understand who they are and what they want out of life? Have they been able to navigate challenging situations on their own, without the assistance of others?
In conclusion, determining when someone is an adult is subjective and varies from person to person. It depends on several factors, such as responsibility, independence, and life experiences. Turning 18 or 21 may signify legality, but true adulthood comes with personal responsibility and life experiences. It is a long-run process that everyone experiences differently, but the sooner someone can become self-reliant, the greater the likelihood that they are growing into a successful adult.
