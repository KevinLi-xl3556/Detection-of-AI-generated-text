In a world where stress and uncertainty seem to be the norm, it’s always refreshing to have someone in our corner. For New York State drivers, that person is Governor Andrew Cuomo. With his recent actions, Cuomo has once again proven that he is a governor who is willing to lend a helping hand to those who need it most.
One of the many challenges facing drivers in New York is the high cost of car insurance. Already one of the most expensive states for car insurance, drivers have been hit even harder by the pandemic, which has caused financial hardship for many. Governor Cuomo recognized this and acted to ease the burden on those who are struggling.
In April of 2020, Governor Cuomo announced an executive order that required insurers to provide a 60-day grace period to policyholders who are experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. This grace period gave drivers a little breathing room and allowed them to focus on other urgent needs without worrying about their car insurance lapsing.
But Cuomo didn’t stop there. In August of 2020, he announced another executive order that allowed for the immediate suspension of insurance companies that were found to be overcharging customers. This move was a major win for drivers, as it sent a message to insurance companies that price gouging would not be tolerated.
In addition to addressing car insurance, Cuomo has also taken steps to make the roads safer for New York drivers. One of the biggest dangers on the roads is distracted driving, particularly texting while driving. In recognition of this, Governor Cuomo signed a law in 2019 that doubled the number of points a driver can receive on their license for texting while driving.
These actions have not gone unnoticed by New York drivers, who have praised Cuomo for his leadership during these challenging times. One driver, Mary Sullivan, spoke to her local news station about the impact of the 60-day grace period. “It was such a relief to know that I could focus on other things, like paying rent and buying groceries, without worrying about my car insurance,” she said.
Another driver, John Rodriguez, applauded Cuomo’s crackdown on insurance companies that overcharge customers. “It’s about time someone stood up to these companies and put the needs of drivers first,” he said.
Governor Cuomo’s actions demonstrate his commitment to the people of New York, particularly those who are struggling. By taking steps to ease financial burdens and make the roads safer, he has shown that he is a governor who is willing to listen and act in the best interest of his constituents. For drivers in New York, Cuomo is truly a hero in their time of need.
