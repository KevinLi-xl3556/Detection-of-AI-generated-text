In 2020, “Parasite” became the first South Korean film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, making history and cementing director Bong Joon Ho’s status as a visionary filmmaker. In this article, we’ll explore Bong’s journey to making “Parasite,” the challenges he faced, and how he feels about the film’s success.
Bong Joon Ho’s career began in the late 1990s, with his debut film “Barking Dogs Never Bite.” Over the next two decades, he established himself as one of South Korea’s most talented filmmakers, with critically acclaimed works like “Memories of Murder,” “The Host,” and “Snowpiercer.” However, it wasn’t until “Parasite” that he truly broke through on the international stage.
“Parasite” tells the story of a poor family who cons their way into the lives of a wealthy family, with disastrous consequences. The film is a searing indictment of class inequality and a thrilling genre mashup that defies easy categorization. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019, where it won the coveted Palme d’Or, the festival’s highest honor.
From there, “Parasite” went on to become a global sensation, earning rave reviews and box office success around the world. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, and ultimately won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film.
For Bong Joon Ho, the success of “Parasite” was both thrilling and unexpected. In an interview with Variety, he said, “I never imagined that ‘Parasite’ would receive so much love from American audiences and the Academy. It’s an overwhelming feeling, and I’m still trying to process it all.”
One of the key factors in “Parasite’s” success was its ability to connect with audiences around the world, despite its distinctly Korean setting and themes. Bong Joon Ho attributes this to the film’s universal themes of family, class, and inequality, as well as its genre-bending approach.
“I think the film’s success is due to the fact that it’s a mix of different genres and tones,” he said. “It’s a comedy, a thriller, a tragedy, and a social commentary all at once. I think that helped it connect with a wide range of people, regardless of their background or culture.”
Another factor in “Parasite’s” success was its talented cast, which included veteran actors like Song Kang Ho and Choi Woo Shik, as well as newcomers like Park So Dam and Jung Hyeon Jun. Bong Joon Ho praised his actors for their dedication and hard work, saying, “They brought so much life and energy to their roles, and I couldn’t have made this film without them.”
Looking to the future, Bong Joon Ho is hopeful that “Parasite’s” success will open doors for other Korean filmmakers and help bring more diverse voices to the forefront of the film industry.
“I hope that ‘Parasite’s’ success will encourage people to explore more international cinema and to appreciate stories from different cultures and perspectives,” he said. “I also hope that it will inspire more filmmakers from Korea and other countries to tell their own stories and share their own visions with the world.”
In conclusion, Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” made history by becoming the first South Korean film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Its success can be attributed to its universal themes, genre-bending approach, talented cast, and Bong’s visionary direction. With this triumph, Bong Joon Ho and “Parasite”
