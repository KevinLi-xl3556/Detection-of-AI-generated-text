In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the world woke up to the news that Iran had launched a missile strike on two US military bases in Iraq. The attack was retaliation for the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who was targeted by a US drone strike in Baghdad on January 3rd.
Initial reports suggested that the missile strike had caused minimal damage, with no reported casualties on either side. However, as more information has emerged, it appears that the damage caused by the attack may be more significant than first thought.
Satellite images of the bases show that several buildings were hit by the missiles, including an aircraft hangar and a helicopter landing pad. The images also show that at least five craters were created by the impact of the missiles, with some of them measuring up to 30 feet wide.
While it appears that the missile strike did not cause any fatalities, it has certainly caused damage to US military infrastructure. However, the limited nature of the damage suggests that Iran may not have intended to inflict significant harm on the US forces stationed in Iraq.
Instead, it is possible that the missile strike was designed as a symbolic gesture, aimed at demonstrating Iran’s military capabilities and its willingness to stand up to the United States. The fact that Iran gave advance warning of the attack to Iraqi officials, who then passed the information on to the US military, also suggests that the primary objective was not to cause casualties.
However, just because the missile strike did not cause significant damage does not mean that Iran’s retaliation is over. In fact, some experts are warning that the attack could be just the beginning of a larger confrontation between Iran and the United States.
One reason for this is that Iran has a range of other options available to it if it wishes to escalate the conflict. For example, Iran could launch cyber attacks on US infrastructure or target US interests in other parts of the world.
Iran could also choose to resume its nuclear program, which it scaled back as part of the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers. The killing of Soleimani and the subsequent missile strike have led to increased tensions between Iran and the US, with some analysts warning that the nuclear deal could be in jeopardy.
Another factor to consider is that the missile strike may have unintended consequences. While the attack did not cause any US casualties, it has increased the risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East. The US has already responded by announcing additional economic sanctions on Iran, which could further escalate the situation.
In conclusion, while the missile strike on US military bases in Iraq may not have caused significant damage, it is clear that Iran is not done retaliating for the killing of Soleimani. The limited nature of the damage suggests that Iran’s primary objective was symbolic, but there are concerns that the conflict could escalate further. As tensions continue to rise between Iran and the United States, the world watches with bated breath to see what happens next.
