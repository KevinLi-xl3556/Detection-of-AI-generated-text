On Tuesday, February 9th, 2021, the second impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump began. The proceedings were historic, as Trump became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. Many were eager to hear the arguments put forth by both sides, as well as witness the trial’s overall tone and approach.
In this article, we’ll highlight some of the key moments of Tuesday’s trial and what they could mean for the future of the trial.
Senate Votes on Trial’s Constitutionality
Prior to the trial’s opening arguments, the Senate voted on the constitutionality of trying Trump as a former president. At the heart of this debate was whether a former president can be impeached and convicted by the Senate. In the end, the Senate voted 56-44 in favor of proceeding with the trial, with six Republican senators joining all 50 Democrats in voting in favor.
House Managers Present Case Against Trump
After the Senate’s vote, the House managers presented their case against Trump. They played a 13-minute video compilation of clips that showed the violence and destruction that took place at the Capitol on January 6. The video also included footage of President Trump, who was accused of inciting the insurrection.
Lead House Manager Jamie Raskin argued that Trump’s use of “the big lie” (the notion that the election was stolen from him) and his calls for his supporters to come to Washington D.C. to “stop the steal” led to the deadly attack.
Trump’s Defense Offers Counterarguments
Following the House managers’ presentation, Trump’s defense team presented their counterarguments. They argued that the trial was unconstitutional and that Trump’s speech on January 6 was protected under the First Amendment. They also cited Democrats’ past use of fiery rhetoric, seeking to portray their own side as hypocrites for charging Trump with incitement.
Trump defense attorney David Schoen presented clips of Maxine Waters and other Democratic leaders encouraging peaceful protests following the death of George Floyd. He argued that they were guilty of similar incitement rhetoric as Trump.
Highlights From Day 1 and What to Expect
The first day of the trial set the tone for what could be a contentious trial with passionate arguments on both sides. Democrats have argued that Trump’s words and actions directly led to the insurrection, while Republicans claimed that the former president’s speech was legally protected.
Day two of the trial, which took place on Wednesday, February 10th, will see House Democrats continue to make their case against Trump. Some potential witnesses could include Pence, who was targeted by the violent mob, and other members of Trump’s administration.
Overall, the trial will likely continue to be a political battle between Democrats and Republicans, with the main question being whether or not Trump’s actions should be deemed impeachable. Regardless of the final outcome, the proceedings will serve as a reminder of the unprecedented events that took place on January 6 and the deep divisions that currently exist in American politics.
