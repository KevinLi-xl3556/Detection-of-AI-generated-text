The National Archives has issued an apology after it emerged that one of its photographs of the 2017 Women’s March had been edited to remove criticism of US President Donald Trump.
The photograph in question was taken by independent freelance photographer Mario Tama, and showed a section of the march where protesters held signs protesting Trump’s inauguration. However, when the National Archives displayed the photo in an exhibition on the women’s suffrage movement, the signs had been blurred out, erasing the critical message.
The National Archives admitted that while it occasionally makes edits to photographs for the purpose of preservation, altering the content of a photograph in this way was not appropriate.
In a statement, the National Archives said:
“We made a mistake, and we apologize. We take our commitment to accurately and fully document our holdings very seriously, and we are taking immediate steps to ensure that this never happens again. We have removed the altered image from display, and we will be reviewing all of our procedures for the digitization and display of our holdings in order to prevent any further changes to our historical records.”
The controversy has drawn attention to the importance of accurate documentation and preservation of historical records. The National Archives is responsible for maintaining and providing access to millions of documents, photographs, and other materials that offer a window into the past. As such, it has a duty to ensure that these materials are presented truthfully and with integrity.
This incident underlines the risks associated with digital imaging and editing techniques, which can allow for the manipulation of photographic evidence. While edits to photographs may sometimes be necessary for preservation purposes, it is crucial that any such edits are made transparently and with full disclosure.
The National Archives has pledged to conduct a review of its digitization procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future. In the meantime, this incident highlights the need for a renewed commitment to the preservation of our historical heritage and the importance of upholding the integrity of our historical records.
