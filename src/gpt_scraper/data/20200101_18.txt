On November 26, 2019, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Albania, causing widespread devastation and claiming 51 lives. The disaster revealed a harsh truth about the Balkans: despite being situated in one of the most seismically active regions of Europe, the region is not prepared for a major earthquake. The lesson of the Albanian earthquake is clear - the Balkans aren’t ready for the big one.
Seismic activity is a fact of life in the Balkans. The region sits at the intersection of two major tectonic plates, the Eurasian and the African, and is crisscrossed by a network of active faults. In recent decades, the region has experienced numerous earthquakes, with devastating consequences. In 1979, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit Montenegro, killing over 100 people. In 1999, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck western Turkey, causing widespread damage and claiming more than 17,000 lives. And in 2010, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Serbia, killing two and injuring over 200.
Despite this history, the Balkans have been slow to invest in earthquake preparedness. Infrastructure and buildings are often poorly constructed and not designed to withstand seismic activity. Many buildings in the region are built without proper reinforcement, and are at risk of collapsing in the event of a major earthquake. Additionally, emergency response systems are often inadequate, and there is a lack of coordination between countries in the region.
The consequences of this lack of preparedness were starkly illustrated in the aftermath of the Albanian earthquake. Buildings collapsed, trapping people inside, while emergency responders struggled to reach those in need. Thousands were left homeless, and the country faced a long and difficult road to recovery.
The Albanian earthquake was a wake-up call for the Balkans. It highlighted the urgent need for investment in earthquake preparedness, both in terms of infrastructure and emergency response systems. It also demonstrated the importance of regional cooperation in preparing for and responding to natural disasters.
Fortunately, there are signs that the lesson of the Albanian earthquake has been taken to heart. In the aftermath of the disaster, the international community stepped in to provide support, while regional leaders pledged to work together to improve earthquake preparedness. The European Union announced plans to invest in earthquake-resistant infrastructure in the region, while the United Nations Development Programme launched a program to improve earthquake preparedness and response in Albania.
However, much more needs to be done. The Balkans remain at high risk of a major earthquake, and the consequences of such a disaster could be catastrophic. It is essential that countries in the region continue to invest in earthquake preparedness, and work together to develop coordinated response plans. This will require sustained political will and investment over the long term.
The lesson of the Albanian earthquake is clear - the Balkans aren’t ready for the big one. But with the right investments and a commitment to regional cooperation, the region can become better prepared for the seismic activity that is an inevitable part of life in the Balkans. By learning from the lessons of the past, and taking action to prepare for the future, the region can build resilience and protect the lives and livelihoods of its people.
