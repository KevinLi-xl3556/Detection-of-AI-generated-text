The Last of New York’s Black Cowboys
New York City is known for its abundance of cultural diversity, but many are unaware of the legacy of black cowboys that thrived in the early 20th century. These cowboys were a critical part of NYC’s history, but today, only a few remain.
At the heart of this story is a man named Gerard “Cowboy” Wilson, who is one of the last remaining black cowboys in New York City. Born and raised in Queens, Cowboy has dedicated his entire life to preserving the legacy of black cowboys and keeping their story alive.
Cowboy’s love for cowboys began when he was a child, spending countless hours watching western movies and dreaming of one day riding a horse in his own cowboy hat. As he grew older, Cowboy realized that his passion for cowboys was more than just a dream, and he started to immerse himself in cowboy culture.
He began by joining a local black cowboy riding club called the Federation of Black Cowboys, which was founded in 1973 to keep the tradition and culture of black cowboys alive. He has since become a mentor to younger members of the club, dedicating his time and energy to teaching them the values of hard work, perseverance, and respect, all central components to cowboy culture.
However, the legacy of black cowboys goes beyond simply riding horses in the city. These cowboys were once instrumental in building the city’s infrastructure, herding cattle and horses through the streets to transport goods to and from the docks in Manhattan. Despite the brutality towards black people during that period, they still managed to thrive in this industry and become an essential part of the city’s history.
In 1999, Cowboy and the Federation of Black Cowboys experienced a surge in popularity after participating in Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, where they received a standing ovation from the crowds. This moment brought the group into the limelight, allowing them to propel their cultural mission forward and continue to bring attention to the legacy of black cowboys in New York City.
Today, Cowboy is one of the last remaining members of the old guard and continues to preserve the legacy of black cowboys in New York City in the hopes that future generations will be able to understand and appreciate the contribution of black cowboys.
As Cowboy says, “Our contribution to this city is unmatched, not even to be mentioned. We made something out of nothing. We prove hard work pays off.” The legacy of black cowboys may be dwindling, but with Cowboy’s commitment to passing down his knowledge to the younger generation, it will never be forgotten.
