Here’s the recipe for the Mocha Almond Cake:
Ingredients:

1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar
4 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 cup chopped almonds

For the Mocha Frosting:

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup chopped almonds (for garnish)

Instructions:


Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.


In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.


In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.


In a separate bowl, whisk together the cooled coffee and milk.


Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the coffee-milk mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.


Fold in the chopped almonds.


Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula.


Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.


Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool completely.


While the cakes are cooling, prepare the Mocha Frosting. In a large mixing bowl, sift the cocoa powder to remove any lumps. Add the softened butter, powdered sugar, cooled coffee, and vanilla extract. Beat until creamy and smooth.


Once the cakes are completely cooled, spread a layer of the Mocha Frosting on top of one cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top and spread a thin layer of frosting all over the cake to create a “crumb coat.” This will help to seal in the crumbs and create a smooth surface for the final frosting.


Spread a thick layer of frosting on top of the crumb coat and around the sides of the cake. Use a spatula or a bench scraper to smooth the frosting and create a clean finish.
