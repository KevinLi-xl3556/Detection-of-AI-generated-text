The importance of music education in schools cannot be stated enough, and the Lewis Prize recognizes that fact. The Lewis Prize Awards have just given $1.75 million to organizations that support music education in young communities across the United States.
Music education is an essential part of the curriculum for many schools, as it fosters creativity, cooperativeness, and promotes mental development. It helps in building self-esteem and also helps students to excel in academics. Unfortunately, music education programs have been underfunded and cut from many schools, depriving students of an important part of their education and growth.
The Lewis Prize Awards aim to change this situation. Established in 2018, the Lewis Prize is dedicated to developing young communities through music. The organization identifies leading organizations working in the music field, supporting their efforts by providing them with grants and significant resources.
For the 2021 cycle, the Lewis Prize has awarded seven organizations representing different regions and programs, the whole of $1.75 million. Each organization will receive a share of the grant, ranging from $50,000 to $500,000.
The seven organizations that received the grants this year are: Amp Up NYC, Carnegie Hall’s Weill Music Institute, Chicago Sinfonietta, Crescendo Detroit, Guitars Over Guns, Inc., Highlander Institute, and Urban Voices Project. These organizations are dedicated to shaping the music education system and enhancing the skills of young students throughout the country.
The Lewis Prize recognizes that music education is critical and needed for the holistic development of students in the United States, and these grants will go a long way towards bridging the gaps in funding and resources that exist in music education programs. By investing in young students’ education, the Lewis Prize is ensuring that they have access to the type of creative and positive learning environments that enable them to excel in all areas of life.
The importance of music education cannot be overstated. It is crucial for young students to develop their creativity and critical thinking, and this can be achieved through programs that are dedicated to music education. The Lewis Prize Awards have made a significant contribution to the music education program, ensuring that more communities have access to musical training and resources that will allow them to flourish.
