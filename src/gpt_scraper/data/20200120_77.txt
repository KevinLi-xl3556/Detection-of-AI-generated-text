The Sundance Film Festival, the renowned annual gathering of independent filmmakers and cinema enthusiasts, has a new player in town this year - and she’s backed by none other than Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire businesswoman and philanthropist.
Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, has been making waves in the film industry in recent years through her company, Emerson Collective, which invests in a range of projects spanning education, journalism, and the arts. Now, Emerson Collective is making a splash at Sundance with the premiere of its first feature film, which focuses on a timely and provocative subject: immigration.
Titled “The Infiltrators”, the film tells the true story of a group of young activists who infiltrate a Florida detention center to help free undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation. Directed by Alex Rivera and Cristina Ibarra, the film blends documentary-style footage with scripted scenes to bring a gritty reality to the screen.
The film has already generated significant buzz in the lead-up to Sundance, where it will compete in the US Dramatic Competition category. And with Powell Jobs’ backing, it’s sure to attract even more attention once it premieres.
Powell Jobs has been a long-time supporter of social justice causes and is known for her commitment to using her wealth to effect positive change. She founded Emerson Collective in 2016 as a vehicle for investing in mission-driven initiatives, and the organization has since taken on a range of cutting-edge projects.
At the intersection of media and social impact, Emerson Collective has also got into the documentary filmmaking space with its production of “He Named Me Malala,” which premiered at TIFF in 2015, and “CRIES FROM SYRIA”, which aired on HBO in 2017.
“The Infiltrators” represents a new chapter for Emerson Collective, as the company moves into feature film production. The film provides a powerful platform for exploring one of the most pressing issues of our time - immigration - and doing so in a way that is emotionally compelling and thought-provoking.
Audiences at Sundance will undoubtedly be drawn to the film for its combination of gripping storytelling and timely subject matter. But they will also be keeping a close eye on Powell Jobs and her growing influence in the film industry. With more projects on the horizon, it seems likely that Powell Jobs and Emerson Collective will continue to make waves in the world of cinema for years to come.
