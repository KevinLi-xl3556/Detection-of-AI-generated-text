House Democrats Push Environmental Bills, but Victories Are Few
As concerns about climate change continue to mount, House Democrats have been pushing a slate of environmental bills aimed at addressing the crisis. However, despite their best efforts, victories have been few and far between. Here’s a look at what the Democrats have been doing and why they’ve been struggling to make progress.
The Democrats’ Environmental Agenda
Since taking control of the House in 2018, Democrats have been pushing for a wide range of environmental legislation. Some of the key bills they’ve introduced include:


The Clean Energy Jobs and Innovation Act: This bill would invest in clean energy research and development, incentivize the use of renewable energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.


The Climate Action Now Act: This bill would require the Trump administration to remain a party to the Paris climate agreement and develop a plan to meet the agreement’s emissions reduction targets.


The Moving Forward Act: This bill would invest $1.5 trillion in infrastructure improvements, including funding for clean energy projects, public transit, and electric vehicle charging stations.


The Protecting America’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act: This bill would designate more than 1.5 million acres of public lands as wilderness, permanently protecting them from development.


These are just a few examples of the many environmental bills that House Democrats have introduced. However, despite their ambitious agenda, they’ve struggled to make much headway.
The Challenges Facing House Democrats
There are several reasons why House Democrats have found it difficult to pass their environmental legislation:


A Republican-controlled Senate: Until the Democrats won the two Georgia runoff elections in January 2021, the Senate was controlled by Republicans. This meant that even if the House passed environmental bills, they were unlikely to become law.


A narrow majority in the House: While Democrats control the House, their majority is relatively small. This means that even a few defections can sink a bill.


A lack of bipartisanship: With Republicans largely opposed to Democratic environmental initiatives, it’s been difficult to find common ground.


A crowded legislative calendar: With so many other priorities on the Democrats’ agenda, it’s been challenging to find time to focus on environmental legislation.


What the Future Holds
Despite these challenges, House Democrats are still pushing for environmental progress. With the Senate now controlled by Democrats and President Biden in the White House, there’s renewed hope that some of their bills may become law.
One area where progress may be possible is infrastructure. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that the country’s infrastructure is in dire need of investment, and many Democrats believe that a green infrastructure package could be a way to address both environmental and economic concerns.
Another area where Democrats may be able to make progress is through executive action. President Biden has already taken a number of steps to address climate change, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline. With his administration’s focus on environmental issues, there may be more opportunities for action through executive orders and regulations.
Despite the challenges facing House Democrats, it’s clear that they remain committed to making progress on environmental issues. Whether through legislation, executive action, or a combination of both, they’ll continue to push for a cleaner, greener future.
