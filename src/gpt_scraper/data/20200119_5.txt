Title: The Big Ask of Black Voters: Trust the Government
The United States has experienced a tumultuous past when it comes to governance and voting rights. The long fight for equal rights and justice for black people has seen moments of progress and setbacks. In recent years, the issue of government trust has been a hot topic, especially with the increasing awareness of police brutality and systemic racism.
But as the US presidential election is approaching, another aspect of government trust comes to the forefront - voting. In 2020, voting might be the most crucial civic duty that can make a considerable impact in shaping the future of the country. And the big ask for black voters is to trust the government and engage in voting.
Trust, in general, is hard-earned and easily broken. When it comes to governments and their actions towards black people, the record is not spotless. From voter suppression to mass incarceration, black people in America have reasons to be skeptical about the government’s intentions.
However, the current situation requires a different approach. The 2020 election isn’t just about the presidential candidate - it is about safeguarding democracy, civil rights, and the protection of human dignity. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic fallout have exposed the weakness of America’s healthcare and economic systems. The government’s response to these crises will have lasting impacts on the future of the country.
One of the ways to make an effective impact is through voting. Black voters have a significant role to play, especially in swing states. The Black Vote has been a vital part of past elections, and 2020 isn’t any different. Several voter suppression tactics, such as strict voter ID requirements, purging of voter lists, reducing early voting hours, and constrained polling locations, continue to disenfranchise Black voters. But these issues can’t be addressed by staying away from voting.
The big ask for black voters to trust the government is not an easy one. However, the stakes are too high to take this civic duty lightly. Building trust is a continuous process, and it needs to be a two-way street. The government must act, not just through words but also with actual policies that address past grievances and move towards true equality.
Moreover, it is not just about the presidential elections. Black voters need to engage in the political process beyond once-in-four-year voting. Getting involved in local and state elections, making informed choices, and holding elected officials accountable is crucial for bringing about lasting change.
In conclusion, the big ask for black voters to trust the government is not an easy one. But considering the 2020 election’s significance, it is a necessary one. Voting is a powerful tool to shape the future of the United States. Continuing to fight for the right to vote and using it effectively can bring about change, and slowly but surely, rebuild trust in America’s governance.
