After Iran’s Missile Attack: Assessing the Fallout and What’s Next
On the night of January 8, 2020, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting two Iraqi military bases housing US troops in retaliation for the killing of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, by a US drone strike a few days earlier. The attack marked a dramatic escalation in the long-standing tensions between Iran and the United States and raised fears of a wider conflict in the volatile region.
The immediate aftermath of the attack was tense and uncertain. Initially, reports suggested that there were no casualties among US troops, but later it was revealed that at least 50 American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries. Iranian officials claimed that the attack was a proportionate response to the US aggression and warned that any further escalation would lead to more retaliation.
In response to the attack, US President Donald Trump delivered a televised address in which he announced that no Americans were harmed and that he would impose additional economic sanctions on Iran. He also reiterated his commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and called on NATO to become more involved in the Middle East.
The attack and its aftermath triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity as various countries tried to defuse the crisis. In a joint statement, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom expressed their “grave concern” and called on Iran to refrain from further escalation. The United Nations also urged all parties to exercise restraint and resume dialogue to resolve their differences.
In the weeks following the attack, tensions between Iran and the United States remained high, with both sides engaging in tit-for-tat actions. Iran announced that it would no longer abide by the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal and began enriching uranium at higher levels, prompting the European signatories to the deal to trigger a dispute mechanism. The US, in turn, announced more economic sanctions against Iran and deployed additional troops to the region.
Despite the heightened tensions, there were also some signs of diplomatic progress. In February 2020, the US and the Taliban signed a peace deal in Afghanistan, which was seen as a positive step towards reducing the US military presence in the region. In March 2020, the US also sent a letter to the Iranian government offering to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, which had hit Iran particularly hard.
As of today, the situation between Iran and the United States remains tense but relatively stable. President Joe Biden has signaled his intention to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal, but negotiations have stalled as Iran demands the lifting of all US sanctions before returning to compliance. In the meantime, both sides have taken steps to de-escalate tensions, including exchanging prisoners and engaging in indirect talks through European intermediaries.
The missile attack on US military bases in Iraq in January 2020 was a stark reminder of the volatility and unpredictability of the Middle East. While the immediate aftermath was tense and uncertain, both sides have taken steps to prevent further escalation and resume dialogue. However, the underlying issues that led to the attack – including the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the killing of Soleimani – remain unresolved and could flare up again at any time. The key to preventing another crisis is sustained diplomatic engagement and a willingness to compromise on both sides.
