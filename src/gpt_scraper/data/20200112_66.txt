Gracie Terzian is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist based in New York City. She’s known for her ethereal voice, poetic lyrics, and mastery of the ukulele.

Jeffrey Emanuel, on the other hand, is a seasoned jazz pianist and composer. He’s performed with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Wynton Marsalis and Christian McBride. His music is characterized by complex harmonies, intricate melodies, and a deep understanding of the history of jazz.
Despite their different backgrounds, Gracie and Jeffrey found common ground in their love of music. They first met at a music festival in upstate New York, where they were both performing. After hearing each other play, they knew that they had to collaborate.
Their first project together was a cover of the classic jazz standard “My Funny Valentine.” The song was a hit, and they soon began working on an album together. The result was “Saints and Poets,” a collection of original songs that showcased their unique blend of folk and jazz.
“Saints and Poets” was a critical and commercial success, and it established Gracie and Jeffrey as one of the most exciting new acts in contemporary music. The album was praised for its lush instrumentation, haunting melodies, and thought-provoking lyrics.
Since the release of “Saints and Poets,” Gracie and Jeffrey have continued to collaborate on new projects. They’ve performed at some of the most prestigious music festivals in the world, including the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreal Jazz Festival.
Their latest album, “Colors,” is perhaps their most ambitious project yet. The album features a range of guest artists, including trumpeter Keyon Harrold and guitarist Gilad Hekselman. The songs on “Colors” are inspired by the different emotions and moods that are associated with different colors.
Gracie and Jeffrey are a testament to the power of music to bring people together. They’ve created a unique sound that transcends genre and geography, and that speaks to audiences around the world. Their music is a celebration of life, love, and the beauty of the world around us.
