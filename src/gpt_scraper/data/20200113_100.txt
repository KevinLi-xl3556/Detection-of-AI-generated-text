Senator Bernie Sanders has recently stated that he would consider releasing a list of potential Supreme Court picks if he became President of the United States. This announcement has sparked interest among both his supporters and those who are undecided about the upcoming election.
In an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on September 7th, Senator Sanders responded to a question about his potential Supreme Court picks by saying, “We will develop a list of people who have a background in constitutional law who are progressive, who will be prepared to defend Roe v. Wade, voting rights, workers’ rights, the needs of consumers.” Sanders stated that he has not yet put together a list but that he would consider doing so if it would help motivate voters to support him in the upcoming election.
This idea of a potential list of Supreme Court picks has been used before in presidential campaigns. In 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump released a list of 21 potential picks for the Supreme Court, which helped to reassure conservative voters who were unsure about his stance on certain issues. If Senator Sanders were to release a list, it could have a similar effect on liberal voters who are looking for a candidate who will prioritize progressive values in their Supreme Court nominations.
Releasing a list of potential Supreme Court picks has its pros and cons. On the one hand, it can reassure voters and signal a candidate’s commitment to certain values. On the other hand, it could be seen as limiting the potential pool of nominees and potentially alienating certain groups of voters.
Regardless of whether or not Sanders releases a list, his comments have highlighted the importance of the Supreme Court in this year’s election. With the recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court has become an even more pressing issue for voters who are concerned about issues such as reproductive rights, healthcare, and civil liberties. Whoever becomes President will have the power to shape the court for years to come, and voters are paying close attention to the candidates’ positions on this issue.
Overall, Senator Sanders’ comment about a potential list of Supreme Court picks has sparked an important conversation about the role of the court in our political system. Whether or not he decides to release a list, voters will be looking closely at each candidate’s stance on the Supreme Court and how they plan to approach nominations if they are elected. The importance of this issue cannot be ignored, and it will undoubtedly play a significant role in the outcome of the election.
