The United States House of Representatives has officially delivered the articles of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate, setting the stage for his second impeachment trial. This historic move marks the first time a U.S. president has been impeached twice and will test the resilience of the country’s democratic institutions.
The article of impeachment, passed by the House on January 13, accuses Trump of “incitement of insurrection” for his role in the deadly Capitol Hill riot on January 6. The rioters, who stormed the Capitol building while Congress was certifying the electoral college votes, resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol police officer.
In a ceremonial procession through the Capitol, nine impeachment managers, led by Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, hand-delivered the article of impeachment to the Senate. The managers were accompanied by a single ceremonial clerk, a tradition that dates back to the early 20th century.
The trial, which is set to begin on February 9, will determine whether or not Trump is guilty of inciting the insurrection. The Senate will be required to vote on whether or not to convict the former president, with a two-thirds majority needed for a conviction.
This is not the first time Trump has faced impeachment. In 2019, he was impeached by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine. However, the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him on both counts.
The second impeachment trial of Trump comes at a time of great political polarization in the United States. The country is still reeling from the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump has repeatedly claimed was stolen from him through widespread voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence.
The trial will also test the limits of the Senate’s ability to hold a trial for a former president. There is a debate among constitutional scholars as to whether or not the Senate has jurisdiction to try a former president. Some argue that because Trump is no longer in office, the trial would be unconstitutional, while others believe that the Senate can still hold a trial in such circumstances.
Regardless of the outcome, the impeachment trial will have far-reaching consequences for the future of American politics. It will serve as a test of the country’s democratic institutions, and may determine whether or not political leaders can be held accountable for their actions.
