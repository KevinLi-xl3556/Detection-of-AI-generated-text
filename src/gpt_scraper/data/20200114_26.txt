Former Franklin College President Charged With Sex Crimes Involving a Child
The former president of Franklin College, a private liberal arts college located in Indiana, has been charged with multiple sex crimes involving a child. Thomas J. Minar, who served as the president of the college from 2015 to 2019, was arrested on April 7, 2021, and charged with six counts of child exploitation and possession of child pornography.
According to court documents, the investigation into Minar began in January 2020, when an undercover agent with the Indiana Crimes Against Children Task Force discovered that Minar was communicating with an individual he believed to be a 15-year-old boy. The conversations allegedly became sexual in nature, and Minar sent explicit photos and videos of himself to the undercover agent.
Investigators executed a search warrant at Minar’s home in June 2020, where they found multiple devices containing child pornography. They also discovered that Minar had engaged in similar communications with other individuals, both in Indiana and out of state.
Minar resigned from his position as president of Franklin College in June 2019, citing personal reasons. In a statement released after his arrest, the college expressed shock and dismay at the charges against their former president.
“The allegations against Dr. Minar are deeply disturbing and completely contrary to the values of Franklin College,” the statement read. “We are cooperating fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so throughout this process.”
Minar appeared in court on April 8, where he was ordered held without bond. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison for each count of child exploitation and up to 20 years in prison for each count of possession of child pornography.
The charges against Minar are the latest in a string of high-profile cases involving sexual misconduct by individuals in positions of power. In recent years, the #MeToo movement has shed light on the prevalence of sexual harassment and abuse in industries ranging from entertainment to politics to academia.
The case of Thomas J. Minar serves as a stark reminder that even those in positions of great responsibility and authority can be capable of unspeakable acts. It is a tragedy for the victims involved, and a wake-up call for institutions to be vigilant in preventing and responding to sexual misconduct.
