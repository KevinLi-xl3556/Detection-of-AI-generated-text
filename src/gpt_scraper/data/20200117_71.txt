This Is the Guy Who’s Taking Away the Likes
Social media has become an enormous part of our daily lives, with billions of people sharing their thoughts, experiences, and images online. However, this constant exposure can also have negative effects on mental health, self-esteem, and authenticity. That is why some platforms are experimenting with removing the most popular metric of feedback: likes.
Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, has been testing this feature in various countries since 2019, and Twitter has also explored hiding likes and retweets. The rationale behind this change is to reduce the pressure to compare and compete, and to encourage more meaningful interactions and content creation.
But who is behind this bold move? Meet Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram since 2018, who has made it his mission to make the platform safer and more enjoyable for users. Mosseri, a 38-year-old New Yorker with a background in design and product management, previously worked at Facebook for ten years, where he helped create the news feed and led the mobile app division.
In an interview with CBS News, Mosseri explained that the idea of hiding likes came from research and feedback indicating that many users felt anxious and self-conscious about the number of likes they received, and that this metric often overshadowed the quality and creativity of the posts. While likes may be useful for gauging popularity or interest, they can also be manipulated or bought, and they don’t necessarily reflect the impact or value of the content.
Mosseri recognizes that removing likes entirely could have unintended consequences or backlash from influencers and businesses who rely on this metric as a measure of their success and engagement, but he believes that the benefits of a like-free Instagram outweigh the costs. For instance, it could encourage users to post more authentic and diverse content, since they wouldn’t have to compete for likes or follow trends as much. It could also reduce the strain on mental health and body image issues, particularly among young people who are more vulnerable to peer pressure and unrealistic standards.
Of course, the debate about whether hiding likes is a good or bad move is ongoing, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Some critics argue that likes are an essential tool for creators and marketers to signal their popularity and credibility, and that removing them could obscure their influence or impact. Others argue that hiding likes is just a symbolic gesture that doesn’t address the deeper problems of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and addictive design that plague social media.
Regardless of the outcome of Instagram’s experiment, it’s clear that the issue of likes is more than just a trivial feature, and that it reflects a broader cultural shift in how we perceive ourselves and others online. Whether likes stay or go, it’s up to us to decide how we define success, happiness, and connection in the digital age. And Adam Mosseri and his team are certainly making us think twice about it.
