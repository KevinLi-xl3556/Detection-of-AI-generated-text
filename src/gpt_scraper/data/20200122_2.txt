I Misjudged the Gender Effect: Reflecting on My Bias and Seeking to Overcome It
As a society, we often speak about the importance of diversity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity brings different perspectives and insights, and that inclusive cultures are vital for everyone to feel valued and heard. Still, despite our good intentions, we all have biases, some of which we may be unaware of. I recently realized that I had misjudged the gender effect and felt compelled to reflect on my biases and, more importantly, to seek to overcome them.
My realization came when I was presenting some data to a group of colleagues. I noticed that I was referring to the people in the data using gendered terms, such as “he” and “she,” despite the fact that the data did not reveal the gender of the individuals. An astute colleague pointed out that my language suggested that I may have assumed a gender bias in the data, even though it was not there.
I was initially defensive, thinking that I was using gender terms simply for clarity, as is often done when presenting or writing. Still, her comment gave me pause, and I began to examine my own experiences and assumptions about gender more closely. I realized that I often unconsciously used gendered language when speaking generally or referring to people whose gender was unknown or irrelevant. I also noted that in some other areas of my life, I had noticed how my biases were playing out.
For example, I saw that I implicitly tended to associate certain qualities with men and others with women. I often judged men for their personalities or behavior, whereas I was more generous to women. Yet, conversely, I would also sometimes consider women’s performance or competence more harshly because of their gender, even though I knew that this was unfair and inconsistent.
Reflecting on my discoveries, I began to see how my bias was acting in my life and work, and I knew that it was something that I needed to challenge. To start, I began to consciously monitor my language, being more mindful of how I used gendered terms and when they were appropriate. I also sought feedback from colleagues and friends, asking them to keep me in check when I used biased language.
Moreover, I committed to learning more about gender issues and diversity, reading up on feminist theory and research on implicit bias. I attended workshops on unconscious bias and gender equity and spoke with colleagues and friends about their experiences.
It has been a challenging journey so far, but also an incredibly rewarding one. I have seen how my thinking and behavior have changed as a result of my efforts, and I am more aware of the impact that gender bias can have on not only individuals but our society as a whole. Furthermore, I have been able to take action to become a better ally for gender equity, in my own life and my work.
In conclusion, my experience has taught me that even those with the best of intentions can harbor unconscious biases. However, by acknowledging our biases and committing to challenging them, we can start to create a more inclusive society. The gender effect, like all biases, can be overcome with self-reflection, education, and action. So let’s commit to this work, and start today.
