Former President Donald Trump’s policies towards Iran have been a topic of much controversy, with some praising his hard-line stance and others criticizing his approach. Late-night host Stephen Colbert, however, had some strong words for Trump’s Iran policies in a recent monologue, calling it the “worst Throwback Thursday ever.”
In the monologue, Colbert criticized Trump for his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated during the Obama administration. The deal had lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the deal was widely condemned by the international community, including many of America’s closest allies.
“Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran deal was a catastrophic mistake,” Colbert said. “It was like going to a restaurant, ordering a perfectly good meal, and then setting the restaurant on fire before you even took a bite.”
Colbert also criticized Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, which involved imposing a wide range of economic sanctions on the country. While Trump claimed that the sanctions were intended to bring Iran back to the negotiating table, many experts argued that they were only hurting ordinary Iranians and doing little to change the regime’s behavior.
“Trump’s ‘maximum pressure’ policy was a disaster,” Colbert said. “It was like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. All it did was make things worse.”
Despite his criticisms of Trump’s Iran policies, Colbert acknowledged that the situation in Iran was complex and that there were no easy solutions.
“Iran is a complicated issue, and there are no easy answers,” Colbert said. “But we need leaders who are willing to engage with Iran diplomatically, rather than just resorting to sanctions and threats.”
Colbert’s monologue is just the latest example of how Trump’s policies continue to be a divisive issue, even after he has left office. As the Biden administration seeks to re-engage with Iran and potentially rejoin the nuclear deal, it remains to be seen whether Trump’s legacy on Iran will be one of success or failure. But for Colbert, at least, it’s clear which side he falls on.
