Yusaku Maezawa is a Japanese billionaire and entrepreneur who made his fortune in the fashion industry. He is known for his extravagant lifestyle and his love of art, particularly contemporary art. But in recent years, he has become even more well-known for his ambitious plans to travel to space, and for his search for a “special woman” to accompany him on this journey.
Maezawa was born in 1975 in Japan, and grew up in a family that owned a successful clothing business. He dropped out of college to pursue his own entrepreneurial dreams, starting a music company called Start Today in 1998. The company went on to launch one of Japan’s first online fashion retailers, Zozotown, which grew rapidly and eventually became Japan’s largest online fashion retailer.
Thanks to the success of Zozotown, Maezawa became a billionaire at a relatively young age, and he has used his wealth to pursue his passions for art and adventure. He has collected works by artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jeff Koons, and Pablo Picasso, and he has also taken part in a number of extreme sports, including car racing and mountain climbing.
But it is Maezawa’s interest in space that has garnered the most attention in recent years. In 2018, he announced that he had purchased a ticket on SpaceX’s first commercial space flight, which is planned for 2023. Maezawa has said that he plans to bring a group of artists with him on the flight, and that he hopes the experience will inspire them to create new works of art.
More recently, Maezawa has also made headlines for his search for a “special woman” to join him on the space flight. He announced the search in January 2020, and received more than 27,000 applications from women around the world. He eventually narrowed the field down to eight finalists, and in March 2021 he announced that he had chosen a 29-year-old Japanese woman named Yuzuka Maezawa (no relation) to accompany him on the flight.
Maezawa’s search for a partner has attracted both admiration and criticism. Some have praised him for using his wealth and platform to promote science and exploration, and for encouraging more women to pursue careers in science and technology. Others have criticized him for treating the search like a reality TV show, and for objectifying women in the process.
Despite the controversy, Maezawa remains committed to his vision of using art and technology to inspire and connect people around the world. He has said that he hopes the space flight will be a “symbolic act” that brings people together and promotes peace and understanding. And while his plans may be unconventional, there is no doubt that he is a visionary thinker who is pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
