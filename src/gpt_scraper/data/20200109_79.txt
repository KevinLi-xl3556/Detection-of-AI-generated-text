In a historic move, Brazil’s top court has struck down a ban on a Netflix film portraying Jesus as gay. The decision comes after months of legal battles and heated debates, and marks a significant victory for freedom of expression and LGBTQ+ rights in the country.
The controversial film, titled “The First Temptation of Christ”, was produced by Brazilian comedy group Porta dos Fundos and was released on Netflix in December 2019. The film depicts a gay Jesus bringing his boyfriend home to meet his family, and has been met with widespread backlash from conservative and religious groups.
In January 2020, a judge in Rio de Janeiro banned the film, ruling that it “seriously offended” the “Christian faith.” The ban sparked outrage from free speech advocates, who argued that it was a violation of the country’s constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression.
The legal battle escalated, with Porta dos Fundos filing a lawsuit challenging the ban. In April, a lower court ruled in favor of the group, stating that the ban violated their right to free speech.
But the controversy did not end there. In December 2020, the same judge who had initially banned the film overturned the lower court’s decision, reinstating the ban and ordering Netflix to remove the film from its platform.
However, the decision was short-lived. On Thursday, Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled that the ban violated the country’s constitution and overturned it. The court stated that freedom of expression must be protected, even if some people feel offended by certain content.
The ruling was praised by free speech advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who argued that the ban was discriminatory and represented an attack on minority rights. They celebrated the decision as a victory against censorship and intolerance.
“This is a historic victory for freedom of expression and LGBTQ+ rights,” said João Pedroso de Campos, a lawyer representing Porta dos Fundos. “The court has sent a clear message that artistic expression cannot be censored and that minoritarian voices must be heard.”
However, conservative and religious groups expressed disappointment with the ruling, arguing that it undermined their religious beliefs and values. Some called for protests and boycotts against Netflix and the film.
The controversy surrounding the film reflects broader tensions in Brazilian society over issues of identity, morality and religion. Brazil is a predominantly Catholic country, but has seen a rise in conservative and evangelical movements in recent years, leading to clashes with progressive and liberal groups.
The Supreme Court’s ruling on the film is likely to have far-reaching implications for freedom of expression and LGBTQ+ rights in Brazil, as well as for the relationship between religion and state. It remains to be seen how the decision will be received by different sectors of society and what its long-term impact will be. But for now, it represents a significant victory for those who believe in the power of art to challenge norms and provoke thought.
