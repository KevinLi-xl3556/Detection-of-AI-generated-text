New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s plan to build a train to La Guardia airport has drawn criticism from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The proposed plan, which aims to connect the airport to the New York City subway system, has been met with mixed reactions from the public, but Ocasio-Cortez has been particularly vocal in her opposition. In this article, we’ll explore why Ocasio-Cortez is criticizing Cuomo’s plan for a train to La Guardia.
Firstly, it’s important to understand the context of Ocasio-Cortez’s criticism. The Congresswoman represents New York’s 14th congressional district, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens. La Guardia airport is located in Queens, and many of Ocasio-Cortez’s constituents rely on public transportation to get to the airport. The proposed train to La Guardia would connect to the 7 train, which runs through Queens and Manhattan, making it an important issue for Ocasio-Cortez and her constituents.
Ocasio-Cortez’s main criticism of the plan is that it doesn’t go far enough. In a tweet, she stated that “our communities need so much more than a train station - we need a plan to actually invest in them.” She argues that the proposed train to La Guardia doesn’t do enough to address the broader transportation issues facing Queens and the Bronx. Many of her constituents rely on buses and trains that are overcrowded and unreliable, and Ocasio-Cortez believes that the governor’s plan doesn’t do enough to address those issues.
Another issue that Ocasio-Cortez has raised is the potential cost of the project. Cuomo has estimated that the train to La Guardia will cost $1.5 billion, but Ocasio-Cortez argues that the money could be better spent on other transportation initiatives. She has suggested that the money could be used to improve bus service in the area or to expand subway lines in Queens and the Bronx.
Finally, Ocasio-Cortez has also raised concerns about the environmental impact of the project. Building a train to La Guardia would require significant construction, which could lead to increased air pollution and noise in the surrounding communities. Ocasio-Cortez has argued that the governor’s plan doesn’t do enough to address these environmental concerns.
In conclusion, Ocasio-Cortez’s criticism of Cuomo’s plan for a train to La Guardia is rooted in her desire to see more comprehensive transportation solutions for her constituents. While the train would certainly make it easier for travelers to get to and from the airport, Ocasio-Cortez argues that it doesn’t do enough to address the broader transportation issues facing Queens and the Bronx. Ultimately, the success of the plan will depend on whether it can address these concerns and meet the needs of the communities it serves.
