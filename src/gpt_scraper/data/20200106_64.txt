On January 3rd, 2020, Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was killed in a targeted drone strike authorized by President Donald Trump. The news of his death sent shockwaves across the world and sparked a wave of reactions from people of Iranian descent, particularly those living in the United States. In California, home to a large Iranian-American community, the news was met with a mix of emotions, ranging from grief and anger to fear and uncertainty.
For many Iranian-Americans in California, Soleimani was seen as a national hero who had played a critical role in defending Iran against its enemies, particularly during the Iran-Iraq War. To them, his death was a great loss and a violation of Iranian sovereignty. “Soleimani was a symbol of Iranian resistance against foreign aggression,” said Fariba, a 47-year-old Iranian-American living in Los Angeles. “His death is a big blow to our national pride.”
Others, however, saw Soleimani as a ruthless and dangerous figure who had committed numerous atrocities, both within Iran and abroad. They argued that his death was a necessary measure to protect American interests and prevent further escalation in the region. “Soleimani was a terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of countless innocent people,” said Reza, a 32-year-old Iranian-American living in San Francisco. “I’m glad he’s gone.”
Regardless of their personal opinions about Soleimani, many Iranian-Americans in California expressed concern about the potential fallout from his death. Some feared that it could lead to a full-scale war between the United States and Iran, which would have disastrous consequences for both countries and the entire region. Others worried about the possibility of retaliation against Iranian-Americans living in the United States, who could be targeted by extremists or subjected to increased scrutiny by law enforcement.
“I’m afraid that this will make things worse for us as Iranian-Americans,” said Parisa, a 29-year-old Iranian-American living in San Diego. “We’ve already faced discrimination and harassment in the past, and this could make it even harder for us to live our lives without fear.”
In the days following Soleimani’s death, Iranian-Americans in California joined protests and vigils in cities across the state, expressing their grief and anger over the loss of a national hero. They also voiced their concerns about the potential consequences of the strike and called on both the United States and Iran to exercise restraint and seek peaceful solutions to their differences.
Despite the tensions and uncertainties surrounding Soleimani’s death, many Iranian-Americans in California remained optimistic about the future. They believed that the strength and resilience of their community would help them weather any challenges that might arise. “We’ve been through a lot as a community,” said Ali, a 40-year-old Iranian-American living in Sacramento. “But we’ve always found ways to support each other and stay strong. I have faith that we’ll get through this, too.”
In conclusion, the death of General Soleimani was a deeply divisive issue for Iranian-Americans in California, reflecting the complexity of their relationship with Iran and their identities as both Americans and Iranians. While some mourned his loss as a national hero, others saw it as a necessary measure to protect American interests. Regardless of their opinions, however, they shared a common concern for the safety and well-being of their community in the face of the ongoing tensions between the United States and Iran.
