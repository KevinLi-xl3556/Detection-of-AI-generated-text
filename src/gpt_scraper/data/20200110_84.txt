The relationship between the United States and Iraq has been fraught with tension since the U.S. invasion in 2003. The latest escalation involves the U.S. military’s presence in Iraq, and Iraq’s request to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. troops. However, the U.S. government has made it clear that it will not be entertaining such discussions.
The request for the withdrawal of U.S. troops stems from tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which has been increasing over the past year. In recent weeks, the situation has escalated, with the U.S. killing Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, an Iraqi military commander who was seen as a close ally of Iran.
Following the strike, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. However, the U.S. government rejected the request, stating that its troops are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and that they are in the country to help fight ISIS.
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said that “any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership—not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East.”
The statement also said that the U.S. is committed to supporting Iraqi sovereignty and that the U.S. would not engage in unilateral military action in the country.
However, the Iraqi government has made it clear that it wants U.S. troops to leave. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi said in a statement that the U.S. had rejected the request for the withdrawal of troops, despite the fact that it was made in response to the killing of Iranian General Soleimani in Iraq.
Abdul-Mahdi also stated that the Iraqi government would take other measures to ensure the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.
The standoff between Iraq and the U.S. over the withdrawal of troops highlights the ongoing tension between the two countries. It also highlights the increasing tension between the U.S. and Iran in the Middle East.
While the U.S. government maintains that its troops are in Iraq to fight ISIS, it is clear that there are wider geopolitical considerations at play. The U.S. sees Iran as a threat to its interests in the region and has been taking a hard line against the country.
Given the current situation, it is unclear how the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq will be resolved. The U.S. government’s refusal to discuss the withdrawal of troops is unlikely to sit well with the Iraqi government, and it remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the coming days and weeks.
