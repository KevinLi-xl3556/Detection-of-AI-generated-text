Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been among the most vocal opponents of allowing former National Security Adviser John Bolton to testify in President Trump’s impeachment trial. The question is, why is McConnell so afraid of Bolton’s testimony?
The answer lies in the potential impact of Bolton’s testimony on both McConnell’s personal political standing and on the Republican party as a whole.
Firstly, McConnell’s opposition to Bolton testifying reflects his desire to protect the President Trump, a key ally in his political agenda. Bolton’s testimony, which is rumored to contain damning evidence against the President, could potentially damage McConnell’s early endorsement of Trump’s agenda and could erode his support among conservative voters. McConnell’s political future could hinge on his perceived loyalty to Trump, so he has to vet any testimony that could contradict or undermine this loyalty.
Furthermore, there is the fact that Bolton’s potential testimony could have long-lasting impacts on the Republican party as a whole. A key feature of McConnell’s leadership of the Senate has been his ability to maintain party unity and to protect Republican legislators from politically damaging scenarios.
Allowing Bolton to testify could fracture the party, as those members who are concerned about the allegations against Trump could break ranks with the leadership, possibly altering the perception of the party’s current support for legal and transparent governance. With the 2020 elections just around the corner, McConnell knows that this could have devastating impacts on the party’s electoral prospects, putting many of those Republican officeholders in danger of losing seats.
Finally, there is the issue of Bolton’s credibility. Despite his prominent position in the Trump administration, Bolton has been seen as a maverick outsider relative to other prominent GOP figures. Republicans have long contended that the allegations against Trump are simply the result of a partisan witch hunt, led by Democratic investigators who are trying to undermine the President’s mandate to govern. By allowing Bolton to testify, McConnell would be giving credence to these claims and giving the opposition a tough breeding ground to criticize his intentions.
In summary, Mitch McConnell’s opposition is rooted in his political aspirations and his long-held leadership style. Allowing Bolton to testify could create a political earthquake that he isn’t ready to withstand, which is not to mention the potential fallouts from revealing two Republican strategies come to foil the Democrats’ impeachment efforts.
