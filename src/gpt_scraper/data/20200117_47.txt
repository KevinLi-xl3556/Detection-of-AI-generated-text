Former independent counsel Ken Starr, who gained notoriety for his role in the impeachment investigation of former President Bill Clinton, will once again enter the impeachment fray, this time as part of President Donald Trump’s defense team.
The announcement came late last week, as Trump’s legal team prepared to make their case before the Senate in the ongoing impeachment trial. Starr, along with prominent defense attorneys Alan Dershowitz and Robert Ray, will join the team in an effort to defend the president against charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Starr, who served as independent counsel from 1994 to 1999, is perhaps best known for his investigation into Clinton’s extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The investigation ultimately led to Clinton’s impeachment by the House of Representatives on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. While Clinton was acquitted by the Senate, the experience left a lasting impression on American politics and Starr’s reputation.
Now, nearly two decades later, Starr finds himself in the rare position of defending a president against impeachment. In a statement released last week, Starr expressed his commitment to “upholding the Constitution and protecting the presidency,” and praised the president’s legal team for their “dedication to justice and the rule of law.”
Starr’s inclusion on the team has generated some controversy. Critics point to his checkered past, including his handling of the Lewinsky investigation, as evidence that he is not fit to defend the president in this highly charged political climate. Others argue that Starr’s reputation as a “determined investigator” and skilled legal strategist make him an asset to the defense.
For his part, Starr seems undeterred by the criticism. He has pledged to approach the case with “integrity and fairness,” and to do his part to ensure that the Senate trial is conducted in a way that meets the high standards of American justice.
The upcoming weeks promise to be a defining moment for American politics, as the Senate weighs whether to remove President Trump from office. With such high stakes, the president’s legal team has chosen to bring in a roster of seasoned legal experts to help make their case. Whether that will be enough to influence the outcome of the impeachment trial remains to be seen, but one thing is certain – the eyes of the world will be watching as Ken Starr returns to the fray.
