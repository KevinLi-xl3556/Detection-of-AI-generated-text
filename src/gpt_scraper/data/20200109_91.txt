In recent months, the astronomical community has been abuzz with speculation about the fate of one of the most recognizable stars in the night sky: Betelgeuse. This red supergiant, located in the constellation of Orion, has been exhibiting some unusual behavior that has astronomers wondering if it might be on the verge of going supernova.
The first signs of trouble appeared in late 2019, when Betelgeuse began to visibly dim. For a star that is usually one of the brightest in the night sky, this was a significant and unexpected change. The dimming continued into early 2020, and by February of that year, Betelgeuse had lost over two-thirds of its brightness.
The sudden dimming sparked speculation that Betelgeuse might be about to go supernova, which would make it the brightest supernova in the night sky in over 400 years. However, as the months went on, Betelgeuse began to brighten again, and by late 2020 it had returned to its normal brightness levels.
So, what was behind this unusual behavior? Was Betelgeuse really about to blow, or was it just experiencing a fainting spell?
One theory is that Betelgeuse experienced a mass ejection event, which caused some of its outer layers to be expelled into space. This could have caused the star to temporarily dim, as less light was being emitted from its surface. Another possibility is that the star was experiencing a period of increased dust production, which would also have led to a decrease in visible light.
However, neither of these explanations fully accounts for the magnitude of Betelgeuse’s dimming. Some astronomers have suggested that the star may have experienced a “partial collapse,” which would have caused its outer layers to collapse inward briefly before bouncing back out. This would have caused a decrease in visible light as well as a change in the star’s shape and size.
While Betelgeuse’s behavior has been fascinating to watch, it’s worth noting that the star is still a long way from going supernova. Betelgeuse is estimated to be between 8 and 8.5 million years old, and red supergiants like it typically have lifetimes of only a few million years. While it’s impossible to predict exactly when Betelgeuse will go supernova, it’s likely to happen within the next 100,000 years or so.
When Betelgeuse does finally go supernova, it will be an incredible sight. The explosion will be visible from Earth even during the day, and the resulting supernova remnant will be visible in the night sky for centuries to come. However, there’s no need to worry about Betelgeuse exploding anytime soon. For now, it seems that the star is just experiencing a fainting spell, rather than signaling the end of its life.
