‘Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick,’ by Zora Neale Hurston: An Excerpt
Zora Neale Hurston was an American author, folklorist and anthropologist, known for her candid portrayal of African American life during the early 20th century. Her works such as ‘Their Eyes Were Watching God’ and ‘Barracoon’ are still considered literary classics to this day. However, her lesser-known work, ‘Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick,’ has recently resurfaced in the literary world.
‘Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick’ is a collection of stories that was first published in 1934. The tales are set in Harlem and focus on the lives of African Americans during the Great Depression. The title of the collection is a colloquialism that refers to overcoming adversity using unorthodox methods.
In the story ‘Spunk,’ Hurston tells the tale of a fearless and charismatic man who defies social norms and becomes the talk of the town. His charm draws women to him like moths to a flame, but they soon realize that his bravado is not without consequence. When he is challenged to prove his courage by walking through a ghostly swamp, Spunk meets his demise.
‘Sweat,’ another story in the collection, is a powerful portrayal of domestic abuse. Delia is a hardworking laundress who endures years of physical and emotional abuse from her husband Sykes. Despite her hardship, she remains determined to support herself and her household. When Sykes brings home a snake to torment her, Delia snaps and refuses to be a victim any longer.
These stories, which Hurston first heard during her travels through the American South, are told in the vernacular of African American speech during the era. Hurston’s vivid descriptions and dynamic characters make each story come alive and leave the reader pondering life and human nature.
‘Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick’ is a remarkable work that offers a unique glimpse into African American life during the early 20th century. Through her storytelling, Hurston masterfully portrays the struggles and triumphs of a community that was often overlooked and undervalued. If you haven’t read this collection, it is definitely worth checking out.
