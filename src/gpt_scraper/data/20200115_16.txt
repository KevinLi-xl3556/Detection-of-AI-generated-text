In the world of sports, competition is the name of the game. But for one Iranian chess official, the competition has taken a back seat to fear for her safety. Shohreh Bayat, a well-known Iranian chess referee, has made international headlines after a photo of her without a hijab, the Islamic head covering worn by many women in Iran, was circulated online.
The photo in question was taken during the Women’s World Chess Championship held in Shanghai, China, in January 2020. Bayat, who was serving as the chief referee for the event, was photographed with her hair uncovered while standing next to the players. In Iran, where women are required by law to wear the hijab in public, such a photo is seen as a violation of the country’s strict dress code.
After the photo went viral on social media, Bayat received threats and abuse online from people in Iran, with some even calling for her to be punished or executed. Bayat, who had returned to Iran after the tournament, quickly realized that her safety was in danger and decided to flee the country.
In an interview with The Guardian, Bayat said, “I had to leave my home, my family, and my job behind because of a photo that was taken in another country. It’s hard to describe how it feels to be in this situation.”
Bayat, who has been living in the United Kingdom since fleeing Iran, has applied for asylum and is awaiting a decision. Meanwhile, she continues to receive support from the international chess community, with many top players and officials speaking out in her defense.
However, the situation highlights the difficult position that many Iranian women face when it comes to their rights and freedoms. The country’s strict dress code, which requires women to cover their hair and wear loose clothing, has been a subject of controversy for years, with many Iranian women pushing back against the law and risking arrest or punishment.
For Bayat, the situation has been a nightmare, but she remains hopeful that she will be able to return to Iran one day. “I love my country, and I miss it,” she said. “But I can’t go back there until I know that I’ll be safe.”
The case of Shohreh Bayat has once again highlighted the importance of women’s rights and freedoms, not just in Iran but around the world. It is a reminder that even in 2023, many women still face discrimination and oppression, and that the fight for equality is far from over.
