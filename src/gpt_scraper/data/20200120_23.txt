Mac Miller and Jon Brion Had a Vision. It Almost Came True.
Mac Miller was a talented rapper, producer, and songwriter who had earned a devoted following with his introspective and honest lyrics. Jon Brion was a well-respected producer, musician, and composer who had worked with artists such as Fiona Apple, Kanye West, and Aimee Mann. In 2018, the two men began working on Miller’s fifth studio album, entitled “Swimming.” The result was a masterpiece of musical creativity and emotional depth, hailed by critics as one of the best albums of the year. Sadly, Miller died just one month after its release, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind a stunned and grieving fan base.
Despite Miller’s untimely death, “Swimming” has endured as a powerful testament to his artistry and vision. The album was a departure from Miller’s previous work, which had emphasized his skills as a rapper and lyricist. Instead, Miller and Brion focused on creating a more musical and experimental sound, incorporating elements of jazz, funk, and electronic music. The result was a lush and complex sonic landscape, filled with imaginative arrangements and unexpected sonic textures. Miller’s introspective and deeply personal lyrics were still present, but they were now framed by an ambitious and expansive musical world.
Brion’s influence on “Swimming” cannot be overstated. His eclectic musical background, which included stints as a session player for the likes of Michael Jackson and Madonna, brought a unique perspective to Miller’s songs. Brion encouraged Miller to experiment with different rhythms, meters, and chord progressions, pushing him out of his comfort zone and into new creative territories. The two men spent countless hours in the studio, tinkering with sounds and ideas, striving for a sonic vision that was both cohesive and ambitious.
Sadly, Miller did not live to see the critical and commercial success of “Swimming.” The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, earning widespread praise for its inventive arrangements and soul-searching lyrics. Miller’s fans and friends mourned his passing in September 2018, just as he was beginning a national tour in support of the album. But even in death, Miller’s artistic legacy continued to grow. “Swimming” was awarded a posthumous Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album, and a deluxe edition of the album, entitled “Circles,” was released in 2020. The album was also the subject of a recent documentary, entitled “Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life,” which traced Miller’s creative journey and his enduring impact on his fans and collaborators.
“Swimming” was a testament to the creative vision and technical skill of Mac Miller and Jon Brion. Together, they had imagined and created a sonic world that was powerful, original, and emotionally resonant. It was a world that reflected Miller’s struggles with fame, addiction, and identity, but also his deep love of music and his desire to create something meaningful and lasting. When Miller died, he left behind a legacy of music that will continue to inspire and move listeners for years to come.
