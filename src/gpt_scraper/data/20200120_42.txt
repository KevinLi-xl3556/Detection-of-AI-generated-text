Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a series of political reforms that could reshape the power structure of his country, potentially allowing him to stay in office beyond the current term limit.
In a speech to the Federal Assembly on Wednesday, Putin outlined plans to give more power to parliament and the prime minister, while limiting the influence of the presidency. The changes would require significant amendments to the Russian constitution, which Putin has reportedly already submitted to parliament.
Perhaps most significantly, Putin also proposed a new position of “State Councilor,” which would have sweeping powers over domestic and foreign policy. It’s unclear who would hold this position, but Putin suggested it could be himself after he steps down as president in 2024.
“Overall, these amendments will offer a significant reinforcement of the role of parliament … of the independence and responsibility of the prime minister, of the entire government,” Putin said in his speech.
He added that the changes would make the president “the guarantor of the country’s security and domestic stability, of the sovereignty,” but that the role would otherwise be largely ceremonial.
Critics of Putin have called the proposed reforms a power grab by the longtime leader, who has been in power for over two decades. They argue that the changes would allow him to stay at the top of Russian politics indefinitely, while weakening democratic institutions and eroding checks and balances.
“This is a blatant attempt by Putin to constitutionalize his autocracy and ensure he remains in power beyond the end of his term in 2024,” said Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure who is currently under house arrest.
Putin’s supporters argue that the proposed changes would strengthen the state and ensure stability in the face of economic and security challenges. They also note that the president’s power would still be limited under the new system.
The proposed reforms come amid growing unrest in Russia over economic and political issues. Putin has faced protests and criticism over corruption, censorship, and the country’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.
It’s unclear how quickly the proposed amendments will be approved by the Russian parliament, which is dominated by Putin’s United Russia party. If they are passed, however, Putin’s position as one of the world’s most powerful leaders is likely to be further cemented.
