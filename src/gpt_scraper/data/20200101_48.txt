In the summer of 2016, Pokémon Go became a cultural phenomenon around the world. The mobile game, which used augmented reality technology to allow players to catch virtual creatures in real-world locations, was a massive hit. However, not everyone was thrilled with the game’s popularity, as evidenced by an incident involving the Canadian military.
In August of 2016, a group of military personnel were on patrol near the Canadian Forces Base Borden in Ontario. As they patrolled, they noticed several people walking around the base and appearing to be taking pictures of the buildings. Concerned that they might be gathering intelligence, the soldiers approached the individuals and asked what they were doing. To their surprise, they were told that they were playing Pokémon Go.
The soldiers were initially confused, as they had never heard of the game before. They soon realized that the game was responsible for the influx of people near the base, who were drawn to a virtual “gym” that had been placed on the base’s grounds as part of the game. The soldiers were bemused by the situation and eventually let the players continue their game, but the incident highlighted the unexpected impact that Pokémon Go was having on the world.
Pokémon Go was a massive hit when it was released, quickly becoming the most downloaded app in the history of the Apple App Store. The game’s popularity was due in large part to its use of augmented reality technology, which allowed players to see virtual creatures in the real world through their mobile devices. The game was a cultural phenomenon, with players of all ages and backgrounds getting involved in the hunt for Pokémon.
However, the game’s popularity also caused some unexpected consequences. In addition to the incident with the Canadian military, there were reports of players trespassing on private property, causing traffic accidents while playing the game, and even walking off cliffs while attempting to catch virtual creatures. The game’s creators, Niantic, had to issue warnings to players to be aware of their surroundings while playing the game.
Despite the unexpected consequences, Pokémon Go continued to be a cultural touchstone for many people. The game’s popularity has waned somewhat in the years since its release, but it remains a beloved part of gaming history. The incident with the Canadian military is just one example of the impact that the game had on the world, and it serves as a reminder of the unexpected consequences that can arise from even the most innocuous-seeming phenomena.
