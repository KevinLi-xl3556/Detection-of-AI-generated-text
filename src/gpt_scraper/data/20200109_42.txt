On January 8th, 2020, the world was shaken when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced that they would be stepping back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family. In a statement, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle expressed their desire to become financially independent and split their time between North America and the UK.
While the announcement initially came as a shock to many, for Black Britons, it was not entirely surprising. Meghan Markle, who is of mixed-race heritage, has faced intense scrutiny and racism from the British press since she first began dating Prince Harry.
The constant vilification of Markle by certain sections of the British media has been well-documented. She has been called “difficult,” “pushy,” and “demanding” – all tropes that are often used to describe successful women of color. She has been accused of causing a rift between Prince William and Prince Harry, despite the fact that the brothers have had their own issues for years.
Additionally, Markle’s relationship with her father has been well-publicized. He has repeatedly made hurtful and damaging comments about her to the media, which have only added to the stress she must be feeling.
It is no secret that the British royal family has a complicated history with race. The monarchy has been criticized for perpetuating a colonial mindset, and for failing to adequately address its own racist past. While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriage was celebrated by many as a sign of progress, it seems that for others, it was seen as a threat to the values and traditions of the royal family.
For Black Britons, Markle’s decision to step back from royal duties is understandable. Many have experienced similar forms of racism and discrimination in their own lives, and can empathize with the constant scrutiny and pressure she must have been under. While there are certainly issues of privilege and wealth at play, it is important to recognize the ways in which race and racism have influenced the treatment of Markle by both the media and the public.
It is also worth noting that Markle’s decision to step back from royal duties could have significant implications for the monarchy itself. For many people, she was seen as a breath of fresh air – a modern, relatable figure who brought a new perspective to the royal family. If the monarchy is not able to address its issues with race and diversity, it may well lose the support and enthusiasm of a younger, more diverse generation.
In short, Black Britons “know why” Meghan Markle wants out because they understand the complex ways in which race and racism have influenced her treatment. While her decision may be controversial, it is ultimately a reflection of the need for change – both within the royal family and British society as a whole.
