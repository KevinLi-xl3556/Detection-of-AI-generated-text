Jimmy Heath, 93, Jazz Saxophonist and Composer, Is Dead
The world of jazz has lost a legend with the passing of Jimmy Heath, the renowned saxophonist and composer who died on January 19, 2020, at the age of 93. Known for his distinctive sound and virtuosity on both the tenor and soprano saxophones, Heath was a pioneering figure in modern jazz, playing with many of the greats of the genre throughout his long and illustrious career.
Born in Philadelphia in 1926, Heath grew up in a musical family and began playing the saxophone at an early age. He and his brothers, bassist Percy and drummer Albert “Tootie” Heath, would go on to become one of the most celebrated families in jazz, with each sibling achieving great success in their own right.
Heath’s early influences included Lester Young and Charlie Parker, and he quickly established himself as a gifted player in his own right. He played with a number of prominent jazz bands in the 1940s and 1950s, including those led by Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Art Blakey, and his solos on classic recordings like “Afro-Cuban” and “Kind of Blue” are still studied and admired by jazz musicians today.
In addition to his work as a sideman, Heath was also an accomplished composer, penning a number of jazz standards over the years. Some of his best-known compositions include “Gingerbread Boy,” “For Minors Only,” and “CTA,” which he wrote while playing with the Gillespie band.
Throughout his career, Heath remained an active and innovative force in the world of jazz. He continued to record and perform well into his 80s and 90s, collaborating with younger musicians and pushing the boundaries of the genre. He was also a respected educator, teaching at a number of institutions including Queens College and the Jazzmobile program in Harlem.
Heath’s legacy in jazz is immeasurable. He was a gifted musician, a pioneering composer, and a tireless ambassador for the genre. He will be deeply missed by his many fans, fellow musicians, and students, but his contributions to jazz will live on for generations to come.
