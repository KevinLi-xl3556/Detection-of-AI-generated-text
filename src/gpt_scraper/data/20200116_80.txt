Marion Chesney, who was best known for her mystery novels written under the pen name M.C. Beaton, passed away on December 30, 2019, at the age of 83. Her death was confirmed by her publisher, Little, Brown Book Group in London.
The Scottish-born author began her writing career in the mid-1970s, penning romance novels under different pseudonyms, such as Sarah Chester, Helen Crampton, and Ann Fairfax. She switched to mystery writing in the late 1980s and created two popular series: the Hamish Macbeth mysteries and the Agatha Raisin mysteries.
The Hamish Macbeth series featured a rural Scotland police constable who used his common sense and intuition to solve crimes in his community. The series was adapted into a BBC television series starring Robert Carlyle in the lead role.
Chesney’s other popular series, the Agatha Raisin mysteries, followed a retired public relations executive who solved murders in her village in the Cotswolds. The books were adapted into a television series in 2014, starring Ashley Jensen.
Over her long writing career, Chesney wrote more than 160 books under her various pen names, with many of her works translated into multiple languages. She was a recipient of the British Crime Writers’ Association’s Dagger in the Library Award in 2006.
Chesney was known for her witty writing style, quirky characters, and twisty plotlines that kept readers guessing until the end. Her fans were loyal and dedicated, and many expressed their condolences on social media after learning of her passing.
Her publisher released a statement saying, “We are saddened by the news of Marion Chesney’s passing. She was a wonderful storyteller who brought joy and entertainment to millions of readers around the world. Her legacy will live on through her writing and the memories she created for her fans.”
