The Trump administration’s decision to weaken environmental regulations could have disastrous consequences for the United States’ natural resources and public health. The ramifications of these actions could result in a bleak future for Americans whose health and well-being are dependent on clean air, water, and sustainable ecosystems.
President Trump has focused on rolling back environmental regulations since his first term in office. In 2017, his administration began efforts to repeal and replace the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era initiative aimed at decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The administration also withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, which committed nations to reduce their carbon emissions.
The Trump administration’s latest efforts aimed at environmental deregulation involve a series of executive orders signed in June 2020 to suspend or weaken more than 100 environmental safeguards. These changes include gutting the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires that federal agencies assess the environmental impact of proposed projects such as highways and pipelines before they are approved.
The weakening of NEPA requirements means that the public will have less knowledge and input on the environmental impacts of such projects before they are approved. This lack of transparency threatens to leave the public in the dark about the potential risks to their health and the environment.
Another move by the Trump administration will allow companies to ignore the effects of climate change on their proposed projects. This change means that projects such as pipelines, coal mines, and drilling operations would no longer require an examination of the long-term environmental and public health impacts related to climate change.
Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also proposed a new rule that would restrict the type of research used to justify federal regulations, limiting the amount of scientific evidence used to make decisions. This proposed rule has faced criticism from health and science experts who believe that the limitations will significantly undermine the science used to protect public health.
Critics of these deregulatory actions argue that limiting transparency and ignoring climate change will prevent the public from adequately protecting itself from environmental harm. The weakening of environmental rules jeopardizes the future of clean air and water, renewable energy, and the public’s health.
In conclusion, the Trump administration’s efforts to cut environmental regulations put the interests of businesses before those of the public. Weakening environmental protections will leave the public in the dark about the potential harms of proposed projects, endanger public health, and put future generations at risk. Therefore, it is vital for policymakers to prioritize protecting the environment and public health over the interests of businesses to ensure that we leave a sustainable future for the next generation.
