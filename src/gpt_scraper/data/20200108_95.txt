Dried fruit

Fruits are naturally sweet, and dried fruits, in particular, are a fantastic alternative to sweets or refined sugars. They contain natural sugar, fiber, and significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. Unlike carb-heavy sweets or candied fruits, dried fruits don’t have added sugars or preservatives, making them healthy for snacking. A small serving of dried fruits can satisfy your sweet cravings without spiking up your blood sugar levels, which in turn lets you maintain steadier energy levels throughout the day.

Oats

Oatmeal is a popular breakfast option for many individuals, and it’s an excellent carb source for those trying to avoid added sugars. Oats contain a fiber called beta-glucan, which helps slow down the absorption of carbs in your digestive tract, reducing blood sugar levels. Moreover, oats are also nutrient-rich, containing essential vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy.

Coffee

Coffee is a classic breakfast drink that can satisfy your sweet cravings without adding unnecessary sugar to your diet. Many types of coffee, such as a cappuccino or latte, contain milk, which contains natural sugar lactose. Moreover, coffee has a naturally sweet taste as well that comes from its roasted beans. If you want to take this even further, you can use sugar substitutes like stevia or monk fruit sweetener to sweeten your coffee.
