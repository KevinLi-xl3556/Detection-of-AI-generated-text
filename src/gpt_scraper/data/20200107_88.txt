Nicky Haslam is a well-known interior designer and socialite who has worked with some of the most prominent figures in the worlds of fashion, music, and art. However, it’s not just his glamorous clients that have made him a household name - it’s also his stunning homes. One of his most famous residences is known as the “House of Commons”, located in the heart of London. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at this iconic property and explore what makes it so special.
The House of Commons is a Georgian townhouse located in the exclusive district of Belgravia. Built in the early 19th century, the property was originally a private residence before being converted into a series of offices in the mid-20th century. When Haslam purchased the property in 1980, it was in a state of disrepair, with many of its original features stripped away.
Over the next several years, Haslam set about restoring the House of Commons to its former glory. He worked tirelessly to source antique furniture, artwork, and accessories, scouring auction houses and flea markets to find the perfect pieces. He also employed a team of skilled craftsmen to carry out painstaking restoration work on the property’s original architectural features, such as the ornate plasterwork and marble fireplaces.
The result of Haslam’s efforts is a breathtakingly beautiful home that seamlessly blends Georgian elegance with contemporary style. The property’s grand entrance hall features a sweeping staircase and marble flooring, while the reception rooms are adorned with sumptuous fabrics, antique furniture, and impressive works of art. Haslam’s signature eclectic style is evident throughout the house, with unexpected touches such as a taxidermy peacock and a pair of giant bronze candelabras.
One of the most striking features of the House of Commons is its stunning garden. Tucked away behind the property, the garden is a verdant oasis in the heart of the city. Haslam has filled it with a variety of exotic plants and flowers, as well as a pond and a charming summerhouse. It’s the perfect spot for entertaining guests or simply enjoying a moment of peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of London.
Despite its grandeur, the House of Commons is not a stuffy or formal property. Haslam has imbued it with a sense of warmth and personality, making it a welcoming and comfortable home. He is known for his love of entertaining, and the house has played host to many memorable parties over the years. From intimate dinner parties to lavish balls, Haslam knows how to create a magical atmosphere that leaves his guests enchanted.
In many ways, the House of Commons is a reflection of Haslam himself - stylish, eclectic, and full of life. It’s a home that has been shaped by its owner’s passion for design and love of beauty. It’s a testament to what can be achieved when creativity, dedication, and a deep appreciation for history and craftsmanship are brought together.
In conclusion, Nicky Haslam’s House of Commons is not just a beautiful home - it’s a masterpiece. It’s a testament to the power of design and the importance of preserving our architectural heritage. It’s a place where history, art, and culture come together in perfect harmony.
