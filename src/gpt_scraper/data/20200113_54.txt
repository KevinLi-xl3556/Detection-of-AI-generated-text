The New Jersey Devils have recently undergone a major change in their hockey operations, with the hiring of a new general manager, and a new role for one of their legendary players, Martin Brodeur. These changes mark a new chapter for the Devils and their efforts to re-emerge as one of the top teams in the NHL.
Tom Fitzgerald was named general manager on July 9, 2020, after serving as interim GM since January of the same year. Fitzgerald was a former player for the Devils, having played for them from 2005-2008. He has since held various positions within the organization and has been instrumental in the development of the team’s young prospects.
With Fitzgerald as the new GM, the Devils are looking to get back to their winning ways. The team has missed the playoffs for two consecutive seasons and has not won a playoff series since 2012. The organization has a young core of players that have shown promise, and it will be up to Fitzgerald to continue their development while bringing in the necessary pieces to make the team competitive.
One of the most significant moves made by Fitzgerald was the promotion of Martin Brodeur to the position of executive vice president of business development. In this role, Brodeur will be responsible for overseeing the development of the team’s business operations, including ticket sales, sponsorships, and marketing.
Brodeur is considered one of the greatest goaltenders in NHL history, with three Stanley Cup championships and four Vezina Trophies to his name. He spent the majority of his playing career with the Devils, and his contributions as a player and now an executive are highly valued by the organization.
Brodeur’s new role is a significant departure from his previous position as the team’s assistant general manager, where he was involved in scouting and player evaluation. However, the move is a testament to his leadership abilities and business acumen.
The Devils are optimistic about the changes in their management and are looking to build a winning culture that will last for years to come. The organization has made significant investments in their young talent, and with the guidance of Fitzgerald and Brodeur, they are hoping to reap the rewards of their efforts.
In conclusion, the New Jersey Devils have a new general manager in Tom Fitzgerald and a new role for Martin Brodeur. These changes are part of the team’s efforts to build a winning culture and become a competitive force in the NHL once again. With their young core of players and the guidance of their experienced leadership, the future looks bright for the Devils.
