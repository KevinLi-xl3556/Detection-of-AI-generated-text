In recent news, the world has witnessed the devastating losses of Iranian commanders Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a targeted U.S. air strike. As the funerals for these slain commanders were conducted in Iraq, cries of “revenge is coming” could be heard from the mourners gathered in attendance.
The targeted killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis has reignited tensions between the United States and Iran, with both sides engaged in a war of words and threats. Many fear that the situation could escalate into a full-blown war, as Iran has vowed to retaliate for the loss of their top military commander.
The funerals themselves were attended by tens of thousands of people, with many of the mourners being members of the powerful Iran-backed militia group known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). The PMF played a crucial role in the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq, and Soleimani was seen as a key figure in building up the group’s military capabilities.
Throughout the funeral proceedings, cries of “revenge is coming” could be heard from the crowd, as well as chants of “death to America”. The Iranian government has also vowed to exact revenge for the death of Soleimani, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dubbing the U.S. strike as a “criminal act” that would be met with “harsh revenge”.
The situation remains tense, with the United States sending additional troops to the region and warning of a potential Iranian attack. Meanwhile, Iran has vowed to continue its nuclear program and pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal, further escalating tensions between the two countries.
It is a tragic time for both Iran and Iraq, as well as the wider region. The loss of Soleimani and al-Muhandis is a blow to the fight against terrorism and has left a power vacuum in the PMF that could lead to further instability in Iraq. The cries of “revenge is coming” only serve to remind us of the high stakes involved in this conflict and the potential for it to spiral out of control.
As the world watches and waits anxiously for the next move in this tense situation, one can only hope that cooler heads will prevail and that a peaceful resolution can be found before more lives are lost.
