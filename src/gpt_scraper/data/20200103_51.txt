As the holiday season comes to a close and the New Year begins, many of us are left feeling the effects of indulging in delicious holiday meals and treats. However, January doesn’t have to be a month of deprivation and strict diets. Hosting a dinner party that is both delicious and healthy is a great way to start the year off on the right foot.
Here are some tips for hosting a January dinner party that doesn’t deprive:


Plan a menu with nutritious ingredients: Instead of heavy, calorie-laden dishes, opt for nutrient-dense ingredients like roasted vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Incorporate seasonal produce like kale, butternut squash, and pomegranates for added flavor and nutrition.


Offer healthy appetizers: Instead of traditional cheese and crackers or chips and dip, offer lighter options like hummus and veggies, baked sweet potato chips, or bruschetta made with whole-grain bread and fresh tomatoes.


Serve a signature cocktail with a healthy twist: Instead of sugary mixed drinks, offer a signature cocktail made with fresh ingredients like citrus and herbs. For example, a grapefruit and rosemary gin fizz or a vodka and cucumber mojito.


Use smaller plates and portion sizes: Studies have shown that using smaller plates can help reduce calorie intake without feeling deprived. Offer smaller plates and portion sizes to help guests feel satisfied without overeating.


Offer healthy dessert options: Instead of rich, calorie-laden desserts, offer lighter options like fresh fruit, a fruit sorbet, or a fruit and yogurt parfait.


Encourage physical activity: After the meal, encourage guests to take a walk or engage in a physical activity like dancing or yoga. This can help burn off some of the calories from the meal and promote overall health and wellness.


By following these tips, you can host a January dinner party that doesn’t deprive. Your guests will leave feeling satisfied and nourished, and you can start the year off on a healthy note. So, gather your friends and family, put on some music, and enjoy a delicious and nutritious meal together.
