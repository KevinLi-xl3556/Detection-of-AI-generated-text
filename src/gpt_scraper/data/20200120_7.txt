Her latest project, a collaboration with the iconic fashion house Dior, has resulted in an incredible masterpiece. Her monumental Goddess sculpture for Dior has captivated the audience with its sheer brilliance and grandeur.
The sculpture is an ode to the power of femininity, and it features a seated goddess figure measuring over three meters tall, surrounded by symbols of femininity such as flowers, iridescent beads, and butterflies. The figure is designed to represent the innate strength and beauty of women, as well as the central role of women in the world.
The sculpture is a part of a collaboration between Dior and Judy Chicago that aimed to explore the idea of female empowerment through art.

The result of this collaboration is a stunning and thought-provoking sculpture that pays homage to the female form and its divine energy.
The creation of the sculpture was a true effort of teamwork, with Judy Chicago working closely with Dior’s artisans, including couture seamstresses, embroiderers, and other skilled workers. The creation was a long and complex process, taking nearly a year to complete, with every detail meticulously planned out and executed. The sculpture was constructed using various techniques such as metal casting, embroidery, and beading, resulting in a magnificent masterpiece that reflects the true essence of femininity.
The sculpture was debuted at the unveiling of the Dior Couture Spring-Summer 2020 collection, amid much fanfare and adoration. The collection was inspired by nature and its various elements, and the Goddess sculpture was the perfect complement to it. The sculpture was displayed in a specially designed pavilion that included a garden inspired by the five elements of nature, adding another layer of symbolism to the already existing themes of femininity and the divine.
The sculpture has garnered a lot of attention and praise in the art world, with critics and art enthusiasts alike lauding it for its sheer brilliance and its message of female empowerment. It has also sparked conversations about art and fashion collaborations, and the potential of such collaborations to create truly unique and significant works of art.
In conclusion, Judy Chicago’s monumental Goddess sculpture for Dior is a true masterpiece, a celebration of femininity and the power of the female form.
