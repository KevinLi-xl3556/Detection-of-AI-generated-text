The San Francisco 49ers put on a dominant display against the Minnesota Vikings to advance to the NFC Championship game, winning 27-10. The 49ers have been one of the most consistent teams in the NFL this season, and they showed why in their Divisional Round game against the Vikings. Here’s how they did it.
Defense Wins Championships
The 49ers defense was the key to their victory. They were aggressive and relentless, making it difficult for the Vikings to get anything going. The Vikings were held to just 147 total yards of offense, with only 7 of those yards coming on the ground.
The 49ers defensive line, led by Nick Bosa, was dominant all game long. They sacked Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins six times, and hit him eight more times, making him uncomfortable and disrupting his rhythm.
The 49ers secondary also played a crucial role in the victory. They were disciplined and didn’t allow any big plays down the field. Cornerback Richard Sherman had an interception in the third quarter that led to a 49ers touchdown, and the Vikings never recovered from that.
Running Game Sets the Tone
The 49ers offense didn’t need to do much, thanks to the dominance of their defense. However, they did enough to control the game and keep the Vikings on their heels.
Running back Tevin Coleman was the star of the show, rushing for 105 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries. His first touchdown came in the second quarter, on a 1-yard run that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead. His second touchdown came in the fourth quarter, on a 2-yard run that put the game out of reach.
Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo didn’t have a great game statistically, but he managed the game well and didn’t make any mistakes. He finished the game completing 11 of 19 passes for 131 yards.
The 49ers offensive line also deserves credit for their performance. They controlled the line of scrimmage and opened up holes for Coleman and the other running backs.
Looking Ahead
The 49ers will now face the winner of the other Divisional Round game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game. The 49ers have already beaten both of these teams this season, but they know that anything can happen in the playoffs.
If the 49ers continue to play the way they did against the Vikings, they will be tough to beat. Their defense is one of the best in the league, and their running game can control the clock and wear down opposing defenses.
The 49ers are just two wins away from their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2012 season. With the way they are playing right now, they have to be considered one of the favorites to win it all.
