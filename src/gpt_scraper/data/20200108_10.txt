In a recent episode of the Modern Love podcast, actress and comedian Jenny Slate reads “Need to Find Me? Ask My Ham Man,” a personal essay by writer and lawyer Risa Nye.
The essay explores the ways in which food can bring people together and create a sense of community. Nye describes her relationship with her local ham man, a vendor at her local farmers’ market who sells high-quality meats and cured meats. Over time, Nye develops a close friendship with the ham man, who becomes a source of comfort and stability in her life.
Throughout the essay, Nye reflects on the ways in which food and relationships are intertwined. She writes, “I’ve come to realize that the ham man is not just a purveyor of meat, but a provider of comfort and joy. He represents a connection to a larger community, a reminder that we are all connected by the things we eat and the people we share them with.”
Slate’s reading of the essay is heartfelt and engaging. She captures Nye’s voice and tone perfectly, bringing the essay to life and making it feel like a personal conversation between friends.
As with all episodes of the Modern Love podcast, “Need to Find Me? Ask My Ham Man” offers a poignant and insightful look at the complexities of love, relationships, and human connection. Through Nye’s essay, listeners are reminded of the power of food to bring people together, and the importance of seeking out those connections in our own lives.
Overall, this episode of the Modern Love podcast is a must-listen for anyone who has ever found solace and community in the shared experience of food. It’s a reminder that even in difficult times, there are still ways to connect with others and find joy in the world around us.
