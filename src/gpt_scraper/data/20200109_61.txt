For over three decades, Pope.L, also known as William Pope.L, has been creating thought-provoking and often provocative works of art that challenge our notions of race, class, and identity. While he may be best known for his “crawls,” where he crawls across public spaces in a makeshift superhero costume, there is much more to Pope.L’s art than this one performance piece. So, what makes Pope.L’s art endure? It’s not just the famous crawls.
One of the things that make Pope.L’s art stand out is his willingness to tackle difficult and often uncomfortable subjects. His work explores issues such as race, poverty, and inequality head-on, using humor, irony, and absurdity to subvert our expectations and challenge our assumptions. For example, in his “Eating the Wall Street Journal” performance, Pope.L literally eats the financial news, highlighting the absurdity of a system that puts profit above all else.
Another aspect of Pope.L’s art that makes it enduring is its ability to create a sense of community and collective experience. Whether it’s through his public performances or his installations, Pope.L’s art often encourages interaction and participation from viewers, creating a shared experience that transcends individual perspectives. In his 2019 installation “Choir,” for example, Pope.L invited members of the public to sing together in a large-scale performance, creating a sense of unity and connection that is rare in contemporary art.
Pope.L’s use of language is also a significant aspect of his work. His use of puns, double entendres, and wordplay adds a layer of complexity and nuance to his art, challenging viewers to think more deeply about the ideas he is exploring. In his installation “The Black Factory,” for example, Pope.L creates a mock factory where visitors can purchase “blackness” in the form of jars of soil and other materials, highlighting the commodification of race and the ways in which identity is often reduced to a product to be bought and sold.
Finally, one of the most enduring aspects of Pope.L’s art is his ability to adapt and evolve over time. While his crawls may be his most famous work, Pope.L has continued to push the boundaries of contemporary art in new and unexpected ways. From his early street performances to his more recent installations and sculptures, Pope.L’s art remains relevant and thought-provoking, speaking to the social and political issues of our time in ways that are both challenging and inspiring.
In conclusion, while Pope.L’s crawls may have brought him to the attention of the art world, it is his willingness to tackle difficult subjects, create a sense of community and shared experience, use language in innovative ways, and adapt and evolve over time that makes his art enduring. As we continue to grapple with issues of race, class, and identity in our society, Pope.L’s art remains a powerful and necessary voice, challenging us to think more deeply about the world around us and our place in it.
