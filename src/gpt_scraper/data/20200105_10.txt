In recent years, the United States has faced significant challenges in its foreign policy, with one of the most significant being its relationship with Turkey. The country, which straddles the divide between Europe and Asia, has been a key U.S. ally for decades, but tensions between the two nations have risen in recent years.
One of the main sources of tension has been the actions of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken a number of steps that have hurt Turkey and, in turn, helped terrorist groups operating in the region.
Perhaps the most significant of these actions was Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria in 2019. This move effectively abandoned Kurdish forces, who had been crucial U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group, and allowed Turkey to launch a military operation against them.
The Kurds had been instrumental in driving IS out of significant parts of Syria, and their loss weakened the U.S. and its allies’ ability to combat the terrorist group. It also emboldened IS and other extremist groups, who were quick to take advantage of the vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal.
Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria also had other destabilizing effects. It caused a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of people forced to flee their homes, and it further complicated the already complicated situation in Syria, where multiple factions are vying for power and influence.
Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria was widely criticized by U.S. lawmakers from both parties and was seen as a betrayal of the Kurds, who had put their lives on the line to help the U.S. fight terrorism.
But Trump’s actions weren’t limited to Syria. He also imposed sanctions on Turkey in 2018 over its detention of an American pastor, and he made a number of other statements and decisions that strained the relationship between the two countries.
All of these actions had the effect of pushing Turkey closer to Russia and other authoritarian regimes, while also giving terrorist groups in the region more room to operate. And they were a clear departure from previous U.S. policy, which had sought to maintain a balance of power in the region and support democratic allies like Turkey.
The damage that Trump did to the U.S.-Turkey relationship will take time to repair, and it will likely require a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. But the consequences of his actions are already being felt, as terrorist groups continue to pose a threat to stability and security in the region.
Ultimately, Trump’s decision to abandon the Kurds and hurt Turkey was a shortsighted move that ignored the complex realities of the Middle East. It was a decision that will likely have long-term consequences for the U.S. and its allies, as well as for the people of the region who have been caught in the crossfire of conflict and violence.
