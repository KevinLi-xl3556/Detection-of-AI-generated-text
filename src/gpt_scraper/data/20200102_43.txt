Richard Plepler, the former head of HBO, is returning to the spotlight as part of a new deal with Apple. Plepler left HBO in early 2019 after serving as its CEO for nearly a decade, but now he is set to make a comeback in a big way.
Apple has reportedly signed a five-year deal with Plepler’s new production company, Eden Productions, to create original content for the tech giant’s streaming service, Apple TV+. The deal, which is said to be worth several hundred million dollars, is a major coup for Plepler and his team.
Plepler is no stranger to creating hit shows, having overseen the production of HBO’s hugely successful series like “Game of Thrones,” “Veep,” and “The Sopranos.” With his new company, he plans to continue that track record of excellence and bring high-quality programming to Apple’s platform.
In a statement about the deal, Plepler expressed his enthusiasm for the opportunity to work with Apple. “I’m excited to be partnering with Apple, a company that is at the forefront of innovation and creativity in the world of entertainment,” he said. “Together, we will create content that is both engaging and thought-provoking, and I can’t wait for audiences to see what we have in store.”
This partnership is just the latest in a string of high-profile moves by Apple to establish itself as a major player in the streaming world. The company has invested heavily in creating original content, including shows like “The Morning Show” and “Ted Lasso,” which have been well-received by audiences and critics alike.
For Plepler, the deal with Apple represents a chance to reassert himself as a major force in the entertainment industry. Since leaving HBO, he has kept a relatively low profile, but this new partnership puts him back in the spotlight and gives him the opportunity to once again create groundbreaking television.
Overall, the deal between Apple and Eden Productions is a significant development in the ongoing battle for dominance in the streaming space. With Plepler at the helm, Apple is sure to produce more high-quality programming that will help the company continue to build its reputation as a major player in the industry.
