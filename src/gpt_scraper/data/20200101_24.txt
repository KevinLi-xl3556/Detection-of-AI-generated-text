Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, with an estimated 10 million people infected and 1.5 million deaths annually. Although the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been available since the 1920s, it is only partially effective and does not provide long-lasting immunity against TB. However, a new injection method has been developed that makes the old TB vaccine far more powerful.
The new method, called ID93+GLA-SE, was developed by scientists at the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) in Seattle. It involves combining the BCG vaccine with a protein called ID93 and an adjuvant called GLA-SE. An adjuvant is a substance that enhances the body’s immune response to a vaccine.
In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers tested the ID93+GLA-SE vaccine in mice and found that it provided much better protection against TB than the BCG vaccine alone. The vaccine also provided longer-lasting protection, with the mice remaining immune to TB for at least six months after vaccination.
The researchers then tested the vaccine in non-human primates and found that it was safe and provided even better protection against TB than the BCG vaccine alone. The vaccine stimulated the production of immune cells called T-cells, which are critical for fighting TB.
The IDRI is now planning to conduct human trials of the vaccine to determine its safety and effectiveness in humans. If the trials are successful, the ID93+GLA-SE vaccine could become an important tool in the fight against TB, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic.
Dr. Steven Reed, the President and Chief Scientific Officer of IDRI, said, “The ID93+GLA-SE vaccine holds great promise as a new tool to prevent tuberculosis, which is a major public health threat worldwide. We are excited to move forward with clinical trials to evaluate the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in humans.”
The development of the ID93+GLA-SE vaccine is a significant breakthrough in the fight against TB, which has been a major health problem for decades. If the vaccine proves effective in human trials, it could help to reduce the incidence of TB and save countless lives around the world.
