In a shocking discovery, seven bodies were found in a religious sect in Panama, with 15 more people being held captive. The sect, known as “The New Light of God,” was located in a remote part of Panama’s indigenous Ngäbe-Buglé region. The authorities raided the compound after receiving reports of abuse and mistreatment of its members.
The New Light of God is a religious group that has been active in Panama for several years. The group’s leader, known as “Mother God,” reportedly convinced her followers that she was a god and had a special mission on earth. The members of the sect were forced to cut ties with their families and friends and live in isolation within the compound.
The authorities discovered the bodies of seven people, including a pregnant woman, who had been buried in a makeshift grave on the compound. The 15 people found in captivity were all reported to be in poor health and were taken to the hospital for treatment. The survivors told authorities that they had been held against their will and subjected to physical and emotional abuse.
The discovery of the sect has shocked the people of Panama and raised concerns about the dangers of religious cults. The authorities have arrested several members of the group, including the leader “Mother God,” who is a 35-year-old woman from the United States.
The case has also brought attention to the issue of human trafficking in Panama. The survivors reported that they had been brought to the country from different parts of the world and were forced to work for the sect without pay.
The government of Panama has promised to investigate the case thoroughly and bring those responsible to justice. The authorities have also urged the public to report any suspicious activities and to be vigilant about the dangers of religious sects.
This tragic incident is a reminder of the importance of protecting vulnerable communities and promoting awareness about the dangers of religious cults. It is essential to educate people about the signs of cults and the tactics they use to recruit members. By doing so, we can prevent similar incidents from happening in the future and protect the safety and well-being of our communities.
