In November 2019, Joe Burrow stood at the podium after his Louisiana State University football team had just defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks, 56-20. In his post-game press conference, Burrow spoke of the hunger that had fueled him and his teammates all season long.
“I mean, we’ve been hungry all year,” Burrow said. “Hungry for respect, hungry for a championship, and we’re not done yet.”
As Burrow spoke those words, his hometown of Athens, Ohio, felt the lift. Athens is a small town in southeastern Ohio, with a population of just over 24,000. It’s a college town, home to Ohio University, but it’s also a town with a high poverty rate and limited economic opportunities.
Burrow grew up in Athens and attended Athens High School, where he was a star quarterback. He went on to play college football at Ohio State University before transferring to LSU in 2018.
But even though Burrow was no longer living in Athens, he still felt a deep connection to the town and its people. And when he spoke of hunger, he spoke not just for himself and his LSU teammates, but for the people of Athens as well.
Athens has long struggled with poverty and economic hardship. The town’s poverty rate is nearly twice the national average, and many residents work low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement. But when Burrow and his LSU teammates won the national championship in January 2020, Athens felt a sense of pride and hope that it hadn’t felt in a long time.
“It’s amazing to see someone from our community achieve such great success,” said Athens Mayor Steve Patterson. “Joe has been an inspiration to so many people here, and we’re all incredibly proud of him.”
But Burrow’s success isn’t just a source of inspiration for Athens residents. It’s also a reminder that even in the face of adversity, success is possible.
“We may be a small town, but we have a lot of heart,” said Athens resident Cindy Jones. “Joe’s success shows us that if you work hard and believe in yourself, you can achieve anything.”
Burrow’s success has also brought attention to Athens and the struggles that its residents face. In the wake of his national championship win, several national media outlets ran stories about the town and its economic challenges. And while some residents worry that the attention will be fleeting, others see it as an opportunity to bring lasting change to the community.
“We’ve been struggling for a long time,” said Athens resident Marcus Thompson. “But maybe now people will start paying attention and we can get some help.”
As for Burrow, he’s still keeping an eye on his hometown. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, he donated $500,000 to the Athens food bank to help struggling families put food on the table. And even as he prepares for his second season with the NFL’s Cincinnati Bengals, he knows that his success is about more than just football.
“I want to be someone who inspires people,” Burrow said. “Not just on the football field, but in life. And if I can do that, then I’ll feel like I’ve accomplished something truly meaningful.”
