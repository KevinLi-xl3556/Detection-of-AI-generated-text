The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is often referred to as the highest court in the land, and rightly so. It has the power to interpret the Constitution, making it one of the most influential and consequential branches of the government.
However, this year has been a tumultuous one for the SCOTUS, with multiple justices stepping down and new ones being nominated. With so much change and uncertainty, one cannot help but wonder: who will be left standing in the Supreme Court?
Firstly, let’s take a look at the current composition of the SCOTUS. Currently, there are nine justices on the bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices. Of these eight, five were nominated by Republican presidents and three by Democratic presidents.
The SCOTUS has traditionally leaned conservative, but this balance could be at risk with the recent retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a crucial swing vote on many key issues. President Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacant seat has sparked fierce debate, with many questioning his conservative views and suitability for the role.
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, he will likely tip the balance of the court to the conservative side, with a potential 5-4 conservative majority. This could have significant implications for a range of political and social issues, from health care and abortion to gun control and LGBTQ rights.
However, the future makeup of the SCOTUS may not be as clear-cut as some believe. With several aging justices on the bench, retirement or unexpected health issues could result in new vacancies and nominations.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a stalwart liberal on the court, is 85 years old and has faced recent health issues. Some have speculated that she may consider retiring while a Democratic president is in office, allowing them to nominate a like-minded successor.
Additionally, Justice Stephen Breyer is 80 years old, and Justice Clarence Thomas is 70. While both have shown no signs of stepping down, their advanced age raises the possibility of new vacancies in the near future.
Given the unpredictable nature of politics and the SCOTUS, it is difficult to say who will be left standing in the Supreme Court. What is certain, however, is that the court’s makeup will have significant consequences for the direction of the country on a range of issues.
As Justice Sonia Sotomayor once said: “We are commanded to leave the world a better place than when we found it…Your job is to make that better world happen…” The members of the SCOTUS have been given a privileged and critical role in this process - and it remains to be seen who will be joining them in this monumental task.
