“Party of Five” is a reboot of the popular 90s drama series of the same name. The show follows the Acosta family, who are forced to navigate life after their parents are deported to Mexico.

The show’s creators have said that they hope to spark conversations and raise awareness about the struggles that immigrant families face in America.
On the other hand, “Crashing” is a comedy series that follows the life of struggling comedian Pete Holmes.

It explores the highs and lows of trying to make it in the comedy world, from open mics to sold-out shows. The show features a mix of famous comedians and up-and-coming talent, including Sarah Silverman, Artie Lange, and Jamie Lee.
