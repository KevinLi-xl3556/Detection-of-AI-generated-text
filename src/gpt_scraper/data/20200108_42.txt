The Oscars have always been a highly anticipated event in the entertainment industry, with millions of people tuning in to watch their favorite stars take home the coveted golden statuette. This year’s awards season, however, was marked by controversy and scandal, culminating in what many are calling the wildest week in Oscar history.
Despite the pandemic, the Oscars managed to take place in a hybrid format, with some attendees appearing in person while others joined virtually. However, as the night unfolded, it became apparent that the biggest story of the evening wasn’t the winners themselves, but rather the troubling pattern that emerged in the results.
Many were disappointed by the lack of diversity among the winners, with the majority of awards going to white, male artists. While there were a few notable exceptions, such as Yuh-Jung Youn’s win for Best Supporting Actress, the lack of recognition for artists of color and women was hard to ignore.
This lack of diversity is not a new issue in the entertainment industry, but it was particularly pronounced this year. In addition to the lack of diversity among the winners, there were also several instances of questionable behavior from nominees and attendees alike.
For example, one of the biggest controversies of the night was the nomination of musician and accused sexual abuser Marilyn Manson for Best Original Song. Despite widespread criticism, the Academy refused to remove Manson from the nomination list, sending a troubling message to survivors of sexual abuse and assault.
Additionally, there were multiple instances of presenters and winners making tone-deaf comments or jokes that fell flat with audiences. From jokes about the pandemic to awkward moments on stage, the overall tone of the evening was one of discomfort and unease.
So, what can we take away from this year’s Oscars? While there were certainly some positive moments, such as Chloe Zhao’s historic win for Best Director, the troubling patterns and controversies of the evening cannot be ignored.
It’s clear that the entertainment industry still has a long way to go in terms of diversity, inclusion, and accountability. While the Academy has taken steps to address these issues in recent years, there is still much work to be done to ensure that artists from all backgrounds are recognized and celebrated for their contributions to the industry.
Furthermore, it’s important for those in positions of power within the industry to take a hard look at their own behavior and the behavior of those around them. The Oscars should be a celebration of talent and creativity, not a platform for those who have caused harm or perpetuated harmful stereotypes.
In the end, the troubling takeaways from this year’s Oscars serve as a reminder that the entertainment industry has a responsibility to do better. By listening to marginalized voices, holding individuals accountable for their actions, and actively working to create a more inclusive and diverse industry, we can ensure that the Oscars of the future are truly a celebration of the best in film and entertainment.
