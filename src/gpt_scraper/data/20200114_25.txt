New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo recently visited Puerto Rico to assess the damage caused by the earthquakes that hit the island in recent months. During his visit, he strongly criticized President Trump’s response to the crisis, calling it “woefully inadequate.”
Cuomo traveled to Ponce, one of the worst-hit areas, where he met with local officials and residents. He pledged New York’s support to help the island recover, including sending donations and dispatching personnel to assist with relief efforts.
In a press conference held during his visit, Cuomo spoke out against the Trump administration’s slow response to the earthquakes. “It’s unconscionable that we have a president who continues to neglect the people of Puerto Rico, who are American citizens,” he said.
Cuomo also criticized Trump’s decision to divert funds approved by Congress for Puerto Rico’s recovery from Hurricane Maria to finance the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. “It’s an insult to the people of Puerto Rico, who are still suffering from the ravages of Maria, and now the earthquakes,” he added.
The New York governor has been a vocal critic of Trump’s handling of the island’s recovery efforts since Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory in 2017. He has repeatedly called for increased federal funds to be allocated to Puerto Rico, to help rebuild its infrastructure and bolster its economy.
Cuomo’s visit comes amidst ongoing protests on the island, fueled by frustration over the lack of progress in rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Maria, and the slow response to the recent earthquakes. The protests led to the ousting of former governor Ricardo Rosselló last year. The current governor, Wanda Vázquez, has faced criticism for her management of the crisis.
Cuomo’s visit to Puerto Rico is a reminder of the urgent need for the federal government to step up its response to the island’s ongoing recovery efforts. The people of Puerto Rico deserve better than neglect and underfunding from their own government. It’s time for the Trump administration to prioritize the safety and well-being of all Americans, including the residents of Puerto Rico.
