In a major shift for the entertainment industry, Disney has officially dropped “Fox” from the names of two of the studios it acquired from media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The 20th Century Fox film studio will now be known as 20th Century Studios, while Fox Searchlight Pictures will be rebranded as just “Searchlight Pictures.”
The move comes as no surprise, as Disney has been slowly distancing itself from the Fox brand since its acquisition of the studios and other assets from the Murdoch empire in 2019. Disney has already closed down Fox 2000, the studio responsible for producing hit films like “The Fault in Our Stars” and “Life of Pi,” and has scaled back production at 20th Century Fox.
The decision to drop “Fox” from the studios’ names reportedly comes from a desire to distance the studios from Murdoch’s conservative Fox News network, which has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years. The new names are also said to be more reflective of the studios’ identities and histories.
While the new names may take some getting used to for longtime fans, there is little doubt that the studios will continue to produce high-quality films under their new monikers. 20th Century Studios, in particular, has a storied history that dates back to the early days of Hollywood, and has been responsible for classic films like “Gone with the Wind” and “The Sound of Music.”
For Disney, the rebranding is just another step in its ongoing efforts to consolidate and streamline its many brands and properties. With the company’s recent launch of its Disney+ streaming service, and its upcoming slate of Marvel and Star Wars projects, the future looks bright for the media giant.
It remains to be seen how the rebranding will impact the success of the studios’ upcoming films, but with Disney’s resources and marketing muscle behind them, the new names are sure to be a hit with audiences around the world. So whether you’re a die-hard fan of the old Fox brands, or just curious to see what the studios will produce under their new names, be sure to stay tuned for what’s next from 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures.
