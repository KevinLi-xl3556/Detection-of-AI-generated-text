The Oscar nominations for 2020 have been announced, and the list of nominees is packed with some of the year’s most critically acclaimed films and performances. As always, there are a few surprises, a few snubs, and a lot of excitement over who will take home the coveted golden statuettes on the big night.
This year’s nominees for Best Picture are a diverse mix of genre-defying films that have earned praise from critics and audiences alike. Leading the pack is “Joker,” the gritty and controversial comic book adaptation that explores the origins of the iconic villain. Also in the running are “1917,” the World War I epic that wowed audiences with its technical achievements, and “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” Quentin Tarantino’s nostalgic ode to Tinseltown in the 1960s.
Other Best Picture nominees include “Parasite,” the darkly comedic drama from South Korea that has been making waves on the festival circuit, and “Marriage Story,” a nuanced exploration of divorce and family that has earned praise for its performances from Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Rounding out the category are “Little Women,” Greta Gerwig’s acclaimed adaptation of the classic novel, and “Ford v Ferrari,” the adrenaline-fueled true story of a team of engineers and race car drivers who built a car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans.
In the race for Best Director, the nominees include some heavy hitters. Martin Scorsese earned his ninth nomination for “The Irishman,” his sprawling crime epic that reunites him with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Quentin Tarantino also earned his second nod in the category for “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” while Bong Joon-ho earned his first for “Parasite.” Rounding out the category are Sam Mendes for “1917” and Todd Phillips for “Joker.”
In the acting categories, there were a few surprises and a few snubs. Jennifer Lopez, widely predicted to earn a nomination for her performance in “Hustlers,” was shut out, as was Lupita Nyong’o for her dual role in “Us.” Florence Pugh, however, earned her first nomination for her performance in “Little Women,” while Scarlett Johansson earned nominations in both the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, for “Marriage Story” and “Jojo Rabbit,” respectively.
The Best Actor category features some heavy-hitters as well, including Joaquin Phoenix for “Joker,” Leonardo DiCaprio for “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” and Adam Driver for “Marriage Story.” They are joined by Jonathan Pryce for “The Two Popes” and Antonio Banderas for “Pain and Glory.”
Overall, the Oscar nominations for 2020 are shaping up to be a contentious and exciting race. With such a varied field of nominees, it’s anyone’s guess who will come out on top on the big night. But one thing is for sure: these films and performances are all well-deserving of recognition, and it will be a pleasure to see them celebrated at the most prestigious awards ceremony in Hollywood.
