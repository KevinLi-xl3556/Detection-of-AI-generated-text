The Golden Globes is one of the most prestigious awards shows in Hollywood, and every year, the stars come out in full force to celebrate their achievements. One of the most beloved actors in the industry, Tom Hanks, has been a frequent attendee at the Golden Globes over the years. However, he recently made headlines for a surprising reason: he delivered a stern warning to those attending the show this year.
In a recent interview, Hanks urged all attendees of the Golden Globes to arrive on time. “Don’t be late,” he said. “The Golden Globes are a very important event, and it’s disrespectful to the organizers and your fellow actors if you show up late. It’s also just not a good look.”
Hanks, who has won multiple Golden Globes throughout his career, knows a thing or two about the importance of punctuality. He emphasized that being on time is not only a matter of etiquette, but also crucial for the success of the event. “There are a lot of moving parts to a show like this,” he said. “If everyone shows up on time, it helps everything run smoothly and ensures that the audience has a great experience.”
The actor also pointed out that being punctual shows respect for one’s colleagues. “If you’re late, you’re essentially saying that your time is more important than everyone else’s,” he said. “That’s not a good attitude to have, especially in an industry where collaboration is key.”
Hanks’ warning comes at a time when Hollywood is still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry has had to adapt to new safety protocols and restrictions, and events like the Golden Globes have had to adjust accordingly. The show, which was originally scheduled for January 2021, was postponed until February 2022 due to the pandemic.
With this in mind, Hanks emphasized the importance of taking responsibility for one’s actions and respecting the protocols in place. “We’re all in this together,” he said. “If we want to continue having events like the Golden Globes, we need to do our part and follow the rules. That includes showing up on time.”
In the end, Hanks’ warning is a reminder that even the biggest stars in Hollywood need to show up on time and be respectful of others. The Golden Globes may be a glamorous and exciting event, but it’s also a professional one, and punctuality is key to its success. As Hanks said, “Don’t be late.”
