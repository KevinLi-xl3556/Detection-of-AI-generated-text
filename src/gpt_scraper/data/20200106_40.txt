In a landmark case, Britain’s ‘Most Prolific Rapist’ has been sentenced to life imprisonment for his heinous crimes. Reynhard Sinaga, a 36-year-old Indonesian national, was found guilty of 159 offences against 48 men, making him the most prolific rapist in British legal history.
Sinaga’s crimes took place over a period of two and a half years in Manchester, where he lured young men to his flat under the pretence of offering them a place to stay after a night out. Once there, he drugged and raped them, often filming the assaults on his mobile phone. The victims were often unaware of what had happened to them until they were shown the footage by the police.
The trial, which lasted for four months, heard how Sinaga had used a variety of tactics to lure his victims into his flat, including posing as a Good Samaritan by offering them a place to stay or pretending to be a taxi driver. He would then ply them with alcohol and drugs, including GHB, a powerful sedative, before assaulting them.
The extent of Sinaga’s crimes only came to light when one of his victims regained consciousness during an assault and managed to escape. The police subsequently found evidence of his other attacks when they searched his flat, including dozens of mobile phones containing footage of the assaults.
Sinaga, who had been studying for a PhD at the University of Manchester, was arrested in June 2017 and has been in custody ever since. He was convicted of all charges against him at three separate trials, with the final verdict coming in January 2020.
The judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, described Sinaga as “an evil serial sexual predator” and said that he was a danger to the public. She ordered that he serve a minimum of 30 years in prison before being considered for parole, but acknowledged that he may never be released.
The case has sparked outrage and disbelief in Manchester, with many questioning how Sinaga was able to carry out his crimes for so long without being detected. The police have defended their handling of the case, saying that it was one of the most complex and challenging investigations they have ever conducted.
The trial has also raised important questions about the use of drugs in sexual assault cases and the need for greater awareness and education around the issue. GHB, also known as liquid ecstasy, has become increasingly popular among young people in recent years and is often used as a date rape drug.
In response to the case, the University of Manchester has launched a review of its student accommodation procedures and has called on other universities to do the same. The city council has also announced plans to install more CCTV cameras in the city centre in an effort to deter crime.
The sentencing of Reynhard Sinaga marks the end of a long and painful chapter for his victims and their families. It also sends a powerful message that sexual violence will not be tolerated in any form, and that those who perpetrate such crimes will be brought to justice, no matter how long it takes.
