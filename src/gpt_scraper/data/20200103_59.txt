The new HBO series ‘The New Pope’ has been causing quite a stir in the entertainment world, with its stunning visuals, intricate storyline, and impressive cast. However, one aspect of the show that has been grabbing the most attention is the portrayal of the titular character by none other than John Malkovich. Malkovich’s performance has been receiving rave reviews, with many critics and fans alike noting that he looks strikingly similar to the real-life Pope Francis.
The show, which is a sequel to the critically acclaimed series ‘The Young Pope,’ follows the election of a new pope after the death of Pope Pius XIII. Malkovich plays the new pontiff, Sir John Brannox, an English aristocrat who is chosen to lead the Catholic Church. Throughout the series, we see Brannox struggling to balance his duties as a religious leader with his personal desires and flaws.
Malkovich’s performance has been praised for its nuance and complexity, with many viewers noting how he embodies the character’s conflicting emotions and struggles. In particular, his physical resemblance to Pope Francis has been noted by many, with some even jokingly calling him “Pope Malkovich.”
However, Malkovich himself has downplayed the significance of his resemblance to Pope Francis, stating in an interview with The Guardian that “it’s just a coincidence.” He went on to explain that he approached the role not by trying to mimic the real-life pope’s mannerisms or appearance, but by focusing on the character’s internal struggles.
Despite his modesty, Malkovich’s performance has garnered significant attention, with many fans and critics hailing it as one of the standout performances of the year. His ability to embody a complex and conflicted character has only solidified his status as one of Hollywood’s most talented actors.
Of course, ‘The New Pope’ is not just about Malkovich’s performance. The series as a whole has been praised for its stunning visuals, its intricate and engaging storyline, and its impressive ensemble cast. From Jude Law’s dynamic performance as Pope Pius XIII to the stunning cinematography and production design, ‘The New Pope’ is a masterful piece of television.
Overall, ‘The New Pope’ is a must-watch for fans of high-quality television. While Malkovich’s performance may be the standout feature, the show as a whole is a triumph of storytelling, acting, and visual design. Whether you’re a fan of religious dramas, political intrigue, or just good old-fashioned storytelling, ‘The New Pope’ is definitely worth your time.
