The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, has created a wide range of issues that will impact various aspects of daily life, including travel. In this article, we will explore how Brexit is set to affect travel to the UK and Europe, from visas to air travel.
Visas and travel documents
Visas and travel documents are fundamental aspects of international travel to consider. With the UK now outside of the EU, travelers from the EU and other countries will need to check whether they need a visa or travel authorization to visit the UK. The good news is that EU citizens will be able to travel visa-free, providing they have a biometric passport.
For visitors coming from outside the EU, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan, there will be little change. Visitors will continue to require a visa or ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) to travel to the UK.
Air Travel
Brexit will undoubtedly impact the aviation industry, as the UK and the EU negotiate new arrangements to continue air travel between destinations. However, this is expected to be a priority for negotiation, and it is likely that air travel will continue with minimal disruption.
One issue that could impact air travel is the market access arrangements, which could change the number of airlines operating between the UK and the EU. It remains to be seen how this will impact travelersâ€™ choices, but the most popular routes and airlines are likely to remain largely unaffected.
Passports
Passports are another essential aspect of travel that could be affected by Brexit. Since 1 January 2021, UK passport holders have been unable to use European Union lanes at passport control but will need to use the same lane as other non-EU travelers.
For travelers, it now means a little more time spent at customs for security checks when they enter and leave EU countries. The passport must also have an expiration date of no less than six months to enter many countries outside the EU.
Healthcare
One aspect of travel that could be impacted is healthcare. UK nationals currently enjoy reciprocal health care arrangements when traveling in the EU. Still, these arrangements are set to end, meaning that travelers will need to ensure they have adequate travel insurance in place and check for any potential new medical costs they could incur.
Final Thoughts
In conclusion, the impact of Brexit on travel to the UK and Europe is still being felt, and many details are still being worked out. It is essential to keep up to date with the current travel requirements and changes in regulations to ensure a comfortable, stress-free trip. While some aspects of travel will be impacted, it still may not significantly impact the enjoyment of travel to these beautiful destinations.
