As the summer season comes to a close, many publishers are releasing new paperbacks to keep readers engaged during the cooler months. Two such releases that are sure to capture the attention of literary enthusiasts are “The Schoolhouse Gate” by Justin Driver and “Ghost Wall” by Sarah Moss.
“The Schoolhouse Gate” takes readers on a journey through the history of school law in the United States. Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago, examines pivotal court cases that have shaped American education, from Brown v. Board of Education to recent cases concerning school shootings. Driver argues that the debate around education is not just about policy or funding, but about fundamental questions of fairness, equality, and justice. The paperback edition includes an afterword that reflects on the role of school law in the era of COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement.
“Ghost Wall,” on the other hand, is a haunting work of fiction that explores the collision between the past and present. Set in the UK, the novel follows Sylvie, a teenage girl who joins an anthropology class on a summer trip to a remote area where an ancient bog body was discovered. As the group tries to reenact the lives of Iron Age Britons, Sylvie becomes increasingly disturbed by the behavior of her father, a man obsessed with a romanticized view of the past. Sarah Moss’s evocative prose conveys both the beauty and brutality of the natural world, and her characters are complex and nuanced. The paperback edition includes a discussion guide for book clubs.
Both “The Schoolhouse Gate” and “Ghost Wall” tackle weighty topics with intelligence and sensitivity, making them perfect choices for readers who enjoy thought-provoking and insightful works. And with their new paperback editions, they are now accessible to a wider audience. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to add these two outstanding books to your reading list.
