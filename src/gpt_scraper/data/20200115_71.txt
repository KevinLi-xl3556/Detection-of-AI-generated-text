Jason Crow: Impeachment Manager Who Pressed to Launch Inquiry
Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger and now Congressman from Colorado, was elected to Congress in 2018, running on a platform of fighting for social justice, protecting the environment and working for the community. But in 2019, when the impeachment inquiry was launched against President Donald Trump, Crow took on a new role, that of impeachment manager.
Crow was one of seven impeachment managers selected by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to make the case for impeachment in the Senate. He played an instrumental role in the impeachment proceedings, pushing for a quick and thorough investigation into Trump’s alleged abuse of power regarding his dealings with the Ukrainian government.
Crow’s background as a military man with a history of serving in Iraq and Afghanistan was a major influence on his decision to support the impeachment inquiry. In an interview with NPR, Crow explained how his military background had shaped his political outlook and informed his decision to become an impeachment manager.
“I came from a culture where accountability is everything,” he said. “When you make a mistake, you own up to it. You take responsibility for it. And if you don’t, there are consequences. That’s just the way it is.”
Crow’s commitment to accountability was on full display during the impeachment proceedings. He argued vigorously for the need to hold the president accountable for his actions, and he pressed his fellow lawmakers to take impeachment seriously.
“I’m not here to play politics,” he said during a press conference before the impeachment vote. “I’m here to do my job, and that’s to protect the Constitution of the United States.”
Throughout the entire impeachment process, Crow remained steadfast in his determination to see it through. He spent countless hours preparing for the trial, pouring over documents and gathering evidence to support the case for impeachment. And when it was time to present the evidence to the Senate, he delivered a powerful and persuasive argument that ultimately helped convince several Republican senators to vote to convict the president.
For Crow, the impeachment proceedings were not just about removing the president from office. They were about upholding the Constitution, protecting the rule of law, and ensuring that no one, not even the president, is above the law.
“My oath is not to the President of the United States. It’s not to a political party. It’s to the Constitution of the United States,” he said during the impeachment proceedings. “And I will do everything in my power to protect and defend that Constitution, no matter the personal or political cost.”
In the end, the efforts of Crow and his fellow impeachment managers fell short of removing the president from office. But their effort will be remembered as a pivotal moment in American history, a moment when brave men and women stood up to defend the Constitution and the rule of law against a president who had abused his power.
For Jason Crow, it was a moment when his commitment to accountability and his military training came together to make a difference. And he has promised to continue fighting for what he believes in, no matter the cost. “I’m not a quitter,” he said. “I’m not somebody who is going to back down in the face of adversity. I will continue to fight for what I believe in, no matter the challenge.”
