For decades, the Netherlands has been known around the world as Holland, a name that is often used interchangeably with the country’s official name. However, in recent years, Dutch officials have been working to encourage people to use the correct name for their country, which is the Netherlands. But why is this important, and why do officials want people to forget about Holland?
First of all, it’s important to understand the difference between the Netherlands and Holland. The Netherlands is a country that is made up of 12 provinces, including North Holland and South Holland. These two provinces are often collectively referred to as Holland, but they only make up a small part of the country.
The use of the name Holland has been popularized in part because of the country’s rich history and cultural heritage. Amsterdam, one of the most well-known cities in the world, is located in North Holland, and the province is also home to popular tourist destinations like the Keukenhof gardens and the windmills of Kinderdijk. South Holland, meanwhile, is home to the city of Rotterdam, one of the busiest ports in the world, and The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government.
However, officials in the Netherlands have been concerned that the use of the name Holland can lead to confusion about the country’s identity and contribute to stereotypes. In a 2019 statement, the Dutch government said that “the Netherlands is more than just the two provinces of North and South Holland. It’s a diverse and innovative country with a rich history and culture, and we want to make sure that people understand that.”
One of the concerns is that the use of the name Holland can contribute to stereotypes about the country, such as the idea that it’s a place where everyone wears wooden shoes and eats cheese. By using the correct name for the country, officials hope to encourage people to think more broadly about what the Netherlands has to offer.
Another issue is that the name Holland is often used by businesses and organizations that have nothing to do with the country itself. For example, there are many companies around the world that use the name Holland in their branding, even if they have no connection to the country. By promoting the use of the correct name, officials hope to avoid confusion and ensure that the Netherlands is properly represented.
So what can you do to help? If you’re planning a trip to the Netherlands, try to use the correct name when referring to the country. Instead of saying that you’re going to Holland, say that you’re going to the Netherlands. And if you’re a business or organization that uses the name Holland in your branding, consider making the switch to the Netherlands instead.
Overall, the campaign to promote the use of the name Netherlands is about more than just semantics. It’s about ensuring that the country is properly understood and represented around the world, and that people can appreciate its rich culture and history beyond the stereotypes associated with the name Holland.
