On January 6, 2020, a picture went viral on social media and news outlets. The photo showed a chaotic scene featuring a group of people gathered around a statue in the United States Capitol Building. Many were trying to climb the statue, while others stood by, watching or taking photos. The question on everyone’s mind was: What’s going on in this picture?
The events leading up to this moment began months earlier, when a presidential election was held in November 2020. The incumbent president, Donald Trump, lost the election to the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. However, Trump disputed the election results, claiming without evidence that widespread voter fraud had occurred. He encouraged his supporters to protest and fight against the outcome.
On January 6, 2020, a joint session of Congress was scheduled to certify the election results and officially declare Joe Biden as the winner. Many of Trump’s supporters had traveled to Washington D.C. to protest this certification, and they gathered near the Capitol Building.
As the certification process was underway, Trump addressed his supporters at a rally nearby. He continued to falsely claim that the election had been stolen from him and that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the results by rejecting certain electoral votes. He urged his supporters to march to the Capitol and demand that Pence take action.
Shortly after Trump’s speech, a large group of his supporters marched to the Capitol Building and breached its security barriers. They proceeded to vandalize the building, shattering windows and breaking down doors. Many of them carried flags and signs in support of Trump. Some were armed with weapons.
Inside the building, Congress was in the process of certifying the election results. When news of the breach reached them, they were evacuated to a secure location. Meanwhile, the rioters made their way to the Senate Chamber and the offices of several lawmakers.
It was during this chaos that the photo in question was taken. The statue that the rioters were climbing was of John Stark, a general from the Revolutionary War. Despite the historical significance of the statue, the rioters seemed more interested in using it as a vantage point from which to take photos and videos of the scene.
The events of January 6, 2020, were shocking and unprecedented. The breach of the Capitol Building was a direct attack on American democracy, and it left the country reeling. In the aftermath of the riot, investigations were launched to determine who was responsible and what could be done to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Today, the statue of John Stark stands as a reminder of the events that took place on that fateful day. It also serves as a symbol of the resilience of American democracy in the face of adversity. The photo of the rioters climbing the statue may have gone viral, but it is a stark reminder of the chaos and violence that threatened to tear the country apart.
