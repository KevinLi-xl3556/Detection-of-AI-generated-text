As the Trump administration continues to target its trade war with China, there are signs that another trade battle is brewing, and this one could be with Europe.
President Trump has long criticized the European Union for what he sees as unfair trade practices, and he has threatened to impose tariffs on European goods in the past. While Europe has so far managed to avoid the worst of Trump’s trade wrath, recent events suggest that tensions between the two sides are rising.
One of the main issues that could spark a trade dispute is Europe’s plan to implement a digital services tax, which would levy a 3% tax on tech giants such as Google and Facebook. The Trump administration sees this tax as unfair and has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on European goods, including luxury cars and wine.
Europe, in turn, has warned that it will not back down, and the European Commission has begun working on a “hit list” of US goods that could be subject to retaliatory tariffs. The organization has stated that it will not be bullied into abandoning the digital services tax, and it remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond.
Another issue that could lead to a trade dispute is the ongoing disagreement over agricultural products. The EU has strict regulations on genetically modified crops and hormone-treated beef, which has led to a ban on these products in Europe. The US, on the other hand, sees these regulations as protectionist and has been pushing for more access to the European market for its agricultural goods.
The Trump administration has also expressed concern about Europe’s trade surplus with the US, which in 2018 stood at $169 billion. Trump has accused the EU of taking advantage of the US and has threatened to impose tariffs on European cars as a way to bring down the trade deficit.
While Europe has managed to avoid the worst of Trump’s trade policies so far, it appears that the relationship between the US and the EU is becoming increasingly strained. With the Trump administration taking a hardline stance on trade, it is likely that a trade dispute between the US and Europe is on the horizon.
If such a trade fight were to occur, it could have significant consequences for both the US and Europe. Tariffs on European goods would likely lead to higher prices for US consumers, while retaliatory tariffs on American goods would hurt US businesses that rely on the European market. The United States and Europe have long been important trading partners, and a trade dispute between the two could have far-reaching economic consequences.
Ultimately, the outcome of any potential trade dispute between the US and Europe remains to be seen. However, with tensions rising and both sides taking a hardline stance, it appears that a trade fight could be looming on the horizon.
