When most teenagers start an internship, they hope to gain some valuable experience in their chosen field. However, few can claim to have made a groundbreaking discovery during their time as an intern. That’s exactly what happened to high school student Wolf Cukier when he started his internship at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.
Cukier, a 17-year-old from New York, joined NASA’s team as a summer intern in 2019. He was assigned to work with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a mission designed to search for planets outside our solar system. Cukier’s job was to examine the brightness of stars that TESS was monitoring and look for any signs of a planet passing in front of them.
Just three days into his internship, Cukier noticed something unusual in the data. A star named TOI 1338 seemed to have two dimming patterns instead of the typical one. Cukier suspected that this could be caused by two planets orbiting the star, passing in front of it at different times. He alerted his mentor, who was initially skeptical but eventually agreed that Cukier had found something significant.
Further analysis confirmed that Cukier had indeed discovered a planet. But not just any planet – it was a circumbinary planet, meaning that it orbits two stars instead of one. This is a rare and exciting discovery that could help scientists better understand how planets form and evolve in binary star systems.
Cukier’s discovery was announced to the world in January 2020, and he became an overnight sensation. He was interviewed by media outlets from around the globe and received congratulations from fellow scientists and even celebrities like Mark Hamill and William Shatner. But Cukier remained humble, saying that he was just “in the right place at the right time” and that the discovery was the result of a team effort.
Cukier’s internship at NASA may have been brief, but it had a lasting impact. He inspired countless young people to pursue their passion for science and showed that anyone, regardless of their age or experience, can make a significant contribution to the field. He also demonstrated the power of curiosity and perseverance, reminding us that sometimes the most groundbreaking discoveries come from simply asking questions and exploring the unknown.
So, if you’re currently interning or working in a field you’re passionate about, take inspiration from Wolf Cukier’s story. Keep asking questions, keep exploring, and who knows – you might just discover something amazing too.
