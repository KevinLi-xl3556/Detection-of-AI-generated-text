Iran has officially announced an end to its commitment to the nuclear limits outlined in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The decision comes on the heels of the U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, which has ramped up tensions between Washington and Tehran to an all-time high, and has left the entire Middle East region on edge.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, was agreed upon by Iran and six world powers (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in 2015, and involved Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of economic sanctions. However, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and has since imposed maximum pressure sanctions on Iran.
Despite this, Iran had continued to abide by the terms of the deal until now, at least in part because the Europeans in the deal had been trying to keep it alive by creating a mechanism to circumvent the U.S. sanctions. However, the killing of Soleimani has altered this situation significantly, as Iran’s Supreme National Security Council said that the country would no longer respect any of the limits it had agreed to in the nuclear deal.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not observe any restrictions imposed on the development of its nuclear program, including limitations on enrichment capacity, percentage of enrichment, amount of enriched material and research and development,” the council said in a statement.
Iran’s decision to scrap the remaining conditions of the nuclear accord could accelerate its ability to develop nuclear weapons, which the country has repeatedly denied it intends to do. But the decision could also be seen as a move to exert further pressure on the U.S. and the other signatories of the deal to act to relieve the economic pressure the country is under.
Meanwhile, the killing of Soleimani has sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East, prompting fears of escalating conflict in the region. Iran quickly and publicly vowed to retaliate, leading to heightened U.S. security measures in the region, further threats from Iran, and the deployment of additional troops by the U.S. to the Middle East.
Ultimately, the situation remains tense and unpredictable, with the killing of Soleimani and the unraveling of the Iran nuclear accord potentially setting the stage for further instability in the already volatile region.
