After a pause of several months, the U.S. military has resumed joint operations with Iraqi forces, signaling a renewed commitment to security in the region. The announcement of the resumption of these operations was made by the U.S. military on Monday, following discussions between U.S. and Iraqi officials.
The joint operations had been temporarily suspended in January 2021, in response to a series of rocket attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq. The attacks, which were carried out by Iranian-backed militias, resulted in the death of a civilian contractor and injured several American soldiers. The U.S. military responded with airstrikes against these militias in Syria and Iraq.
The decision to resume joint operations comes at a time when the Iraqi government is facing multiple security challenges. These include ongoing attacks by ISIS militants, as well as political unrest and economic instability. The resumption of joint operations with the U.S. military is seen as a positive step towards improving security in the region.
In a statement, the U.S. military said that the resumption of joint operations with Iraqi forces was “an important step towards our shared goal of a secure, stable, and prosperous Iraq.” The statement also noted that the U.S. military would continue to provide “advice, assistance, and support” to Iraqi forces, including in the fight against ISIS.
The resumption of joint operations has been welcomed by the Iraqi government. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has described the move as a “positive step” towards improving security in the country. He also thanked the U.S. government for its continued support of Iraq’s security forces.
The decision to resume joint operations with Iraqi forces is part of a wider effort by the Biden administration to rebuild relationships with allies in the Middle East. The administration has made it clear that it intends to prioritize diplomacy and cooperation in its approach to foreign policy, rather than relying solely on military force.
However, the resumption of joint operations with Iraqi forces is likely to be controversial in some quarters. There are still many Iraqis who view the U.S. military presence in the country as an unwelcome intrusion, and who would prefer to see Iraqi forces take sole responsibility for security.
In conclusion, the resumption of joint operations between the U.S. military and Iraqi forces is a positive step towards improving security in the region. However, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome in order to achieve lasting stability in Iraq. The U.S. and Iraqi governments must work together to address these challenges and build a stronger partnership based on mutual respect and cooperation.
