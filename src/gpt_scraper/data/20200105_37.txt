Iraq, Australia, Golden Globes: Your Weekend Briefing
As we inch closer to the end of the first month of the new year, there have been significant developments in various parts of the world worth noting. From tensions in Iraq to the devastating bushfires in Australia and the highly anticipated Golden Globes ceremony, here is your weekend briefing.
Iraq:
The situation in Iraq remains tense following the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian military commander, in a US airstrike earlier this month. The aftermath of the strike saw Iran retaliate with missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq, which left no casualties. However, the tensions in the region continue to rise and are likely to remain high for the time being. The US embassy in Baghdad issued a warning to US citizens to depart Iraq immediately amid fears of further attacks.
Australia:
The wildfires in Australia continue to ravage the country, with over 12 million acres burned and 28 people killed so far. The bushfires have been largely attributed to the prolonged drought and high temperatures, which have made the countryâ€™s forests and grasslands extremely vulnerable to fires. The Australian government has pledged $2 billion towards bushfire recovery efforts, and international aid and support continue to pour in. In the face of this disaster, numerous individuals and organizations have come together to help those affected by the fires.
Golden Globes:
The 77th annual Golden Globes took place on Sunday night, celebrating the best of film and television from the past year. Hosted by Ricky Gervais, the ceremony featured a range of poignant speeches, heartfelt moments, and surprising wins. Some of the standout winners of the night included Joaquin Phoenix for Best Actor in a Drama for his role in Joker, Awkwafina for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her performance in The Farewell, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.
As we end another eventful weekend, let us continue to monitor the developments in Iraq, extend our support to those affected by the devastating bushfires in Australia, and celebrate the incredible achievements in film and television showcased at the Golden Globes.
