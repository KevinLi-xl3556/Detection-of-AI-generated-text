Judge John Hodgman is a renowned writer, comedian, and podcaster. Among his many strengths is his ability to weigh in on seemingly trivial disputes with humor and wisdom. Recently, Judge Hodgman turned his attention to the world of grocery store baskets, and what he discovered will surprise and amuse you.
For those who have never given much thought to the humble grocery basket, Judge Hodgman’s opinions on the matter are sure to be eye-opening. In a recent podcast episode, he tackled a case in which a couple was divided over the proper use of shopping baskets. One spouse argued that baskets should be carried with the handles facing out so that they could be easily loaded and unloaded from the grocery cart, while the other spouse insisted that the handles should be facing in for maximum carrying comfort.
Judge Hodgman approached the case with his trademark wit, but he also brought a surprising amount of insight to the matter. He noted that there are many different types of grocery store baskets, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some baskets are specifically designed to be stacked or nested, while others have compartments for delicate items like eggs or bread. In each case, the proper use of the basket depends on its specific design.
However, Judge Hodgman also acknowledged that there are cultural norms at play when it comes to grocery store baskets. In some places, it’s considered polite to carry a basket with the handles facing in so that it takes up less space in the aisle. In others, it’s common to see people using baskets as impromptu shopping carts, loading them up with heavy items and wheeling them around the store.
Ultimately, Judge Hodgman concluded that there is no one right way to use a grocery basket. Instead, he encouraged his listeners to be adaptable and to use their best judgment based on the situation at hand. Whether you’re using a stackable plastic basket at a discount store or a fancy woven basket at a gourmet market, the key is to be mindful of your surroundings and to make the most of the tools at your disposal.
In the end, Judge Hodgman’s insights into the world of grocery store baskets may seem like a minor thing, but they actually speak to a larger truth about the ways in which we navigate the world around us. By paying attention to the small details of our everyday lives, we can gain a greater understanding of the world as a whole.
