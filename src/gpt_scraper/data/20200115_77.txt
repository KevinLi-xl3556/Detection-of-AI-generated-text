Zoe Lofgren: Impeachment Manager Is a Veteran of Two Impeachment Inquiries
On January 6, 2021, a violent mob of rioters stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election. Following this alarming event, the House of Representatives decided to impeach the then-president, Donald Trump, for his role in inciting the riot. As a result, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed nine impeachment managers, including Representative Zoe Lofgren of California’s 19th district.
The appointment of Representative Lofgren is not surprising as she is a veteran of two previous impeachment inquiries of former Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Her experience and knowledge of the process make her a valuable asset to the team of House managers.
Zoe Lofgren’s career in politics began when she worked as a staff assistant to Congressman Don Edwards. In 1978, Lofgren ran for and won the California State Assembly seat, ultimately serving as the chair of the Judiciary Committee. She then went on to win the 16th district Congressional seat in 1995 and has held it ever since.
In 1998, Lofgren became a key player in the impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. She served on the House Judiciary Committee and eventually voted against all four articles of impeachment. Lofgren insisted that the articles were not supported by the evidence and the vote was based on politics instead of facts.
Lofgren also played a significant role in the impeachment inquiry against President Richard Nixon. During the Watergate scandal, Lofgren was a congressional staffer on the House Judiciary Committee, where she worked on articles of impeachment to be presented against the President.
Now, as an impeachment manager against President Trump, Lofgren brings her extensive experience to the table. In the case against President Trump, the House of Representatives has charged him with inciting an insurrection against the United States government. The managers are responsible for presenting evidence to the Senate, where Trump stands trial, to support the impeachment proceedings.
Representative Lofgren has made it clear that her goal is to uphold the Constitution and ensure accountability for those who have violated it. Her experience in previous impeachment inquiries provides her with valuable insights into the legal and political processes involved in impeachment.
In conclusion, Representative Zoe Lofgren’s appointment as an impeachment manager during the current proceedings is a testament to her extensive experience and invaluable contributions to previous impeachment inquiries. Her expertise and dedication to the Constitution will be vital in ensuring that justice is served.
