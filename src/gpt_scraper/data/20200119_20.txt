When the United States Space Force was established in December 2019, it immediately sparked conversations around its purpose and operations. However, one of the most talked-about aspects of the Space Force was its uniforms. While some applauded their sleek and futuristic design, others were quick to criticize.
The Space Force’s uniforms, designed by the army’s own combat uniform manufacturer, are primarily blue with a black element and a silver overlay. Many people compared them to something out of a sci-fi movie or a Halloween costume rather than an official military uniform.
But why all the fuss over a simple design? It’s not just about aesthetics; uniforms serve a crucial purpose in the military. They identify the wearer as a member of a specific branch, help establish order and discipline, and provide practical benefits such as camouflaging and protection.
For many, the Space Force’s uniform fails to meet these basic expectations. The decision to make them largely blue, a color often associated with air forces, seems at odds with the organization’s goals of exploring space beyond Earth’s atmosphere.
Furthermore, the silver overlay on the uniforms has been criticized for being too shiny and impractical, potentially making it difficult for Space Force members to remain hidden or blend in during missions. Some have even compared the silver accents to the popular trend of shiny “space blankets,” used to reflect sunlight for warmth during outdoor events.
It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time a new branch of the military has faced scrutiny over their uniforms. The Air Force’s original olive-green uniform was met with similar criticisms when the branch was first established in 1947. However, the Air Force listened to feedback and eventually updated their uniform to the iconic blue design that we know today.
The Space Force has the opportunity to learn from the Air Force’s experience and take feedback from members and the public into account when designing future uniforms. After all, uniforms are a critical aspect of how a military branch presents itself to the world.
In conclusion, while the Space Force may have taken a small step towards exploring space, their uniform design is not a giant leap for the organization. The public’s reaction to the uniforms shows that they are an important aspect of how the Space Force is perceived by the public, and it would be wise for the organization to take their feedback into account moving forward.
