In Paris, an Apartment Where Picassos Meet 17th-Century Antiques
Paris has long been known as a city of art and culture, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the apartment of Marie-Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. Located in the heart of the city’s historic Marais district, de Clermont-Tonnerre’s home is a stunning fusion of classic French style and contemporary art.
The apartment itself dates back to the 17th century, and its architecture and interior design reflect the grandeur and elegance of the era. But it’s what’s inside that truly sets this space apart. Every room is filled with a carefully curated collection of art and antiques, from priceless 17th-century furniture to striking modern paintings and sculptures.
One of the most impressive features of de Clermont-Tonnerre’s apartment is her collection of works by Pablo Picasso. The artist, known for his pioneering contributions to modern art, is widely considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. De Clermont-Tonnerre has acquired several of his pieces over the years, including paintings, drawings, and ceramics.
But what’s perhaps most interesting about the way she has integrated these works into her home is the way they coexist with the other antiques and furnishings. Rather than being relegated to a separate gallery space, the Picassos are displayed alongside the other pieces, creating a dialogue between the old and the new.
For example, in the living room, a colorful Picasso painting hangs above a stately 17th-century sofa. The two pieces couldn’t be more different in terms of style and medium, but together, they create a striking visual contrast that draws the eye and sparks conversation.
In the dining room, a contemporary chandelier made of translucent spheres hangs above a grand 17th-century table. The effect is both elegant and playful, as the modern fixture casts a soft glow over the antique furnishings.
De Clermont-Tonnerre’s approach to decorating her apartment is rooted in a deep appreciation for the beauty and history of each piece. She sees her home as a reflection of her own personal style, but also as a celebration of French art and culture.
The result is a space that feels simultaneously timeless and of-the-moment. Visitors to the apartment are struck by the way the different styles and eras blend together seamlessly, creating an atmosphere that is both sophisticated and welcoming.
For de Clermont-Tonnerre, the apartment is more than just a place to live; it’s a canvas on which to express her creativity and share her love of art and design with others. And for those lucky enough to experience it, it’s a truly unforgettable experience.
