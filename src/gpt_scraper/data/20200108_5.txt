Welcome to your Wednesday Evening Briefing, where we bring you the latest news from around the world. Today’s briefing covers a range of topics, including Iran’s nuclear program, the ongoing political crisis in Puerto Rico, and the latest developments in the British royal family.
Iran’s Nuclear Program:
Tensions continue to rise between Iran and the international community over Iran’s nuclear program. On Wednesday, Iran announced that it had started enriching uranium up to 60% purity, its highest level yet. The move comes in response to what Iran claims was an attack on its Natanz nuclear facility earlier this month. The attack, which Iran blames on Israel, damaged centrifuges and caused a power outage.
The United States and its allies have expressed concern over Iran’s increasing enrichment levels, with the US calling the move “provocative.” The US and Iran are currently engaged in indirect talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, which the US withdrew from under the Trump administration. The talks have been complicated by the recent attack on Natanz and Iran’s increased enrichment levels.
Puerto Rico Political Crisis:
Puerto Rico continues to face a political crisis, with protests erupting over the weekend after the discovery of unused emergency supplies in a warehouse in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. The supplies, which included water, food, and medical equipment, were meant for distribution to those affected by the earthquake, but were instead left unused for months.
The discovery of the supplies has led to renewed calls for the resignation of Puerto Rico’s governor, Wanda Vázquez. Vázquez, who assumed office last year after the resignation of former governor Ricardo Rosselló, has faced criticism over her handling of the earthquake recovery efforts and the COVID-19 pandemic.
British Royals:
In lighter news, the British royal family has announced that they will be taking part in a new initiative aimed at promoting mental health. The initiative, called “Mental Health Minute,” will see members of the royal family, including Prince William and Kate Middleton, participating in a minute-long broadcast encouraging people to talk about their mental health.
The announcement comes as the royal family continues to grapple with the fallout from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. In the interview, Harry and Meghan accused the royal family of racism and neglect, and revealed that they had considered suicide during their time as senior members of the family.
While the royal family has yet to publicly address the specific allegations made by Harry and Meghan, the Mental Health Minute initiative is seen as a step towards addressing the broader issue of mental health in the UK.
That concludes your Wednesday Evening Briefing. Stay tuned for more updates on these and other stories as they develop.
