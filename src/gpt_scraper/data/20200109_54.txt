Robert Kirkman, the creator of the wildly popular comic book series “The Walking Dead,” has done it again. This time, he’s surprised fans with a new comic book series that promises to be just as thrilling and unpredictable as his previous works.
The new series, titled “Invisible,” tells the story of Mark Grayson, a high school student who seems like an ordinary teenager on the surface. But when his father, a superhero named Omni-Man, reveals that Mark has inherited his own superpowers, Mark’s life takes a drastic turn.
What sets “Invisible” apart from other superhero comics is its focus on the personal struggles of its characters. Mark is forced to navigate his newfound abilities while also dealing with typical teenage problems like school, relationships, and family drama. Kirkman’s writing is as sharp as ever, blending humor, drama, and action in a way that keeps readers hooked from page one.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Kirkman comic without some twists and turns. Without giving too much away, let’s just say that Mark’s journey as a superhero is far from straightforward. The series introduces a wide array of characters with their own agendas and motivations, making it impossible to predict what will happen next.
“Invisible” is also notable for its stunning artwork by Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley. The characters are rendered in vivid detail, with dynamic panel layouts that bring the action to life. Whether it’s a high-flying battle between superheroes or a quiet moment between Mark and his mother, every scene is visually striking.
Fans of Kirkman’s previous work will no doubt be delighted by “Invisible,” but the series also has the potential to attract a whole new audience. Its focus on character development and its unpredictable storytelling make it a standout in the crowded superhero genre.
If you’re looking for a new comic book series to sink your teeth into, “Invisible” is definitely worth checking out. With Kirkman at the helm, you never know what surprises are in store.
