Welcome to your Monday briefing, where we will bring you up-to-date on the latest events happening around the world. Today, we will be focusing on the protests in Iran, the elections in Taiwan, and the latest developments in the ongoing Megxit saga.
Iran Protests:
The protests in Iran began on November 15, 2019, after the government announced a sudden increase in fuel prices. What started as a peaceful demonstration quickly turned violent, with protesters attacking government buildings and police stations. The Iranian government responded with force, using tear gas, water cannons, and even live ammunition to disperse the crowds.
As of today, the protests are still ongoing, and there have been reports of dozens of deaths and thousands of arrests. The Iranian government has blamed the unrest on foreign interference and has cut off access to the internet to prevent protesters from organizing.
The protests in Iran have garnered international attention, with many countries calling on the Iranian government to respect the rights of its citizens and allow them to express their grievances peacefully.
Taiwan Elections:
On January 11, 2020, Taiwan held its presidential and legislative elections. The elections were seen as a test of the island’s democracy and its relationship with China.
Incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was re-elected with a landslide victory, winning over 57% of the vote. Her main challenger, Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, received just over 38% of the vote.
The election results were seen as a rebuke to China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and has been ramping up pressure on the island in recent years. Tsai, who supports Taiwan’s independence, has vowed to defend the island’s sovereignty and resist China’s attempts to undermine its democracy.
Megxit:
In January 2020, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle announced that they would be stepping back as senior members of the British royal family. The move, which became known as “Megxit,” was met with shock and dismay by many royal watchers.
Since then, there have been many developments in the Megxit saga. In March 2020, Harry and Meghan moved to Los Angeles, and in September, they signed a multi-year deal with Netflix to produce documentaries, scripted series, and children’s programming.
In February 2021, Buckingham Palace announced that Harry and Meghan would not be returning as working members of the royal family. The couple responded with a statement expressing their disappointment but also their commitment to serving their communities.
The latest development in the Megxit saga came on April 19, 2021, when Prince Harry returned to the UK for the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip. His visit sparked speculation about a possible reconciliation with his family, but it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Sussexes and their relationship with the royal family.
In conclusion, these three events - the protests in Iran, the elections in Taiwan, and the ongoing Megxit saga - highlight the complex and interconnected nature of global politics. They also remind us of the importance of democracy, human rights, and the power of individuals to effect change.
