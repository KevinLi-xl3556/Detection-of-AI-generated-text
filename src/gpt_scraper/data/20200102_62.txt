Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro ended his presidential campaign on Thursday, citing a lack of resources and momentum. The news came less than a month before the Iowa caucuses, and just a day after another candidate, Marianne Williamson, also dropped out of the race.
Castro announced his decision in a video message posted on social media, saying “It’s with a heavy heart and with profound gratitude that I will suspend my campaign for president.”
The Texas Democrat had struggled to gain traction in a crowded field of candidates that included several other high-profile Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Castro spoke about the barriers he faced as a person of color, and how that had impacted his campaign. “I’ve relished every moment on this campaign trail, speaking about the issues that matter to Americans who have been left behind and forgotten,” he said. “But it simply isn’t our time.”
Castro’s campaign had been focused on issues such as immigration, education, and the rights of low-income Americans. He had proposed several significant policy changes, including a plan to decriminalize border crossings and a proposal for universal pre-kindergarten.
Despite his impressive resume and strong policy platform, Castro had struggled to make an impact in polls and fundraising. He had been consistently relegated to the lower tiers of the primary field, and had failed to qualify for the last two debates.
In his video message, Castro thanked his supporters and campaign staff, and vowed to continue fighting for the issues that he cares about. “I’ll keep working towards a nation where everyone counts, a nation where everyone can get a good job, good healthcare, and a decent place to live,” he said.
Castro’s exit leaves just over a dozen candidates in the Democratic primary race. The next debate, scheduled for January 14th, will feature just six candidates, reflecting the narrowing of the field as the primary process heats up.
Despite his disappointing finish, Castro’s campaign will be remembered for its message of inclusion and social justice. His decision to drop out of the race may be a disappointment to some supporters, but his progressive policies and inspiring message will continue to resonate with many Americans.
