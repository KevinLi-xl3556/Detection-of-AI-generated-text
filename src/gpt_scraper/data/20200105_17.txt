An Army Officer Says His Mother’s Deportation is ‘Completely Inhumane’
An army officer stationed overseas is devastated by the recent deportation of his mother, an undocumented immigrant. The officer, who wishes to remain anonymous, says the deportation is “completely inhumane” and calls for a change in immigration policies.
The mother, who had been living in the country for nearly 20 years, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in a raid on her workplace. Despite having no criminal record and living a productive life, she was quickly deported to her home country without the opportunity to say goodbye to her loved ones.
The army officer, who was at work at the time of the raid, received a call from his distraught father informing him of the deportation. “It was like a punch to the gut,” he said. “To know that my mother, who has been an integral part of my life, was taken away without warning. It’s a horrible feeling.”
He further added, “My mother was not breaking any laws; she was simply providing for her family by working hard every day. Deporting someone like her is cruel and inhumane.”
He also stressed that many undocumented immigrants contribute positively to American society and should not be criminalized or deported. With their hard work and dedication, they are contributing to the economy and the country’s progress. He reminded people that they are human beings, not just statistics on paper.
The officer went on to say that there needs to be a change in the current immigration policies. “The current system is broken, and it’s ruining lives. We need to create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are living productive lives in our communities.”
He also highlighted the need for compassion and understanding towards those who come to America seeking a better life. “My mother’s case is not an isolated example, and we should not turn a blind eye to the suffering of innocent families. A change in immigration policies is long overdue.”
The officer concluded his statement by urging people to be more empathetic towards immigrants and refugees. He emphasized that America has always been a land of opportunity for people seeking a better life, and the country must continue to embrace that vision.
The recent deportation of the officer’s mother is a stark reminder of the harsh realities faced by many immigrants in America. It’s time we address these issues compassionately and humanely.
