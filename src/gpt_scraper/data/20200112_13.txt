Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has accused Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of sending his volunteers to “trash” her during the 2020 Democratic primary campaign. Warren made the allegations in a recently published interview with CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360.”
The allegations first surfaced in January 2020, when CNN reported that Sanders had told Warren in a private meeting that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency. Sanders denied making the comment, but Warren confirmed it in a statement. The controversy led to a tense exchange between the two candidates during a presidential debate in Iowa, where Warren accused Sanders of calling her a liar on national television.
In the CNN interview, Warren said that the conflict with Sanders had gone beyond the disagreement over the alleged comment about a woman winning the presidency. She claimed that Sanders had also sent his supporters to “trash” her on social media and in other ways.
“Bernie knows me well enough to know that what he did was to basically let loose his followers on me,” Warren said. “He sent them out to trash me. And that’s a problem. We Democrats need to be better than that.”
Warren’s comments were met with a mixed response from the Democratic Party. Some of her supporters saw them as vindicating her claims that she had been targeted unfairly by Sanders and his supporters, while others criticized her for reopening old wounds in the party and distracting from efforts to unite behind the eventual nominee.
Sanders, for his part, has not yet responded directly to Warren’s latest allegations. However, in a statement released after the interview aired, he reiterated his commitment to defeating President Donald Trump and working to advance progressive policies.
“Let me be very clear: If Donald Trump is reelected, all the progressive policies that Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and others have fought for will be in jeopardy,” Sanders said. “We must come together to defeat him, and then we can continue the important work of building a more just and equitable society for all.”
The conflict between Warren and Sanders highlights the deep divisions that exist within the Democratic Party, particularly between its progressive and establishment wings. While both candidates share many of the same policy goals, their approach to achieving them and their vision for the party’s future differ in significant ways.
As the 2020 election approaches, Democrats will need to find a way to bridge these divides and present a united front against Trump and the Republicans. Whether they will be able to do so remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party is far from over.
