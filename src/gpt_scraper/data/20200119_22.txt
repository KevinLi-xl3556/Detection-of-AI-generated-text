2020 got off to a rocky start at the box office, with one film triumphing while another struggled to find its footing. “Bad Boys for Life,” the third installment in the popular action-comedy franchise, exceeded expectations and soared past the $100 million domestic box office mark in the first three days of its release. Meanwhile, “Dolittle,” a reboot of the classic tale with Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role, failed to capture the hearts of moviegoers and underperformed at the box office.
“Bad Boys for Life” stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as police detectives in Miami who are called upon to solve a string of murders that hits close to home. The film is jam-packed with explosive action sequences, witty banter between the two leads, and heartwarming moments that made the audience root for their favorite bad boys. The film also benefited from the brand recognition of the “Bad Boys” franchise, which has been dormant for nearly two decades.
The success of “Bad Boys for Life” can also be attributed to its release timing; it was the first major release of 2020 and followed a string of holiday releases that had already run their course. The film was well-reviewed and marketed aggressively, which helped to build buzz and anticipation.
“Dolittle,” on the other hand, struggled to find an audience despite boasting a star-studded cast and beloved source material. The film had a long, troubled production history, with multiple directors and script rewrites, which likely contributed to its lackluster reception. The film’s marketing was also confusing, with trailers emphasizing the film’s visuals over its story or characters, leaving potential audiences unsure of what to expect.
The film’s box office problems were compounded by negative reviews from critics and poor word-of-mouth from audiences who found the film to be lackluster and forgettable. Despite the film’s weak performance, it should be noted that the film did perform better internationally, where it earned expositions to box office revenue.
The success of “Bad Boys for Life” and failure of “Dolittle” highlights the importance of timing, marketing, and brand recognition at the box office. While quality is an important factor, a well-timed and marketed film can often deliver strong box office numbers despite being criticized by experts. Conversely, a poorly timed or marketed film can quickly find itself struggling, even if it has a strong story and performances.
In the end, film is a business, and the box office numbers are the ultimate indicator of success or failure. “Bad Boys for Life” proved that a well-timed and marketed franchise with strong leads can still capture the imagination of audiences, while “Dolittle” showed that even with a star-studded cast and beloved pedigree, a poorly executed film can fall flat.
