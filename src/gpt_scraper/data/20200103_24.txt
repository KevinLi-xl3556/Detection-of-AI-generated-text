On January 3rd, 2020, a United States airstrike in Baghdad, Iraq killed two powerful military figures: Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The assassination of Soleimani, who was the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, was met with widespread controversy and criticism. However, the killing of al-Muhandis, who was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), also had significant implications for the region.
The PMF, also known as Hashd al-Shaabi, is a coalition of mostly Shiite militias that was formed in 2014 to fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq. The group is officially recognized as a part of the Iraqi military and is backed by Iran. Al-Muhandis was a key figure in the PMF and was also a close ally of Soleimani. His death was a significant blow to the organization and to Iran’s influence in Iraq.
In the aftermath of the airstrike, the PMF vowed revenge against the United States. The group, which has been accused of carrying out numerous attacks against U.S. forces in the past, launched a series of rocket attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq. In response, the U.S. carried out further airstrikes against PMF targets, which led to further escalation.
The killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis also raised questions about the legality of targeted killings and the use of force in international relations. The U.S. justified the strike on the grounds of self-defense, claiming that Soleimani was planning imminent attacks on U.S. interests in the region. However, critics argued that the U.S. had violated international law by carrying out an assassination without the approval of the Iraqi government or the United Nations.
The airstrike also had significant political implications for both Iraq and Iran. In Iraq, the killing of al-Muhandis was seen as a direct attack on the country’s sovereignty and led to renewed calls for the expulsion of U.S. troops from the country. In Iran, the death of Soleimani was a major blow to the country’s prestige and led to widespread mourning and protests.
Overall, the airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis was a significant event that had far-reaching implications for the region. It sparked a new wave of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as well as between the U.S. and Iraq. It also raised questions about the legality of targeted killings and the use of force in international relations. The fallout from the strike is still being felt today, and its legacy will continue to shape the political landscape of the Middle East for years to come.
