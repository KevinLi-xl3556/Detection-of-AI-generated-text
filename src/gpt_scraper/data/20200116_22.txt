“How ‘Uncut Gems’ Creates Action Thrills at a School Play”
The Safdie brothers’ critical and commercial hit film “Uncut Gems” is a masterclass in tension and action, as protagonist Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) navigates the dangerous world of sports gambling and high stakes jewelry trading. But what happens when the Safdies’ signature style is applied to a decidedly more mundane setting: a middle school play?
In a recent viral Twitter thread, user @EmmettLarkin shared a video of their sister’s middle school production of “The Wizard of Oz,” edited with the pulsing score and frenetic camera work of “Uncut Gems.” The result is a surprisingly intense and engaging take on the beloved classic.
While the concept may seem gimmicky, the video highlights how effective the Safdie brothers’ filmmaking techniques can be in creating tension and excitement even in a seemingly benign scenario. The quick cuts, close-ups, and constant movement keep the audience on the edge of their seat, even as they watch preteen actors stumble over their lines.
This experiment raises an interesting question: could the Safdies’ style be used to invigorate other mundane scenarios, such as a heated family dinner or a quiet day at the office? It begs the even bigger question of how much the visual language of cinema can impact our perception of reality.
Of course, this is not to say that all films should adopt the frenzied style of “Uncut Gems.” Different stories call for different approaches, and there is certainly value in quieter, more contemplative works. However, this viral video serves as a reminder of the power of visual storytelling, and how a skilled filmmaker can elevate even the most mundane setting into something truly thrilling.
In the end, it doesn’t matter that the actors are preteens, or that the storyline follows Dorothy and her friends on a whimsical journey. With the right audio and visual cues, any setting can become an opportunity for action and excitement. The Safdie brothers’ creative techniques are a testament to the art of filmmaking, and show that there is always room for innovation and experimentation in the world of cinema.
