The multi-talented Awkwafina has taken on a new job as a subway announcer in New York City, and the public has mixed feelings about it. While some are delighted to hear her familiar voice on their daily commutes, others have raised concerns about the potential for distractions and safety hazards.
For those who aren’t already familiar with Awkwafina, she is a rapper, comedian, and actress who has gained a substantial following in recent years. Her breakout role was in the hit film “Crazy Rich Asians,” and she has since gone on to star in other movies and TV shows, as well as releasing music.
Now, New Yorkers riding the 7 train are greeted by Awkwafina’s distinctive voice announcing stops and reminding them to “stand clear of the closing doors.” Many have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the new addition to their commute.
Some commuters have expressed enthusiasm for the change, saying that Awkwafina’s humor and energy make their morning and evening rides more enjoyable. Others have pointed out that they appreciate hearing a familiar voice during a time of uncertainty and change, as New York City continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, not everyone is thrilled about the new subway announcer. Some have raised concerns about safety, arguing that her distinctive voice could be distracting to passengers who need to pay attention to their surroundings. Others have criticized the MTA’s decision to hire a celebrity for the job, rather than focusing on improving service and reliability.
Despite the mixed reactions, it’s clear that Awkwafina’s latest role has generated a lot of attention and discussion. As New York City continues to adapt and evolve, it’s likely that we’ll see more unconventional decisions like this one – and more diverse voices being heard in unexpected places.
