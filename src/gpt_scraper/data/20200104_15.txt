It was supposed to be a typical hunting trip in rural South Carolina for Bobby Joe Rogers and his daughter, Kimberly Kay Rogers. However, tragedy struck when they were both mistaken for deer and fatally shot by hunters in an adjacent hunting party.
South Carolina officials have since confirmed that the incident occurred on Wednesday, October 28th, 2020, in the woods alongside an ATV trail. According to reports, the father and daughter were making their way through the heavily wooded area when they were shot by hunters who were situated on an opposite side of a field.
The father, 30-years-old, and his daughter, 9-years-old, were both pronounced dead at the scene, while three hunters, including the one who reportedly fired the gun, were taken into custody by authorities.
The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the community, leaving many to question the safety measures in place for hunting in rural areas. Despite the fact that accidents of this nature are rare, it shows just how easily things can go wrong when firearms are involved.
Officials are urging hunters to ensure that their targets are in fact animals before pulling the trigger. The stateâ€™s Department of Natural Resources plans to investigate thoroughly and will announce its findings shortly.
This unfortunate incident is a harsh reminder of the importance of safety measures when hunting in rural areas. Hunting can be a fun and exciting activity but must be carried out with the utmost caution and care. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of Bobby Joe and Kimberly Kay Rogers.
