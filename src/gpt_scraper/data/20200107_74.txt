Musicals have long been a staple of theater, but now they’re making their way onto our TV screens. With the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, it’s easier than ever to watch your favorite shows and movies from the comfort of your own home. And now, with the introduction of TV’s new musicals, every episode is like opening night.
In the past, musicals were reserved for the stage. Shows like Hamilton and The Phantom of the Opera became cultural sensations, drawing in crowds from all over the world. But now, thanks to TV, the reach of musicals has expanded even further. No longer are these shows limited to those who can afford tickets to the theater. Now, anyone with a streaming subscription can experience the joy of a musical from the comfort of their own home.
One of the most popular TV musicals is Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. The show follows Rebecca Bunch, a successful lawyer who leaves her job in New York to follow her ex-boyfriend to California. Along the way, she breaks into song, expressing her innermost thoughts and feelings through music. The show has been praised for its catchy songs, clever writing, and its honest portrayal of mental health.
Another hit musical is Glee, which aired on Fox from 2009 to 2015. The show followed a high school glee club as they navigated the ups and downs of adolescence. Each episode was filled with covers of popular songs, as well as original musical numbers. The show became a cultural phenomenon, inspiring fans to start their own glee clubs and sparking renewed interest in musical theater.
More recently, Netflix has produced several successful musicals, including The Prom and Julie and the Phantoms. The Prom follows a group of Broadway actors who travel to a small town in Indiana to help a high school girl attend prom with her girlfriend. The show features catchy songs and a star-studded cast, including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and James Corden.
Julie and the Phantoms, on the other hand, is a family-friendly musical about a teenage girl who forms a band with three ghosts. The show features original songs and choreography, and has been praised for its diverse cast and positive messages.
But what is it about TV musicals that makes them so popular? For one, they’re accessible. Not everyone can afford to see a Broadway show, but almost everyone has a streaming subscription. TV musicals allow people to experience the joy and excitement of musical theater without leaving their homes.
TV musicals are also more episodic than traditional musicals. Each episode is like opening night, with new songs, new choreography, and new plot developments. This keeps viewers coming back for more, eager to see what will happen next.
Of course, not all TV musicals are created equal. Some shows, like Smash, failed to find an audience despite their star-studded casts and catchy songs. Others, like Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, were critically acclaimed but struggled to find a large enough audience to warrant renewal.
Despite the challenges, TV musicals are here to stay. With their accessibility, episodic nature, and ability to bring people together through music, they’re sure to continue captivating audiences for years to come. So grab your popcorn, settle in on the couch, and get ready for opening night.
