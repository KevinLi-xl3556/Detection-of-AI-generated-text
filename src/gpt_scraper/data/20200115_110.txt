President Donald Trump has finally achieved his long-awaited trade deal with China. After months of negotiations and tensions, the United States and China signed the Phase One trade agreement on January 15, 2020. While Trump is touting the deal as a victory for American workers and farmers, many experts believe that China came out as the biggest winner.
Under the agreement, China has agreed to increase its purchases of American goods and services by $200 billion over the next two years. This includes $50 billion worth of agricultural products, $75 billion worth of manufactured goods, $50 billion worth of energy products, and $40 billion worth of services. In return, the US has agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods and roll back some of the existing tariffs.
At first glance, this may seem like a significant victory for the US, as it is expected to benefit American farmers and manufacturers. However, some experts have pointed out that China’s commitments are not new and that the country would have increased its purchases of American goods even without the trade deal. Moreover, the trade deal only covers a small portion of the trade disputes between the two countries, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.
On the other hand, China’s biggest win is the partial rollback of tariffs imposed by the US. The US has agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 15% to 7.5% and refrain from imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods. This is a significant relief for Chinese manufacturers who have been struggling to cope with the tariffs and are facing job losses and shrinking profits. The reduction in tariffs is also expected to boost China’s economic growth, which has slowed down due to the trade disputes with the US.
Another aspect that favors China is that the trade deal does not address structural issues in the Chinese economy, such as the state-own enterprises, subsidies, and industrial policies. These issues have been a thorn in the side of American businesses, and the lack of progress on them has left many disappointed.
Furthermore, the US has given up some of its leverage by agreeing to a phase one trade deal, which means that it may be challenging to negotiate a comprehensive deal with China. The US may have to make more significant concessions to achieve a comprehensive trade deal with China, which could further favor China.
In conclusion, while President Trump may have achieved his trade deal with China, experts believe that it is China that has come out as the most significant winner. The partial rollback of tariffs will provide much-needed relief to Chinese manufacturers, and the US has given up some of its leverage by agreeing to a phase one deal. While the deal provides a temporary relief from the trade tensions between the US and China, experts believe that much work needs to be done to address the fundamental issues in the Chinese economy and to achieve a comprehensive trade deal that benefits both countries.
