Pig and Khao Chef Unveils Her Latest in Chelsea
Chef Leah Cohen, best known for her popular Southeast Asian restaurant Pig and Khao, has finally unveiled her latest creation in Chelsea. After months of anticipation, the doors to Piggyback NYC are officially open, and the culinary world can’t get enough of it.
Located on West 26th Street, Piggyback NYC is a modern American barbeque joint with twists and turns that can only come from a world-renowned chef like Cohen. Piggyback NYC offers a selection of classic dishes like brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, but the chef has elevated these humble dishes with her unique twist, adding unexpected flavors and textures that tantalize the taste buds.
Cohen’s passion for cooking began at a young age, and it’s evident in every dish she creates. She brings perfectionism and creativity to the kitchen, and the result is always an outstanding meal. Piggyback NYC is no exception, offering a variety of meats and sides that are bursting with flavor.
One of the highlights of the menu is the smoked brisket, cooked low and slow for 16 hours, then coated in Cohen’s special blend of spices. The result is perfectly tender meat that falls apart in your mouth. The pulled pork is another crowd-pleaser, slow-roasted with a delicious smoky flavor.
Of course, no barbeque joint would be complete without sides, and Piggyback NYC offers a variety that is just as impressive as the meat selection. The mac and cheese is one of the most popular, and it’s easy to see why – creamy and decadent, with a breadcrumb topping that gives it a satisfying crunch. The cornbread is another favorite, fluffy and slightly sweet, with a touch of honey that takes it to the next level.
The atmosphere at Piggyback NYC is equally impressive, with an industrial-chic decor that is both stylish and comfortable. The restaurant can comfortably seat up to 100 guests, and the bar offers an extensive selection of beer, wine, and cocktails.
In summary, Piggyback NYC is a must-visit for anyone looking for an unforgettable barbeque experience in New York City. Chef Leah Cohen has once again proved that her culinary skills are unparalleled, crafting a menu that showcases her passion for cooking and her creativity in the kitchen. So be sure to make a reservation and experience the magic of Piggyback NYC for yourself – you won’t regret it.
