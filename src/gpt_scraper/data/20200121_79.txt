Why These Australia Fires Are Like Nothing We’ve Seen Before
The catastrophic fires burning across Australia are not just a tragedy for the country, they represent an unprecedented and alarming event on a global scale. The scale, intensity and duration of the 2019–2020 bushfire season in Australia have been unlike anything seen before, with millions of hectares of land destroyed, at least 34 lives lost and one billion animals impacted. Here are some reasons why the current Australia fires are like nothing we’ve seen before.
Unprecedented Environment and Climate Conditions
The bushfires have been exacerbated by conditions that cannot be entirely attributed to global warming, such as an unusually strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole, which has led to hotter and drier conditions, and very strong winds that have helped to spread the fires. These weather conditions have helped create a perfect storm of drought, heat, and wind that helped to ignite and then spread the fires.
Size and Intensity of the Fires
The scale and intensity of the fires is staggering. Over 10 million hectares of land have been burned so far, which is over 6 times the size of the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and over twice the size of the California fires of 2018. The fires are so large that they are creating their own weather systems, with smoke plumes creating their own thunderstorms that could lead to lightning strikes, further igniting the fires.
Impacts on Flora and Fauna
The fires are also having a devastating impact on Australian wildlife, with an estimated one billion animals affected, injured, or killed by the fires. Many species are now at risk of extinction, including koalas, wallabies, and kangaroos. In some areas, it has been estimated that up to 80% of the koala population has been killed.
Human Toll
The bushfires have also taken a terrible toll on human lives, with at least 34 people killed and over 2,000 homes and buildings destroyed. Many communities have been completely devastated, and it is going to take years to rebuild and recover from the fires.
Global Impact
The Australia fires are not just a tragedy for the country, they are also having global impacts. The fires are releasing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, which is exacerbating global warming, and contributing to the climate crisis. The fires are also contributing to air pollution, which is affecting air quality in other countries, including New Zealand.
Conclusion
The scale, intensity, and duration of the Australia fires are unlike anything seen before. The fires are a stark reminder of the urgent need to address climate change, and to develop more effective strategies for responding to natural disasters. Australia has shown resilience in the face of adversity, but the country desperately needs more support and resources to address this crisis. We must learn from these events, and work together to prevent such disasters from occurring in the future.
