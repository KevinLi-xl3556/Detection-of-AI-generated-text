Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has recently admitted that he was wrong about his “stop and frisk” policy that he once championed. Despite this admission, the policy still haunts him, as it has left a lasting impact on the people who were affected by it.
In 2011, Bloomberg’s administration implemented the “stop and frisk” policy, which allowed police officers to stop, question, and search anyone they deemed suspicious without a warrant or probable cause. The policy was intended to reduce crime rates in high-crime areas of the city, but it disproportionately targeted black and Latino New Yorkers.
The policy resulted in thousands of unjustified stops, with the vast majority of those targeted being innocent of any wrongdoing. The NYPD even admitted that in 2012 alone, 90% of those stopped were innocent.
Bloomberg’s recent apology for the policy comes as he announces his run for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election. He has publicly stated that he regrets his support for the policy and that it was a mistake.
However, the damage done by the policy remains. Communities of color in New York City were left feeling violated and targeted by the very police officers who were supposed to protect them. The trauma caused by unjustified police stops cannot be erased by a simple apology, and many people are still living with the emotional and psychological aftermath.
Moreover, Bloomberg’s acknowledgment of his mistake comes after years of his continued defense of the policy. It was only after he left office in 2013 that he began to show signs of changing his stance on “stop and frisk.”
The fact that Bloomberg is now seeking the Democratic nomination for president also adds some complexity to his admission of fault. As he tries to gain the support of the party’s base, which includes many people of color, it is clear that his past support for “stop and frisk” will be a contentious issue.
Despite his apology, Bloomberg’s past policies and actions still matter. It is up to voters to decide if they are willing to forgive and move on from his past, or whether they believe that he should be held accountable for the harm caused by his policies.
In the end, the impact of the “stop and frisk” policy will be felt for years to come. While Bloomberg may have finally admitted that he was wrong, the damage done to communities of color will not be easily forgotten. It remains to be seen whether he can truly make amends for his mistake, both in New York City and on the national stage.
