Libya, Harry and Meghan, SpaceX: Your Monday Briefing
As we start a new week, let’s catch up on some of the top news stories from around the world.
Libya:
The situation in Libya continues to escalate, with the country in the midst of a civil war. The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) has accused the Libyan National Army (LNA) of carrying out a series of airstrikes on civilian targets in the capital, Tripoli.
The LNA, led by General Khalifa Haftar, launched an offensive to seize control of Tripoli in April 2019. Since then, the fighting has intensified, with both sides accused of committing war crimes.
The international community has called for a ceasefire and for both sides to return to political negotiations, but so far, the conflict seems to be far from over.
Harry and Meghan:
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made headlines last week after they announced their decision to step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family. The couple revealed that they plan to split their time between the UK and North America and become financially independent.
The royal family released a statement in response, saying that the situation was “complicated” and that it would take time to work through. The Queen has ordered senior members of the family to come up with a plan, and it’s expected that Harry and Meghan’s future roles will be announced in the coming weeks.
The decision has caused a great deal of debate and speculation, with many people offering their opinions on what it means for the future of the monarchy.

SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, successfully carried out a test flight of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Sunday. The unmanned spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and docked with the International Space Station (ISS) early on Monday morning.
The successful test marks a significant step forward for SpaceX and its goal of sending astronauts to the ISS in the near future. The company has been working on the development of the Crew Dragon spacecraft for several years and hopes to start sending manned missions later this year.
