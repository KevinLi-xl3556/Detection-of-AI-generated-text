Welcome to your Friday evening briefing! As the week comes to a close, we take a look at some of the top news stories making headlines around the world. Today, we’ll be discussing the latest developments in Iraq, the Methodist Church, and the Oscars.
Iraqi Elections and Political Instability
In Iraq, the country held its first parliamentary elections since the defeat of ISIS in 2017. However, the process was marred by low turnout and accusations of fraud. Many Iraqis feel disillusioned with their political leaders, who have failed to provide basic services and improve the country’s economy.
In addition to the elections, Iraq is facing a growing threat from militias backed by Iran. These militias have been accused of carrying out attacks against American and Iraqi targets, further destabilizing the country.
The Methodist Church and LGBTQ+ Rights
The United Methodist Church, one of the largest Protestant denominations in the world, is facing a potential split over LGBTQ+ rights. The church has been grappling with the issue for years, with some members pushing for greater inclusion and others advocating for a traditional view of marriage.
In 2019, the church narrowly voted to uphold a ban on same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ+ clergy. However, many churches and individual members have since openly defied the ban, leading to calls for a split.
The Oscars and Diversity in Hollywood
Finally, the Oscars are set to take place this Sunday, April 25th. This year’s ceremony has been hailed as one of the most diverse in the history of the awards, with several nominees of color and women in top categories.
However, some critics argue that the Oscars still have a long way to go in terms of diversity and inclusion. The lack of recognition for films like “Da 5 Bloods” and “One Night in Miami” has been a point of contention, and the Academy’s decision to include a controversial new “popular film” category in 2018 was widely criticized and ultimately scrapped.
As we end another week, it’s clear that the world continues to face complex challenges and pressing issues. From political instability in Iraq to debates over LGBTQ+ rights in the Methodist Church and diversity in Hollywood, it’s important to stay informed and engaged with the events shaping our world.
