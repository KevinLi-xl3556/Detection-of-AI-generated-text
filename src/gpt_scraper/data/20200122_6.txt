Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers Mascot, Is Accused of Punching a Boy in the Back
Gritty, the beloved orange furry mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers, is known for being feisty and high-spirited. However, recent allegations of violence involving the popular mascot have left fans shocked and divided.
The allegations began when Chris Greenwell, the father of a 13-year-old boy, claimed that Gritty punched his son in the back during a photo shoot with the mascot at the Wells Fargo Center in November of 2019. According to Greenwell, his son playfully patted Gritty on the head before Gritty responded by lunging at the boy and punching him in the back.
Greenwell said he reported the incident to the Flyers, who allegedly brushed off the incident by offering the family tickets to another game instead of taking their complaint seriously. Greenwell claims his son sought medical attention for back pain as a result of the alleged punch.
In response to the allegations, the Flyers organization released a statement stating that they “investigated Mr. Greenwell’s allegations beginning immediately upon receiving his email nearly two months ago” and determined “there is no evidence of the described actions having  been taken by Gritty.” The team also stated that the alleged victim changed his story several times and declined to cooperate with their investigation.
The accusation has sparked intense debate on social media, with some fans expressing shock and disappointment at the allegations while others outright dismissing the accusation as untrue. Many Flyers fans have come to Gritty’s defense, praising the mascot for his playful and energetic personality and pointing out that the character is not real and therefore incapable of physically hurting anyone.
Despite the conflicting accounts of what really happened during the photo shoot, the incident has put a dent in Gritty’s reputation and raised questions about mascots and their behavior around fans. The Flyers plan to continue to stand by their mascot, but the incident serves as a reminder that even beloved public figures can come under scrutiny and criticism.
