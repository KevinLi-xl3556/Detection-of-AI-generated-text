As the day winds down, here’s a roundup of some of the top news stories that made headlines on Wednesday, covering everything from politics to entertainment.
Impeachment Proceedings Against Former President Trump Continue
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted to create a select committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. The move comes after Senate Republicans blocked an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the events of that day. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named eight members to the committee, including Rep. Liz Cheney, who was recently ousted from her leadership role in the Republican Party for her criticism of former President Trump. The select committee will have subpoena power and will be charged with investigating the circumstances leading up to the attack, as well as the response from law enforcement.
China Trade Tensions Escalate as US Blacklists Companies
The US Commerce Department added five Chinese companies to its trade blacklist on Wednesday, citing concerns about their alleged involvement in human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. The move comes as tensions between the US and China continue to escalate, with the two countries at odds over issues ranging from trade to technology to human rights. The blacklisted companies are accused of playing a role in the forced labor of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has been accused of detaining more than one million Uyghurs in internment camps.
Whitney Houston’s Hologram Tour Begins

The tour has been in the works for several years, but was delayed due to the pandemic.
