Once hailed as one of the most promising midfielders in English football, Danny Drinkwater has fallen from grace in the last few years. His career trajectory is one steeped in both tragedy and self-sabotage, and has led to many questioning just how could a highly talented player hit such rock bottom.
Born in Manchester in 1990, Drinkwater started his footballing career as a youth player for Manchester United, one of the biggest football clubs in the world. Despite his undeniable talent, he struggled to break into the first team and was ultimately loaned out to several lower league teams in order to gain more experience.
After leaving Manchester United permanently in 2012, Drinkwater joined Leicester City, and was instrumental in their shock title win in 2016. Alongside the likes of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, Drinkwater was pivotal to the club’s fairytale success story.
However, since then, his career has taken a drastic turn for the worse. A highly publicised altercation outside a nightclub in 2018 led to Drinkwater being physically assaulted and suffering a serious ankle injury, which left him sidelined for an extended period of time.
It’s no secret that Drinkwater’s career has also been hindered by his own off-field issues. He was caught drink-driving in 2019 and had a highly publicised falling-out with former Aston Villa teammate, Jota, which led to him being sent back to his parent club, Chelsea, with his loan spell cut short.
Now, at 31, Drinkwater’s career hangs in the balance. He has been on loan at Turkish side Kasimpasa, attempting to revive his career, but has only managed one appearance since joining the club on loan in January.
It’s a sad reality for a player once held in such high regard. Many fans and pundits alike have questioned why a player with so much potential has fallen so far, so fast. Some point to his off-field antics, others to a lack of discipline on the pitch.
Whatever the reason, one can’t help but feel that the ballad of Danny Drinkwater is a cautionary tale for future footballing talent. Despite the glamour and the accolades, success in the world of football can be fleeting. One moment you can be a hero, the next you can be a footnote in footballing history.
