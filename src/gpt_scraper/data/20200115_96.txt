OnJanuary 12, 2020, Taal Volcano, situated in the Philippines, erupted and sent ash and smoke up to nine miles in the sky, alarming the world of the potential for more dangerous volcanic activity. Despite the relief that the volcano has eased, many Filipinos are still uneasy about the worst-case scenarios they might face in the future.
Currently, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has lowered the alert status from level four to level three, stating that while the threat level has been reduced, the volcano remains active and that there may still be an eruption in the coming days. Taal Volcano isn’t considered a high-risk volcano, making it more difficult to fully predict the behavior of it.
Since the initial eruption, over 700 volcanic earthquakes have been recorded, and there remains a high probability of explosions from the crater of the volcano. This causes anxiety in the surrounding areas, with over 120,000 people having to flee their homes in the nine-mile danger zone around the volcano. It’s challenging to know precisely what to expect from the volcano, leading officials to prepare and plan in case an eruption does take place.
The volcanic activity isn’t just concerning for the immediate area surrounding the Taal Volcano. Ongoing ashfall has caused significant damage to agriculture and infrastructure throughout the region. Heavy ash-fallings caused houses and buildings to collapse roofs on top of them. The air quality is also a significant worry, and many have gotten sick and rushed to hospitals.
Furthermore, scientists state that there is still a chance of a cataclysmic explosion in Taal’s future, one that could shower nearby areas with ash pours that would affect people’s livelihoods and everyday activities. The impacts of an eruption like this could last for months, with a significant reduction in the country’s economy.
If Taal Volcano’s activity continues at the same level as it has in recent months, with PHIVOLCS looking out for potential increases in volcanic activity, the region could be in a temporary hiatus. Still, authorities and people alike must remain cautious and prepared if the worst should happen.
In conclusion, Taal Volcano’s recent activity draws concerns for the people of the Philippines, hoping an imminent explosion or catastrophe won’t happen. People hope that PHIVOLCS and other governmental units would provide adequate preventative measures to help lessen the potential tragedy’s blow if a massive eruption does occur. Nevertheless, the Philippine nation remains on standby and is ready to respond to any developments that may worry the surrounding areas in Taal Volcano.
