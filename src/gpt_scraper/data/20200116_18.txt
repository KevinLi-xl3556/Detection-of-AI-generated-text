Film Club: ‘Darlin’
Welcome to the latest installment of our film club, where we take a deep dive into some of the newest and most interesting films of the year. This week, we’ll be discussing ‘Darlin’’ a horror/drama directed by Pollyanna McIntosh.
‘Darlin’’ is a movie that will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. The tension and suspense is palpable from the opening scenes until the credits roll. The story revolves around a young feral girl, Darlin (Lauryn Canny), who is found by the police and brought to a Catholic orphanage for girls. However, things aren’t as they seem at the orphanage, and soon Darlin begins to realise the danger lurking around every corner.
The story of Darlin is a sequel to director Pollyanna McIntosh’s previous film, ‘The Woman’ which was released in 2011. ‘The Woman’ was about a family that kidnaps a woman and tries to domesticate her. It was a deeply unsettling film that explored themes of domesticity, patriarchy, and violence. ‘Darlin’ continues this exploration of the dark side of humanity, focusing on how power and control can corrupt even the most holy of institutions.
One of the strengths of the movie is the performances of the actors. Lauryn Canny’s portrayal of Darlin is a standout. She delivers a powerful performance that is both vulnerable and ferocious. The other actors, particularly Cooper Andrews and Nora-Jane Noone, are also excellent in their respective roles. They capture the nuances and complexities of their characters perfectly, making the story more convincing and immersive.
In addition, the cinematography and soundtrack also help to elevate the mood of the film. The dark and foreboding setting of the Orphanage adds to the building tension and creates a sense of unease that stays with the audience long after the credits roll. Similarly, the haunting soundtrack helps to immerse the viewers fully into the story and generate a sense of dread that will keep you on edge throughout.
Overall, ‘Darlin’ is a horror/drama that is not for the faint of heart. It is an intense and uncompromising experience that explores the darkest aspects of humanity. If you are a fan of horror films that refuse to compromise the natures of humanity, then ‘Darlin’ is definitely a must-watch. With its top-notch performances, expert direction, and darkly unsettling tone, it is sure to be an unforgettable film that will stick with you long after you watch it.
