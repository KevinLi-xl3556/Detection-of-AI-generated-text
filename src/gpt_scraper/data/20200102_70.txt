How Did Carlos Ghosn Flee Japan? The Escapade of a Global CEO
On December 29, 2019, the world was stunned by the news that Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman and CEO of Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Alliance, had fled from Japan to Lebanon, where he has citizenship, in a daring escape that involved multiple flights, a private jet, and a musical instrument box. Ghosn, who was facing trial in Japan for financial misconduct charges that he denied, had been under strict surveillance and bail conditions, which made his escape seem improbable. Yet Ghosn, who is known for his resilience and charisma, managed to outwit the Japanese authorities and security measures, and embark on a journey that has raised many questions about his motives, methods, and helpers.
How did Ghosn flee Japan? The answer is a blend of audacity, planning, deception, and luck. According to various reports, including Ghosn’s own statements and his Lebanese lawyer’s accounts, the following timeline and details emerge:


Ghosn had been planning his escape for months, with the help of a Lebanese-American private security expert, Michael Taylor, and his son, Peter, who had experience in extraction missions. The Taylors, who had a company named Global Risk Solutions, allegedly contacted Ghosn through his team and proposed to extract him from Japan to Dubai or Oman, and eventually to Lebanon, by using a private jet and false identities. Ghosn agreed to pay the Taylors several million dollars for their services.


On December 29, 2019, Ghosn left his Tokyo residence, where he was under house arrest, apparently disguised as a musician, with a hat and face mask, and carrying a large box that contained a Yamaha instrument. He took a bullet train to Osaka, where he boarded a private jet, which was chartered by the Taylors and flown from Dubai to Japan by two pilots who were not aware of the true mission. The jet, a Bombardier Global Express, took off from Kansai airport around 11:00 pm, with Ghosn hidden inside the box, which had air holes and was labeled as fragile.


The jet flew over international waters and landed in Istanbul, Turkey, around 5:30 am, where the Taylors and Ghosn spent a few hours in a hotel room, before changing planes and boarding another private jet, which was bound for Beirut, Lebanon. The second jet, a Falcon 900, had been leased by another person and had a different crew, who were also unaware of the real passenger or his situation. The flight to Beirut took about six hours, and Ghosn arrived safely around dawn, where he met his family and made a public statement about his escape and his reasons for it, which he described as a “political persecution” by Japan and its judicial system.


The aftermath of Ghosn’s escape revealed the extent of the deception and vulnerabilities of the Japanese authorities and security measures. The box, which was supposed to be checked as cargo, was not inspected by the airport staff, either due to the fragile label or to the rush of the holiday season. The private jets, which were supposed to be registered and vetted by the Japanese authorities, were not subject to proper scrutiny, and their pilots were not questioned or searched. The hotel room, where the Taylors and Ghosn stayed in Istanbul, was also not tracked or surveilled by the Turkish or Japanese officials, despite their cooperation under an international arrest warrant. The communications between Ghosn and the Taylors, as well as their movements and contacts, were allegedly monitored by the Lebanese intelligence services, who helped Ghosn with his entry and exit procedures.


The legal and diplomatic repercussions of Ghosn’s escape are still unfolding, as Japan seeks to extradite him from Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan, and which regards Ghosn as a victim of injustice and a symbol of Lebanese success and pride. Ghosn, who has denied any wrongdoing and accused his former colleagues and the Japanese authorities of framing him and violating his rights, has vowed to reveal more about his case and fight back against his accusers. The Taylors, who were arrested by US authorities in May 2020 and extradited to Japan in March 2021, are facing charges of aiding and abetting Ghosn’s escape, while Ghosn’s former aides and Nissan executives, who were implicated in his case, are also under investigation and trial in Japan and other countries.


In conclusion, the story of how Carlos Ghosn fled Japan is a fascinating and controversial chapter in the global history of business, law, and politics. It shows the power of money, opportunism, and cross-border networks, as well as the weakness of legal systems, moral principles, and due process. It also raises questions about the legitimacy of the charges and the motives of the accusers, and about the fairness
