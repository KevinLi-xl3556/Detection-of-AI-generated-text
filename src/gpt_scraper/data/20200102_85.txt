The United States Supreme Court has long been a battleground for the most contentious legal issues of our time. One such issue, which has been at the forefront of national debates for decades, has resurfaced once again in recent months: the battle over reproductive rights.
This particular battle has its roots in the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, decided by the Supreme Court in 1973. In that case, the Court held that the Constitution protects a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion. Since then, opponents of abortion have been working tirelessly to overturn or limit that decision, while advocates for reproductive rights have fought to uphold and expand it.
The latest chapter in this ongoing saga began in May 2021, when the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a case called Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The case centers on a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with few exceptions. The law directly challenges the precedent set by Roe v. Wade, which allows states to regulate abortion but prohibits them from banning it outright before fetal viability, which typically occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The Dobbs case represents a significant test of the Court’s commitment to stare decisis, the principle that it should generally adhere to its prior rulings. In recent years, conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents have signaled a willingness to reconsider and possibly overrule Roe v. Wade. With the Court now having a solid conservative majority, many advocates for reproductive rights fear that the Dobbs case could be the first step in rolling back or even overturning that decision.
On the other hand, opponents of abortion see the Dobbs case as an opportunity to finally achieve their longstanding goal of banning abortion across the board. They argue that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion, and that states should have the power to regulate or prohibit it as they see fit. The Mississippi law in question, they say, is a reasonable restriction that balances the interests of the state and the unborn child against the rights of the woman seeking an abortion.
The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the Dobbs case in the fall of 2021, with a decision likely to come in the spring or summer of 2022. In the meantime, both sides of the debate are gearing up for what could be a momentous showdown. Advocates for reproductive rights are mobilizing grassroots campaigns, lobbying lawmakers, and engaging in public education efforts to defend and expand access to abortion. Meanwhile, opponents of abortion are mobilizing their own campaigns, filing legal briefs, and working to build public support for their cause.
Whatever the outcome of the Dobbs case, it is clear that the battle over reproductive rights will continue to be a defining issue in American law and politics for years to come. The stakes are high, with millions of women’s lives and health hanging in the balance. But regardless of which side ultimately prevails, the Dobbs case is a stark reminder of the enduring power of the Supreme Court to shape the course of our nation’s history.
