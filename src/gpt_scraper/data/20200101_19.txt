Fazle Abed, the founder of one of the world’s leading relief agencies, BRAC, passed away at the age of 83 on December 20, 2019. Abed, who was considered a pioneer in the field of development and poverty reduction, had dedicated his life to improving the lives of millions of people in Bangladesh and beyond.
Born in 1936 in Bangladesh, Abed went on to study accounting at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. After working for Shell Oil Company for a brief period, he returned to his home country to help with relief efforts after a devastating cyclone in 1970. This experience led him to realize the immense poverty and lack of opportunity that existed in his country, and he decided to dedicate his life to improving the lives of those around him.
In 1972, Abed founded BRAC (originally the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee), which started as a small relief organization but soon expanded into a multifaceted development agency. BRAC’s mission was to empower the poor, especially women and children, by providing access to education, healthcare, financial services, and other basic needs.
Under Abed’s leadership, BRAC became one of the largest and most effective development organizations in the world. The organization has reached over 120 million people in Bangladesh and beyond, with a focus on empowering women and girls. BRAC’s programs have had a significant impact on poverty reduction, education, healthcare, and gender equality in Bangladesh and other countries where it operates.
In addition to his work with BRAC, Abed also served as a member of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. He was widely recognized for his contributions to development and poverty reduction, receiving numerous awards and honors over the years, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award and the World Food Prize.
Abed’s legacy is a testament to the power of dedication and perseverance in creating meaningful change in the world. He dedicated his life to improving the lives of the poor and marginalized, and his impact will be felt for generations to come. His passing is a great loss for Bangladesh and the world, but his vision and values will continue to inspire and guide those who work towards a more just and equitable world.
