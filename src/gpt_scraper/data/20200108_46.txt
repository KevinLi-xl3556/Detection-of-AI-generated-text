Full Transcript: President Trumpâ€™s Address on Iran
My fellow Americans,
As President of the United States, it is my solemn duty to address you tonight on a matter of great importance. As you all know, Iran has long been a rogue state, funding terror and destabilizing the Middle East.
Last night, Iran launched a series of missile strikes on two U.S. military bases in Iraq. Thankfully, there were no American casualties, but we cannot allow Iran to continue to attack American interests without consequence.
Therefore, I have ordered the United States Armed Forces to launch a targeted strike against high-level Iranian military officials. The purpose of this strike is to deter future Iranian aggression and protect American lives.
Let me be clear: we do not seek war with Iran. We have always stood for peace and will continue to do so. But we will not hesitate to defend ourselves and our allies from any threat.
Iran must immediately cease its support for terrorists and its nuclear program. These actions have only brought misery to the Iranian people and threatened regional stability.
To the Iranian people, I say this: America is not your enemy. We want you to have a bright and prosperous future. But you must reject the radical ideology of the regime that oppresses you and stand with the civilized world.
In conclusion, I ask for your support during this critical time for our nation. We are a strong and resilient people, and we will emerge from this situation even stronger. Let us pray for the safety of our troops and the success of their mission.
Thank you, and God bless America.
