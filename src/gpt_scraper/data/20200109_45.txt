On January 8, 2020, a Ukrainian passenger plane was hit by two missiles and crashed in Iran, killing all 176 people on board. The incident sparked international outrage and calls for a thorough investigation into the cause of the tragedy. Now, a video has emerged that appears to show the moment the plane was hit by the missiles.
The video, which was released by the New York Times on January 14, 2020, shows a missile streaking through the night sky and hitting the plane, causing it to explode in mid-air. The footage was captured by a security camera near the village of Khalaj Abad, just a few kilometers from the Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran.
The video provides new evidence that the Ukrainian passenger plane was indeed hit by a missile, as many had suspected from the beginning. Iranian authorities had initially denied any involvement in the crash, instead suggesting that it was due to a technical malfunction.
However, after several days of mounting evidence and pressure from foreign governments, Iran finally admitted that its military had accidentally shot down the plane. Iranian officials claimed that the plane was mistaken for a hostile target and that the soldiers who fired the missiles had acted without proper authorization.
The admission of responsibility was a significant development in the ongoing investigation into the crash, but it did little to ease the anger and grief of the families of the victims. Many have called for justice and accountability, with some even demanding compensation from Iran for their losses.
The release of the video is likely to increase pressure on Iran to cooperate fully with the investigation and to hold those responsible for the tragedy accountable. It also highlights the crucial role that technology and media can play in uncovering the truth behind major incidents like this.
The Ukrainian plane crash was a tragic reminder of the dangers of conflict and the devastating impact it can have on innocent civilians. The release of this video is a stark reminder of the need for transparency, accountability, and justice in times of crisis.
As the investigation continues, it is important that all parties involved work together to uncover the truth and to ensure that similar tragedies never happen again. The victims and their families deserve nothing less.
