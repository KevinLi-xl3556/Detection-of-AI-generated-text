Trump’s Supporters See U.S. Victory in China Trade Deal
On January 15th, 2020, President Donald Trump and Vice Premier Liu He of China signed a long-awaited trade agreement to ease tensions and improve economic relations between the world’s two largest economies. The deal, called the Phase One trade deal, addressed issues such as intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, agricultural purchases, and currency manipulation, among others. While critics of Trump’s trade policies remain skeptical of the deal’s impact on American workers, many of Trump’s supporters hailed the deal as a major win for the United States.
According to Trump and his top trade advisers, such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the deal achieved several important objectives that previous administrations had failed to address. For instance, China committed to purchasing at least $200 billion worth of U.S. goods and services over the next two years, including agricultural products, energy, manufacturing goods, and services. This would substantially increase the trade volume between the two countries and benefit American farmers and businesses that rely on exporting to China.
Additionally, China agreed to strengthen its protection of intellectual property rights and prohibit the practice of forcing U.S. companies to transfer technology as a condition for doing business in China. This would help level the playing field for U.S. firms in China and prevent them from losing their competitive edge due to stolen ideas and technologies.
Furthermore, the deal required China to be more transparent in its currency practices and avoid manipulating its currency to gain unfair advantages in trade. This would help prevent a currency war between the two powers and promote more stable and predictable exchange rates.
While these provisions were widely welcomed by U.S. trade groups and business leaders, some experts cautioned that the deal was not a comprehensive solution to the deeper structural issues in the U.S.-China economic relationship. They pointed out that the deal did not address the state subsidies to Chinese firms, the absence of a level playing field for U.S. financial services, the human rights abuses in China, or the strategic rivalry between the two countries in technology and security.
Moreover, the deal did not remove the existing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese and American goods, which have already hurt many U.S. farmers and consumers. The deal only provided for a gradual reduction of some tariffs and a dispute-resolution mechanism that could be triggered by either party.
Despite these limitations, Trump’s supporters saw the Phase One trade deal as a significant achievement that fulfilled Trump’s promise to confront China’s unfair trade practices and defend American jobs and industries. They also saw it as a demonstration of Trump’s negotiating skills and his tough stance on China. They believed that the deal sent a strong message to China and the world that the United States would not back down from its economic interests and national security concerns.
In a statement after the signing, Trump said, “Today, we take a momentous step, one that has never been taken before with China, toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade, as we sign Phase One of the historic trade deal between the United States and China. Together, we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers, and families.”
Whether the Phase One trade deal will lead to more positive developments in the U.S.-China relationship, or become a source of new conflicts and tensions, is yet to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the Trump administration and its supporters see it as a victory for the United States in the ongoing economic rivalry with China.
