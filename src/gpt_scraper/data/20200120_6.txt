La Liga Chief Claims Saudi Arabia Is Using Sports to ‘Whitewash’ Reputation
Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, has claimed that Saudi Arabia is using sports to ‘whitewash’ its reputation. This statement came after La Liga signed a multi-year deal with the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) to stage a Spanish Super Cup in the country for the next three seasons, starting from 2020.
The deal has been criticized by human rights groups and Spanish politicians, who say that hosting the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia is a way for the country to gain a positive image despite its human rights records. One of the main issues is the country’s treatment of women, including denying them the right to participate in sports.
Tebas, who has been a vocal advocate for human rights, defended the deal, saying that it would help to promote and develop football in Saudi Arabia. However, he also recognized the concerns surrounding the country’s human rights records and the role of sports in promoting a positive image.
In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Tebas stated, “Saudi Arabia needs to understand that simply using sports to whitewash their reputation won’t work anymore. We need to work together to address civil rights and women’s rights issues, and sports can certainly play a role in this, but it cannot be the only solution.”
Tebas also noted the growing trend of countries using sports events to promote themselves on the global stage, citing the example of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He emphasized that while sports can bring positive attention to a country, it should not be used as a cover for human rights abuses.
The criticism of the deal comes at a time when Saudi Arabia is seeking to improve its image on the global stage, following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and ongoing human rights concerns. The country has been banned from hosting major sporting events in the past, including the WWE’s Crown Jewel event in 2019, due to human rights concerns.
In conclusion, the recent deal between La Liga and the Saudi Arabian Football Federation has raised concerns over the role of sports in promoting positive images of countries with poor human rights records. Javier Tebas has emphasized the need to address civil rights and women’s rights issues, while recognizing the potential for sports to play a positive role in this. It remains to be seen whether the controversy surrounding the deal will have any impact on future plans for sports events in Saudi Arabia or other countries with poor human rights records.
