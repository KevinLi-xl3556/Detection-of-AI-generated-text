In India, pickles are more than just a condiment – they are a cultural institution. And no one knows this better than the ‘Pickle Queen’ herself, Shubha Jain.
Jain, who hails from the city of Indore in central India, has dedicated her life to the art of pickling. Her pickles are renowned across the country for their rich, tangy flavor and impeccable quality. But more than that, they are a testament to India’s rich culinary heritage.
Jain’s journey as a pickle maker began over two decades ago, when she started experimenting with different recipes in her kitchen. She quickly realized that pickling was not just a hobby for her – it was a passion. Over time, she perfected her craft, using only the freshest ingredients and traditional techniques to create pickles that were bursting with flavor.
Today, Jain is a household name in India, known for her pickles that range from the classic mango and lime to more exotic varieties like jackfruit and garlic. But what sets her apart is her commitment to preserving India’s culinary traditions.
Jain sources her ingredients from local farmers and uses only seasonal produce to create her pickles. She also follows age-old techniques that have been passed down through generations of Indian women, ensuring that her pickles are not just delicious but also authentic.
For Jain, pickling is more than just a way to preserve food – it’s a way to preserve the past. She believes that the art of pickling is a crucial part of India’s cultural heritage and that it’s her responsibility to keep it alive. By using traditional techniques and local ingredients, she hopes to pass on her knowledge to future generations and ensure that India’s culinary traditions are not lost to time.
But Jain’s commitment to preserving the past doesn’t stop at pickling. She also runs a museum in Indore that showcases the history of pickling in India. The museum, which she started in 2018, features exhibits on the different types of pickles made across India, as well as the tools and techniques used to make them.
Jain’s work has not gone unnoticed. In 2020, she was awarded the Padma Shri – one of India’s highest civilian awards – for her contribution to the culinary arts. But for Jain, the real reward is seeing the joy her pickles bring to people’s lives.
In a world where fast food and processed snacks dominate, Jain’s pickles are a reminder of a simpler time. They are a testament to the power of tradition and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. And most importantly, they are a delicious reminder of the rich flavors that India has to offer.
