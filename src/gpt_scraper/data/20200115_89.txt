In a stunning turn of events, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced his resignation on Wednesday, January 15th, 2020, amid a flurry of speculation regarding President Vladimir Putin’s future plans. The sudden departure of the premier has left many Russians and international observers puzzled, with some speculating that Putin could be positioning himself for a constitutional shakeup or a larger shift in Russia’s political order.
Medvedev’s resignation came as a surprise to many, as he had been Putin’s closest political ally for years. The announcement - which came during Putin’s State of the Nation Address - also signaled the government’s intention to make major changes to the country’s constitution.
Some experts believe that the surprise move could be an attempt by Putin to consolidate his power, with rumors swirling that he is considering a shift to a new role or a constitutional amendment that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2024, when his current presidential term expires.
Medvedev, in his resignation speech, cited the constitutional changes and their potential impact on the government as his reason for stepping down. “The government should be able to make all the necessary decisions,” he said. “In this context, it is obvious that we, as the government of the Russian Federation, should provide the president of our country with the opportunity to make all decisions that are required for him to carry out his duties.”
The resignation has sparked debate among Russians and international observers alike. Some have welcomed the possibility of new leadership and a different direction for Russia, while others fear that Putin’s grip on power will only grow stronger.
The move comes amid rising tensions between Russia and the West, particularly over Moscow’s role in the conflict in Syria and the annexation of Crimea. Putin’s annexation of Crimea, in particular, has been a sticking point for many Western leaders, who have imposed sanctions on Russia in response.
The timing of Medvedev’s resignation has only added to speculation about Putin’s plans, particularly as the country prepares for parliamentary elections in 2021. Some experts have suggested that Putin may be positioning himself for a new role within the government, such as a key figure in the newly formed State Council, which was created last year to provide additional advisory support to the government.
Others have suggested that Putin may simply be looking to consolidate his power and maintain his grip on the government. The president is known for his love of strong leadership and his willingness to take bold actions to achieve his goals, leading many to question what he has in store for Russia’s political future.
Regardless of what the future holds, Medvedev’s resignation has shaken up the political landscape in Russia and has captured the attention of observers around the world. As Putin’s government moves forward with its plans for constitutional reform, the world will be watching closely to see what comes next.
