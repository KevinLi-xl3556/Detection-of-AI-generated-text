On January 1, 2020, protesters attacked the United States Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, following American airstrikes on an Iran-backed militia. The demonstrations, which lasted for several days, prompted the cancellation of a planned trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ukraine. The events underscored the complex and volatile nature of the political landscape in the Middle East and raised questions about the future of US foreign policy in the region.
The attack on the embassy began when a large crowd of protesters, some of whom were armed, broke through the outer perimeter of the compound and set fire to a guard post. The demonstrators chanted anti-American slogans and demanded that the US withdraw its forces from Iraq. The embassy was placed on lockdown, and US personnel were evacuated to a nearby safe house.
President Donald Trump responded to the attack by threatening to retaliate against Iran, which he accused of orchestrating the demonstrations. Pompeo, who was on a tour of the Middle East at the time, announced that he would cut short his trip to return to Washington, DC to coordinate the US response. The decision also meant that Pompeo would cancel his scheduled trip to Ukraine, where he was expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials to discuss the ongoing conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine.
The cancellation of Pompeo’s trip to Ukraine was a significant blow to the country’s leadership, which had been counting on US support in its efforts to end the conflict with Russia. Zelensky, who had taken office in May 2019 on a platform of anti-corruption and reform, had hoped to use the meeting with Pompeo to bolster his government’s credibility with both the Ukrainian public and the international community. However, the events in Baghdad had taken priority, and Pompeo’s visit to Ukraine would have to wait.
The situation in Iraq and the broader Middle East remained tense in the weeks following the embassy attack. The US continued to carry out airstrikes against Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, while Iran responded with missile strikes on US bases in Iraq. The escalation of hostilities raised fears of a wider conflict between the two countries, and Pompeo’s visit to Ukraine became increasingly uncertain.
In the end, Pompeo did make the trip to Ukraine, but not until January 30, nearly a month after the embassy attack. The delay had given rise to speculation that the US was reconsidering its commitment to Ukraine, but Pompeo sought to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US remained a steadfast ally. He reiterated US support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and pledged to continue providing military and economic aid to the country.
The events of January 2020 highlighted the challenges facing US foreign policy in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The US has long been involved in both regions, but the shifting geopolitical landscape and the rise of new global powers have made it difficult to maintain a consistent approach. Pompeo’s cancellation of his trip to Ukraine underscored the unpredictability of events in the region and the need for the US to be flexible in its response. As tensions continue to simmer in Iraq, Ukraine, and other hotspots around the world, the US will need to remain vigilant and proactive in its efforts to promote peace and stability.
