The assassination of General Qassem Suleimani, one of Iran’s most powerful military figures, has had a significant impact on the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Suleimani’s death has escalated tensions between Iran and the United States, and the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), may be in jeopardy as a result.
The JCPOA was signed in 2015 by Iran and six other countries, including the United States. The deal lifted most of the economic sanctions imposed on Iran in exchange for the country agreeing to limit its nuclear program. However, in 2018, the United States withdrew from the deal under President Donald Trump, citing concerns about Iran’s missile program and its support for terrorism.
Since then, tensions between the United States and Iran have been high. In January 2020, the United States assassinated General Suleimani, which led to retaliatory missile strikes by Iran against US military bases in Iraq. In response, the United States imposed further economic sanctions on Iran.
With the recent change in US leadership and the election of President Joe Biden, there were hopes that the United States would rejoin the JCPOA and lift the sanctions imposed on Iran. However, these hopes have been dashed as a result of Suleimani’s assassination.
Iran has taken a hard line on the JCPOA in the aftermath of Suleimani’s death. In January 2021, Iran announced that it would begin enriching uranium to 20%, which is a significant breach of the terms of the JCPOA. Iran has also demanded that the United States lift all sanctions before it agrees to return to compliance with the JCPOA.
The United States, on the other hand, has insisted that Iran return to full compliance with the JCPOA before any sanctions are lifted. The US has also imposed additional sanctions on Iran in response to the breach of the JCPOA.
The future of the JCPOA is uncertain, and it is unclear whether it will survive in its current form. Many experts believe that the assassination of General Suleimani has made it even more difficult to reach a new agreement on the JCPOA. The hard-line stance taken by both Iran and the United States has made it challenging to find common ground.
The stakes are high for both Iran and the United States. Iran’s economy has been severely impacted by the economic sanctions, and the country has little room for maneuver. The United States, on the other hand, is concerned about Iran’s nuclear program and its support for terrorism.
In conclusion, the assassination of General Suleimani has had a significant impact on the future of the Iran nuclear deal. The JCPOA may be in jeopardy, and it is unclear whether it will survive in its current form. The hard-line stance taken by both Iran and the United States has made it challenging to find common ground, and the stakes are high for both sides. It remains to be seen whether the JCPOA can be salvaged, but it is clear that the road ahead will be a difficult one.
