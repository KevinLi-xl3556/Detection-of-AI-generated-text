Tiny Love Stories: ‘You Feel Good. Is This Good?’
Love can come in many forms, and it isn’t always grand gestures or big romantic gestures. Sometimes, it’s simply the way two people feel when they’re together. This is the essence of a tiny love story. It’s a moment that captures what it feels like to fall in love, even if it’s only for a moment.
One such moment is the question “You feel good. Is this good?” This may seem like a simple question, but it speaks volumes about the complexity of human emotions. The question was asked by a woman to her partner, and it encapsulates the fragility of relationships. It’s the uncertainty of whether the other person feels the same way about you as you do about them.
The woman in the story had been dating her partner for a few months. They had been taking things slow and getting to know each other, but there was a moment when everything changed. They were lying in bed together, and she looked over at him and asked the question, “You feel good. Is this good?”
The man simply smiled and said, “Yes, this is good.” It was a small moment, but it was a turning point in their relationship. It was the realization that they both cared for each other and that they were both invested in making the relationship work.
This tiny love story is a reminder that love doesn’t have to be complicated or grand. It’s the simple moments that matter the most. It’s the feeling of comfort and safety when you’re with the person you love. It’s the realization that you can be your true self around them without fear of judgment.
In a world where love is often portrayed as dramatic and over-the-top, tiny love stories offer a refreshing change. They remind us that love is not about grand gestures or extravagant displays of affection. It’s about the small moments that we share with the people we care about the most.
In conclusion, the question “You feel good. Is this good?” may seem like a small moment, but it’s a powerful reminder of the complexity of human emotions. It’s a tiny love story that captures the essence of falling in love and the uncertainty that comes with it.
