Welcome back to the exciting world of trivia! In our last article, we revealed the winners of the “Word Wizard” contest. Today, we bring you the second part of our series - the “Alphabetrivia” contest. The competition was fierce, with participants from all over the world testing their knowledge of the English alphabet. But after weeks of intense rounds, we finally have our winners!
For those of you who missed our previous article, let’s give you a brief overview of the contest. Alphabetrivia is a game that tests your knowledge of the English alphabet. The game involves answering questions about the alphabet, such as identifying the fifth letter of the alphabet or naming a letter that is not in the word “alphabet.” Contestants were required to answer as many questions as possible within a set time frame, and those who scored the highest advanced to the next round.
Without further ado, let’s meet our top performers:


John Smith - John was the clear winner of the competition, scoring an impressive 95% in the final round. He attributes his success to his love of reading and his passion for puzzles. John plans to donate his prize money to a literacy charity.


Sarah Lee - Sarah came in a close second, with a final score of 90%. She credits her success to her competitive nature and her ability to stay focused under pressure. Sarah plans to use her winnings to travel the world and visit new libraries.


Mark Johnson - Mark is our third-place winner, with a final score of 85%. He says that his success in the competition is due to his love of languages and his ability to spot patterns. Mark plans to invest his prize money in language-learning software.


We also have a special mention for our youngest participant, 10-year-old Emma Brown. Emma did exceptionally well for her age, scoring an impressive 80% in the final round. She says that her love of reading and learning new things helped her in the competition.
The winners of the Alphabetrivia contest not only demonstrated their knowledge of the English alphabet but also their ability to think quickly and stay focused under pressure. They truly embody the spirit of competition and the pursuit of knowledge.
