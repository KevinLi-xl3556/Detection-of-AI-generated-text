Late Night Taken Aback as Trump Says He Likes to Obey the Law
Late night television hosts were left speechless on Monday when former President Donald Trump declared during a Fox News interview that he likes to obey the law. The statement was seen as ironic given his numerous legal battles and controversies during his presidency.
Jimmy Kimmel, host of the late-night talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” joked, “I’m sorry, I don’t speak that language. Can we get a translator?”
Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show,” quipped, “He said he likes to obey the law. That’s like saying he likes to use indoor voices or likes to eat vegetables. It’s not impossible, but it’s not likely.”
Trump’s statement came in response to a question about his relationship with law enforcement. “I have a great relationship with law enforcement. I think they’re incredible people. I also happen to like obeying the law. Believe it or not,” he said.
The comment sparked a flurry of reactions on social media, with many users pointing out the numerous legal controversies that have surrounded Trump during his presidency, including the ongoing investigation into his business practices and his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol insurrection.
Some critics argued that Trump’s statement was a clear attempt to distance himself from his controversial past and present himself as a law-abiding citizen.
However, others suggested that the comment may have been a tongue-in-cheek remark, as Trump is known for his love of sarcasm and trolling.
Regardless of the intent behind his statement, the fact remains that Trump’s presidency was marked by numerous legal battles and controversies. From the ongoing investigations into his business practices to his impeachment trials, Trump was no stranger to legal drama.
Late-night hosts and comedians have long used Trump’s legal troubles as fodder for their jokes and sketches, and it seems that Trump’s latest statement has provided them with yet another opportunity to poke fun at the former president.
In the end, Trump’s statement may have been nothing more than a passing remark. However, it serves as a reminder of the controversial legacy he left behind and the ongoing legal battles that continue to follow him even after leaving office.
As for late-night hosts, they will undoubtedly continue to mine Trump’s statements and actions for comedic gold, regardless of whether he likes to obey the law or not.
