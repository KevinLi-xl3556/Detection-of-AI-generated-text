Taking Stock of the Boeing Crash and Iran Missile Attack
The year 2020 began with tragic news in the aviation industry when a Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 crashed just minutes after takeoff from Tehran’s international airport. All 176 people on board were killed. A few days after the crash, Iran admitted to mistakenly shooting down the airplane, leading to global outrage.
The event quickly led to questions about the safety of air travel in a time where technology has advanced so much. While many countries, especially those in the west, have high safety standards, we cannot overlook issues in other parts of the world where safety might not be a top priority. In addition, the conflict between Iran and the United States further raised questions about the safety of American airlines in the region.
The incident also called into question the Boeing 737 Max, which was involved in two crashes that killed over three hundred people in 2018 and 2019. While Boeing worked to fix the issues with the Max, the crashes were a significant blow to the reputation of one of the world’s leading aircraft manufacturers. After the crashes, airlines around the world grounded their Max fleets, leading to significant losses for both the airlines and Boeing.
In January, Boeing faced increased scrutiny after the release of internal memos revealing employees’ disparaging comments about regulators and the aircraft’s design. With mounting pressure from lawmakers and aviation experts, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg resigned and was replaced by David Calhoun.
Fast forward a few months, and the world found itself in the midst of another crisis when Iran attacked two US military bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of General Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian military commander. The attack included missiles targeted at the bases used by US forces.
Although no US personnel were killed, there were several injuries. The attack led to an increased threat of war between the US and Iran, with some aviation experts fearing that civilians could become accidental casualties should a full-blown war with Iran break out.
In conclusion, the Boeing crash and Iran missile attack have highlighted several issues with the aviation industry and global tensions. It is vital for policymakers to recognize the need for global standards in aviation safety, and aircraft manufacturers must take a more proactive approach to ensure the safety of their products. As for the tensions between the US and Iran, it is critical that policymakers globally work to deescalate the situation to prevent further loss of civilian lives.
