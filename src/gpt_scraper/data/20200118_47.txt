The 2020 race is heating up as the two progressive candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, are becoming frontrunners in the Democratic primary race. Both candidates are advocating for policies such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and progressive taxation. However, this week, there have been some notable developments in their campaigns.
Senator Sanders has gained momentum lately, after winning the popular vote in both Iowa and New Hampshire. He also raised $25 million in January, which is the largest fundraising of any presidential candidate in that month. Sanders is relying on grassroots support and a progressive message to energize voters across the country.
On the other hand, Senator Warren has had some setbacks in her campaign. After placing third in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire, she is trying to re-energize her campaign by unveiling new policy proposals. She released a plan this week targeting the economic challenges of rural communities, which involves investing $85 billion in rural infrastructure and creating new small businesses in towns and farms. She is also focusing on issues such as student debt and housing affordability, to attract younger voters.
The Sanders campaign has been questioning Warren’s authenticity as a progressive, and this week saw their surrogates criticizing her on different television shows. Sanders’s national co-chair, Nina Turner, stated in an interview that Warren is a “capitalist” and that there is no progressive, “unless you’re willing to blow up the system.” Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders, accused Warren of not having a clear message and raised questions about her electability in a general election.
Warren and Sanders had a tense exchange during the Iowa debate over the issue of whether Sanders told Warren that a woman cannot win the presidency, which Sanders denies. Warren refused to shake Sanders’s hand after the debate, which raised concerns among progressives supporters that the two campaigns are engaging in a “toxic” fight.
Both Sanders and Warren have strong progressive platforms, but the question is whether this infighting between the two campaigns will hurt their chances. Polls show that Sanders currently has a slight edge over Warren, but the primary race is far from over. These next few weeks leading up to Super Tuesday will be critical in determining which progressive candidate will have the best chance to win the nomination and go on to defeat President Trump in November.
