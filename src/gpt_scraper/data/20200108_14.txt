PBS’s Sexy ‘Sanditon’ Finishes What Jane Austen Started
Fans of Jane Austen have longed to see her unfinished novel, Sanditon, completed and brought to life onscreen. Now, thanks to PBS’s latest miniseries, that dream has finally been realized. But make no mistake, this is not your grandmother’s Austen adaptation - this is a steamy, sultry version of the classic tale.
Sanditon takes place in the seaside town of the same name, where young Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) finds herself swept up in the drama and intrigue of the wealthy Parker family. While the Parkers and their associates pursue their own romantic and financial ambitions, Charlotte navigates the twists and turns of high society and discovers her own desires.
But what sets Sanditon apart from other Austen adaptations is its unabashed sensuality. Viewers are treated to steamy love triangles, explicit love scenes and even a scandalous nude bathing scene.
Of course, purists may raise objections to these departures from Austen’s original vision. But if we’re being honest, isn’t the idea of a Jane Austen novel infused with raw desire and visceral passion simply irresistible?
At the heart of this new version of Sanditon is the performance of Theo James as Sidney Parker. James brings an undeniable charisma and intensity to the role, making Sidney a complex and captivating figure. Watching him spar with Charlotte is electric, and their chemistry is palpable.
Another highlight of the series is Anne Reid as Lady Denham, the wealthy matriarch at the center of much of the drama in Sanditon. Reid imbues the character with equal parts venom and vulnerability, making Lady Denham a formidable foe for the Parkers and a fascinating figure in her own right.
Of course, no Austen adaptation would be complete without sumptuous costumes and stunning scenery, and Sanditon delivers on both fronts. The seaside town of Sanditon is a character in itself, with its sweeping vistas and picturesque buildings serving as the backdrop for the characters’ romantic and personal struggles.
With Sanditon, PBS has given us an Austen adaptation for the modern age. This is a lush and sexy series that balances true-to-source material with a willingness to push boundaries and explore new territory.
If you’re a Jane Austen fan who thought you’d seen it all, think again - Sanditon is the adaptation you never knew you needed, and it’s sure to leave you breathless.
