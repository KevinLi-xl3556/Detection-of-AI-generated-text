In a world of over 7 billion people, there are approximately 7,117 living languages. Some are spoken by millions, while others by only a handful of people. And then there are those that are on the verge of extinction, spoken by a mere few hundred or even fewer. One such language is called Wèré, and just 700 people speak it worldwide. What’s more surprising is that 50 of those 700 people live in the same Brooklyn building.
Wèré is a language spoken by the Wèré people, an indigenous community of Benin in West Africa. Like many other indigenous languages, Wèré is at risk of disappearing due to a lack of government support, the dominance of the French language, and the influence of global cultures.
The Wèré people have a long history of migration and resettlement, with many of them moving to countries such as Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. However, in recent years, many have also made their way to the United States, particularly to New York City.
The 50 Wèré speakers in the Brooklyn building all live on the same floor, and they often gather together to speak their native language and connect with their cultural roots. For them, speaking Wèré is not just a means of communication but also a way of preserving their identity and heritage.
Unfortunately, the Wèré language is not recognized by the United States government, which means that there is no official support for its preservation and promotion. As a result, many Wèré children in the United States grow up speaking only English and losing touch with their cultural heritage.
However, there are some efforts underway to document and revitalize the Wèré language. In 2019, a group of linguists from the University of Delaware traveled to Benin to work with the Wèré community and develop materials for language instruction. Their efforts have resulted in the creation of a Wèré language dictionary, a grammar book, and audio recordings of Wèré speakers.
The Wèré people themselves are also taking steps to preserve their language. In New York City, a Wèré community center was established in 2016, where Wèré language classes are held and cultural events are organized. The community center also provides a space for Wèré people to come together and support each other in their shared experiences of migration and adaptation to life in a new country.
The story of the Wèré language and the 50 speakers in the Brooklyn building highlights the importance of language preservation and cultural diversity. It is a reminder that every language is unique and valuable, and that the loss of a language is a loss of a way of life, a way of thinking, and a way of understanding the world.
As the world becomes more interconnected and globalized, it is crucial that we continue to support and promote linguistic and cultural diversity. Whether it is through government policies, community initiatives, or individual efforts, we must recognize the value of every language and work to preserve them for future generations.
