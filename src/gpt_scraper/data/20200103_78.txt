Qassim Suleimani, Master of Iran’s Intrigue, Built a Shiite Axis of Power in Mideast
Qassim Suleimani, the late commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, was a strategic mastermind who wielded immense power and influence in the Middle East. Known for his covert operations, Suleimani played a key role in building a Shiite axis of power across the region, furthering Iran’s ambitions and challenging its rivals.
Suleimani rose to prominence within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and became the architect of Iran’s regional strategy. He was known for his charismatic leadership, tactical brilliance, and unwavering loyalty to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Suleimani’s influence extended far beyond Iran’s borders, as he orchestrated and executed Iran’s covert operations in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.
One of Suleimani’s most significant achievements was the creation of a Shiite axis of power in the Middle East. He sought to establish Iran as the dominant power in the region by aligning with and empowering Shiite militant groups and governments that shared Iran’s revolutionary ideology. Suleimani effectively built a network of proxies and allies that extended Iran’s reach and influence in the region.
In Iraq, Suleimani played a crucial role in supporting Shiite militias that fought against the U.S. forces during the Iraq War. He provided military training, weapons, and financial support to these militias, which later became powerful political entities within Iraq’s government. Suleimani’s efforts helped to shape Iraq’s political landscape in favor of Iran, leading to a government that was more aligned with Tehran’s interests.
In Syria, Suleimani was instrumental in supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war. He provided military advice, intelligence, and crucial military support to the Syrian government, including deploying Iranian-backed Shiite militias to fight alongside Assad’s forces. Suleimani’s intervention in Syria helped to rescue the Assad regime from the brink of collapse and ensured that Iran maintained its foothold in the country.
In Lebanon, Suleimani supported Hezbollah, a Shiite militant group that has close ties to Iran. He provided Hezbollah with financial support, military training, and weapons, which enabled the group to become a powerful force in Lebanese politics and maintain a strong military presence in the region. Suleimani’s support for Hezbollah furthered Iran’s goal of challenging Israel’s regional dominance and establishing a front against the Jewish state.
In Yemen, Suleimani backed the Houthi rebels, a Shiite militant group that fought against the internationally recognized government supported by a Saudi-led coalition. He provided the Houthis with weapons, financial support, and military advice, which enabled them to challenge the Yemeni government and expand their territorial control. Suleimani’s support for the Houthis further complicated the conflict in Yemen and intensified regional tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Suleimani’s strategic maneuvering and covert operations in the Middle East earned him a reputation as a master of Iran’s intrigue. He was widely regarded as a hero in Iran and revered by many Shiite militants and proxies across the region. However, he was also a controversial figure, with many accusing him of fueling sectarian conflicts, sponsoring terrorism, and destabilizing the region.
Suleimani’s influence and power came to an abrupt end in January 2020 when he was killed in a targeted U.S. drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq. His death was a significant blow to Iran’s regional ambitions and left a void in Iran’s covert operations and strategic planning. However, Iran has vowed to continue Suleimani’s legacy and maintain its Shiite axis of power in the Middle East.
