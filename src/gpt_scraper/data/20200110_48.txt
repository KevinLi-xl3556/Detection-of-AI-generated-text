On Thursday, January 2nd, 2020, Ireland lost one of its most influential voices in radio, Marian Finucane. She was 69 years old.
Marian was a trailblazer in Irish media, working for Radio Telefis Eireann (RTÉ) for over 40 years. She was a master of her craft, known for her insightful interviews and discussions on topics ranging from politics to arts and culture. Marian also hosted a popular weekend radio show where she engaged with listeners and explored the issues that mattered most to the Irish people.
Throughout her career, Marian won numerous awards for her journalistic work, including the Irish Tatler Woman of the Year Award and the PPI National Radio Award for News Broadcaster of the Year. She was a respected member of the media industry, admired by her colleagues and loved by her audience.
Marian’s passing came as a shock to many. Tributes poured in from across the country and beyond, with colleagues and politicians alike expressing their sadness at the loss of such a cherished figure. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said, “Marian was a broadcaster of immense capability, decency and professionalism. Her work on radio will stand the test of time.”
Marian’s impact on Irish media cannot be overstated. She gave a voice to those who were often unheard, challenged the status quo, and created a space for important conversations to take place. Her dedication to journalism and her love for her country and its people will be sorely missed.
As we mourn the loss of Marian Finucane, we can take comfort in the legacy she leaves behind. Her contributions to Irish media will continue to inspire and inform future generations of journalists and broadcasters for years to come. Rest in peace, Marian.
