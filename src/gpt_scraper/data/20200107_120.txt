A Year After a #MeToo Reckoning, Economists Still Grapple With It
It has been more than a year since the wave of #MeToo revelations began, with countless stories about sexual harassment and assault surfacing across industries, including the field of economics. Sexual misconduct can be found in almost every sector of the economy, from Hollywood to Silicon Valley, and this movement has brought to the forefront some uncomfortable truths about the economics profession that must be addressed.
The #MeToo movement has prompted many women in the economics profession to come forward with their own stories of harassment and abuse. The response from the profession has varied, with some economists taking the issue seriously and striving to implement meaningful changes, while others dismiss the problem as a distraction from the “real” work of economics.
While the economics profession is often viewed as a meritocracy, with objective analysis guiding decision-making, the #MeToo movement has revealed that gender inequality may play a role in who is heard and who is ignored. A 2013 survey conducted by the American Economic Association found that women in economics report more harassment and discrimination than their male counterparts, with women of color reporting the highest rates of harassment.
The issue of sexual harassment goes beyond simple workplace dynamics, however. Research by economists Cecilia Rouse and Heather Sarsons has shown that sexual harassment can have a chilling effect on women’s careers, leading to reduced productivity and a decrease in the number of women who pursue economics as a profession. This, in turn, can have profound economic consequences, as a more diverse set of voices and experiences can lead to better policy outcomes.
In response to the #MeToo movement, many economics departments have begun to implement changes aimed at creating a more inclusive and respectful workplace. The American Economics Association has also taken steps to address the issue, including creating a code of conduct and a committee to investigate and address complaints of harassment.
However, there is still a long way to go. Many critics argue that current measures are not enough to address the deep-seated problem of sexual harassment in the economics profession. Some argue that institutions must take a more proactive approach to creating a culture of respect and inclusivity, including implementing programs to encourage diversity and inclusion, and addressing the power dynamics that allow harassment to continue unchecked.
Ultimately, the #MeToo movement has opened up a critical conversation about the role of gender inequality in the economics profession. As economists continue to grapple with this issue, it is important to remember that the pursuit of objectivity and rigor in research cannot come at the expense of basic human decency and respect. By creating a culture that values diversity, inclusivity, and respect, the economics profession can better serve its mission of promoting prosperity for all.
