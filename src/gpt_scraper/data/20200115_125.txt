In recent years, there has been a collective push towards gender equality across the globe. It has been a long and arduous journey, beginning with the suffragette movement in the early 20th century, which led to women being granted the right to vote. Since then, women have fought tirelessly for equal rights in various walks of life, be it education, employment, or social empowerment. And finally, after years of hard work, it seems that women may finally be declared equal in every sense of the word.
The rise of feminism and the #MeToo movement has shone a much-needed light on the injustices faced by women in various industries, particularly those in male-dominated fields such as entertainment and politics. The movement has led to a wave of women coming forward with stories of harassment, assault and discrimination at the hands of men in positions of power. This has brought about significant changes in many industries and workplaces. Companies have begun implementing policies to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace, such as training sessions and anonymous reporting systems. Governments have launched investigations and passed laws to protect women’s rights, such as tougher sentences for sex offenders.
In addition to the #MeToo movement, the United Nations has been actively working towards achieving gender equality through its Sustainable Development Goals. The fifth goal of the SDGs is to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. This involves empowering women economically, ensuring access to education and healthcare, and promoting equal representation in leadership positions.
Another significant development in achieving gender equality is the representation of women in politics. In recent years, we have seen more women enter the political arena and rise to positions of power. For example, in 2021 Kamala Harris became the first female Vice President of the United States. Women leaders such as Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel, and Tsai Ing-wen have shown that women can lead nations as competently as men. This has paved the way for more women to enter politics and pursue leadership positions.
While there have been significant strides towards gender equality, there is still much work to be done. Women are still underrepresented in many industries and positions of power. They continue to face discrimination and harassment, and the gender pay gap remains a significant issue. The fight for women’s rights cannot stop until every woman is afforded the same opportunities as men.
In conclusion, women have come a long way in the fight for gender equality.  The #MeToo movement, sustainable development goals, political representation, and equal treatment in various fields are some of the aspects that will collectively lead to the elimination of gender biases. Although we still face challenges, together we can work towards building a more just and equal world for all. Hopefully, one day soon, we may see the day when women are finally declared as equal.
