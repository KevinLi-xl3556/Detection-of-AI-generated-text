In October 2018, a Lion Air 737 Max crashed in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. Just five months later, another 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia, claiming the lives of all 157 passengers and crew. These two tragedies spelled the end of the 737 Max, and the catastrophe ultimately cost Boeing over $18 billion.
Amid the chaos and heartbreak, a disturbing pattern emerged: Boeing’s responsibility in the Lion Air crash seemed to have been “buried.” This phrase was used by the parents of a young man who died in the crash, who spoke to CBS News about their frustration over what they perceived as a lack of transparency from Boeing.
The Lion Air crash was caused by a faulty sensor, which fed incorrect data to the plane’s anti-stall system. This system then forced the plane’s nose downward, despite the pilots’ attempts to correct it. After the crash, it emerged that Boeing had known about the potential dangers of the anti-stall system, but had failed to adequately warn pilots or update their training.
As the investigations into the crash unfolded, it became clear that the FAA had delegated a large degree of authority to Boeing in the certification process for the 737 Max. The company was responsible for self-certifying many aspects of the plane’s safety, including the software that controlled the anti-stall system. This lack of oversight has been widely criticized as a major contributing factor to the crashes.
Boeing’s response to the tragedies only added fuel to the fire. The company’s CEO initially downplayed the role of the anti-stall system in the Lion Air crash, prompting outrage from victims’ families and the wider public. It later emerged that Boeing had lobbied to avoid costly simulator training for pilots, even as evidence mounted that such training could have prevented the crashes.
As the investigations into the crashes continue, questions are being asked about whether Boeing is truly taking responsibility for its role in the tragedies. The company has paid out billions of dollars to victims’ families and has been hit with numerous lawsuits and fines, but critics argue that this is not enough.
Ultimately, the lessons of the 737 Max saga go beyond aviation safety. They speak to the fundamental importance of corporate responsibility and transparency. When companies prioritize profit over safety, the consequences can be devastating. The families of those who died in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes have learned this lesson the hard way – and it is up to all of us to ensure that such tragedies are never allowed to happen again.
