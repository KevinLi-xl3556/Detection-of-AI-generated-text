Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan Motor Co., has been making headlines since his first arrest in November 2018. He has since fled bail and is now a fugitive from Japanese law, claiming he is afraid of the Japanese justice system. So why did Ghosn become so afraid, and what led to his current predicament?
To understand the situation, we first have to go back in time to when Ghosn was first appointed as the CEO of Nissan in 1999. At the time, Nissan was struggling financially, and Ghosn was tasked with turning the company around. He did so successfully, becoming known as a hero in Japan.
However, his reputation began to tarnish when allegations of financial misconduct surfaced in 2018. Ghosn was accused of underreporting his income and using company funds for personal gain, among other things. This led to his arrest in November 2018, and he was subsequently fired from his position at Nissan.
The Japanese justice system is known for being very strict and, in some cases, even harsh. Ghosn was subjected to long periods of detention before being charged, during which he claims he was subjected to inhumane treatment, including being interrogated for hours without a break.
Ghosn claims that the charges against him were the result of a conspiracy, with Nissan executives working with Japanese prosecutors to bring him down. He also claims that he was denied due process and that the Japanese justice system is biased against him.
After being released on bail in April 2019, Ghosn fled to Lebanon in December of the same year. He claims that he had to escape because he believed he would not receive a fair trial in Japan and that he was at risk of being subjected to further mistreatment.
Regardless of whether or not Ghosn is guilty of the charges against him, it is clear that his experience with the Japanese justice system has left him feeling deeply traumatized. The long periods of detention and rigorous interrogations he faced have been described by some as a form of psychological torture.
In conclusion, Carlos Ghosnâ€™s fear of the Japanese justice system is not unfounded. The strict nature of the system and the harsh treatment he received while in custody have left him feeling deeply traumatized. Whether or not he will ever return to Japan to face trial is unclear, but one thing is certain: his experience will have a lasting impact on how he views the Japanese legal system.
