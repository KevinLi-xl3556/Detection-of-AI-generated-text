If Women Ruled the World, What Would They Wear?
Possible article:
As the world celebrates International Women’s Day and women’s achievements, it’s worth imagining a world where women held more power and influence in politics, economy, and culture. In such a world, one may wonder, what would women wear if they ruled the world?
Historically, women’s clothing has been shaped by many factors, including social norms, economic conditions, climate, and technology. Men have often dominated the fields of politics, business, and war, and women have adapted their attire to signal their subordinate status, compliance, or rebellion. However, women have also used clothing to express their creativity, identity, and solidarity, as well as to challenge and transform gender stereotypes and expectations.
If women ruled the world, it’s possible that the fashion industry would be different than it is today, which is largely run by men who often perpetuate harmful ideals of beauty, body image, and consumption. Women may prioritize sustainability, diversity, and comfort over profit, homogeneity, and discomfort. They may also value a wider range of styles, fabrics, and colors that reflect their individuality and cultural heritage.
One possible scenario is that women may abandon traditional gender roles and dress codes that require women to wear skirts, dresses, high heels, and makeup, while men can wear pants, shirts, and shoes without much variation. Women may create more gender-neutral or fluid styles that allow everyone to express themselves beyond binary categories. They may also encourage more collaboration and communication across diverse groups, including ethnic, racial, and class differences.
Another possible scenario is that women may embrace their femininity and expand its meanings beyond the narrow confines of patriarchal ideals. Women may celebrate their bodies in all their shapes, sizes, and abilities, and reject the pressure to conform to a narrow standard of beauty that often excludes or harms women of color, disabled women, and queer women. Women may also reclaim and reinterpret traditional practices and garments from their own cultures and histories, and show pride in their roots and resilience.
Whatever the future of fashion may bring, it’s clear that women’s voices and visions should be central to its direction and development. Women have always been creative and resourceful in making and wearing clothes, and they deserve to have more say in what they wear and why. If women ruled the world, they would wear what they want, when they want, and how they want, without fear or shame. And that, perhaps, is the ultimate expression of freedom and dignity that all humans deserve.
