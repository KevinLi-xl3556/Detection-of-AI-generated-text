China has been accused of obtaining American trade secrets through various means including hacking, theft, and bribery. These accusations have been a source of tension in the trade relationship between the two countries. While China denies any wrongdoing, evidence suggests that they have been actively seeking to acquire American trade secrets for years.
One method China uses to obtain American trade secrets is through economic espionage. Chinese state-sponsored hackers have been known to hack into American companies’ computer systems to steal sensitive information. In 2015, five Chinese military officers were indicted by the US Department of Justice for hacking into American companies’ networks and stealing trade secrets. The Chinese government denies any involvement in these actions.
Another way China obtains American trade secrets is through theft. Chinese nationals living in the US have been caught stealing trade secrets from American companies and sending the information back to China. In 2019, a Chinese national was arrested for stealing trade secrets from General Electric’s turbine technology division in New York. The individual was caught trying to smuggle the stolen information out of the country.
China has also been accused of obtaining American trade secrets through bribery. The Chinese government has been known to pay employees of American companies to provide them with sensitive information. This was the case with Broadcom, a California-based technology company. In 2020, a former Broadcom employee was charged with accepting bribes from the Chinese government in exchange for providing them with trade secrets.
The US government has taken steps to counter Chinese efforts to obtain American trade secrets. In 2018, the US passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) to strengthen the government’s ability to review foreign investments in US companies. The US also passed the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) in 2018, which aims to prevent the transfer of sensitive US technology to foreign countries, including China.
In conclusion, China has been accused of obtaining American trade secrets through various means including hacking, theft, and bribery. While the Chinese government denies any wrongdoing, evidence suggests that they have been actively seeking to acquire American trade secrets for years. The US government has taken steps to counter these efforts, but the tension between the two countries over trade secrets is likely to continue.
