Milan Men’s Week, the bi-annual event dedicated to men’s fashion, has come and gone once again, leaving a trail of impressive designs and innovative style in its wake. However, amid the glitz and glamour of the runway, there was an undercurrent of something much darker: the ongoing war between traditional masculinity and modern masculinity.
At the heart of this struggle are the designers themselves. Some cling to the traditional ideal of masculinity - one that emphasizes strength, power, and ruggedness - while others are pushing for a new definition of what it means to be a man in the 21st century - one that rejects toxic stereotypes and embraces vulnerability, empathy, and inclusivity.
This tension was on full display during Milan Men’s Week. Some designers presented collections that seemed to glorify toxic masculinity, with models sporting hyper-masculine, militaristic looks that emphasized aggression and dominance. Others, meanwhile, presented collections that eschewed these themes altogether, instead showcasing softer, more fluid designs that defied traditional gender norms.
For instance, British designer Craig Green’s collection featured flowing, draped garments that blurred the lines between masculine and feminine, while Dutch designer Sander Lak opted for pastel colors, floral prints, and delicate cuts that would traditionally be viewed as feminine.
At the same time, designers like Philipp Plein and Marcelo Burlon showcased highly muscular, military-inspired looks, complete with bulletproof vests and sleek combat boots. Though visually stunning, these designs seemed to harken back to a bygone era of masculinity, one that emphasizes aggression, domination, and physical power over emotional intelligence and self-reflection.
This tension between traditional and modern masculinity has been brewing for years, but it shows no signs of abating. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, many designers are rethinking their approach to masculinity, while others continue to cling to outdated notions of strength and dominance.
The irony, of course, is that many of the qualities associated with modern masculinity - empathy, vulnerability, and inclusivity - are themselves highly masculine. Yet, in a culture that has long stigmatized these traits as “weak” or “unmanly,” it can be difficult for designers to take the risk of embracing them fully.
As Milan Men’s Week comes to a close, one thing is clear: the war between traditional and modern masculinity is far from over. While some designers are leading the charge for a more inclusive and empowering vision of masculinity, others are clinging to outdated ideals that perpetuate toxic gender norms. Which side will ultimately prevail? Only time will tell.
