Jack Garfein, a director known for his work during the heyday of the Actors Studio, passed away at the age of 89. Garfein was a key figure in the development of the Method style of acting, which emphasized emotional authenticity and intense character study.
Born in Mukachevo, Czechoslovakia, in 1930, Garfein survived the Holocaust and came to the United States as a refugee in 1947. He began his career as an actor, studying under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York City. Garfein quickly became interested in directing, and he honed his craft at the Studio and with the Group Theatre.
Garfein’s breakthrough came in 1956, when he directed the off-Broadway play “End as a Man,” which was written by his friend and fellow Studio member Calder Willingham. The play, which explored the brutal hazing rituals of a military academy, was a critical success and marked Garfein as a director to watch.
Garfein went on to direct several more plays and two feature films, “The Strange One” (1957) and “Something Wild” (1961). Both films dealt with dark and taboo subjects, including homosexuality and rape, and were praised for their uncompromising approach to difficult material.
Garfein’s work was always deeply personal and informed by his own experiences. His 1960 memoir, “Before the Limit,” chronicled his time in the concentration camps and his struggle to rebuild his life in America. Garfein was also a vocal advocate for survivors of trauma and abuse, and he worked with numerous organizations to raise awareness about these issues.
Garfein’s legacy is evident in the enduring influence of the Actors Studio and the Method style of acting. His uncompromising approach to storytelling and his commitment to emotional authenticity continue to inspire generations of artists.
In a statement, the Actors Studio praised Garfein as “a master storyteller and an uncompromising artist” who “changed the course of American theater and film.” Garfein will be deeply missed by his friends, colleagues, and the countless artists he inspired.
