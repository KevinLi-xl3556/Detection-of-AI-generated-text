On Thursday, the federal appeals court in Manhattan overturned the extortion and money-laundering convictions of former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. The ruling allows Silver to be retried for honest services fraud but effectively ends his seven-year-old prosecution on the other charges.
Silver was the enormously powerful Democratic leader of the state Assembly for over 20 years until he was arrested in January 2015. The charges against him stemmed from two schemes he carried out to obtain nearly $4 million in kickbacks and bribes.
In the first scheme, Silver received referral fees for steering real estate developers to a law firm that specialized in property tax appeals. In the second, he directed $500,000 in state funds to a cancer researcher who in turn gave kickbacks to Silver by referring asbestos cases to a law firm that paid him.
Silver was convicted of extortion and money laundering in 2015 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. But in 2018, the Supreme Court, in a major corruption case involving Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, narrowed the definition of bribery under federal law.
On Thursday, the appeals court said that the jury instructions in Silver’s case did not reflect the new definition of bribery and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of extortion for the real estate scheme. The court also said that one of the money-laundering counts against Silver was tied to the overturned extortion count and must also be vacated.
However, the court upheld other money-laundering counts, as well as a charge of honest services fraud, which involves using one’s position for personal gain. The court said that the evidence was sufficient to prove that Silver engaged in a quid pro quo with the cancer researcher and that he concealed the kickbacks he received.
The appeals court’s ruling means that Silver, who is now 76, will likely face a new trial on the honest services fraud charge. But it also marks a significant victory for Silver’s defense team, which argued that his conviction should be overturned in its entirety due to the Supreme Court’s McDonnell decision.
In a statement, Silver’s lawyer, Joel Cohen, said, “We are gratified that the court saw the merits of our appeal and reversed the conviction as to count one. We look forward to a new trial in the near future.”
