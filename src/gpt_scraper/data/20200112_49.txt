LVMH Watch Executives on 2020 and Beyond
The luxury watch industry, like many others, faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the global pandemic. But as the world slowly returns to some sense of normalcy, executives at LVMH’s watch brands are optimistic about the future and are focused on innovation and sustainability to drive growth.
In a recent interview, Stephane Bianchi, the CEO of LVMH’s Watchmaking Division, which includes brands like TAG Heuer, Hublot, and Zenith, discussed the impact of the pandemic on the luxury watch industry and the strategies his brands are using to adapt.
Bianchi acknowledged that 2020 was a difficult year for the industry, with sales declining significantly in the first half of the year due to store closures and reduced consumer spending. However, he noted that sales rebounded strongly in the second half of the year, and that the brands were able to maintain their profitability thanks to their quick response to the crisis and their ability to adapt to changing market conditions.
Looking ahead, Bianchi said that innovation would be a key driver of growth for LVMH’s watch brands. He pointed to recent product launches like TAG Heuer’s Connected watch, which combines luxury design with cutting-edge technology, and Zenith’s DEFY 21 Ultraviolet, which features a new type of material that creates a glowing effect on the watch face. These products, Bianchi said, demonstrate the brands’ commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the luxury watch industry.
Bianchi also emphasized the importance of sustainability to LVMH’s watch brands, noting that consumers are increasingly looking for products that are both luxurious and environmentally responsible. He highlighted the use of recycled materials in some of the brands’ watches, as well as their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint through initiatives like Hublot’s “MP-11 Magic Gold” project, which uses a special gold alloy that is significantly less energy-intensive to produce than traditional gold.
Overall, Bianchi and the other executives at LVMH’s watch brands are optimistic about the future of the luxury watch industry. While challenges remain, they believe that a focus on innovation and sustainability will help their brands thrive in the years to come. As Bianchi put it, “The luxury watch industry is constantly evolving, and we’re excited to be at the forefront of that evolution.”
