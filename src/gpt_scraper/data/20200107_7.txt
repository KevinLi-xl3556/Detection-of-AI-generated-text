In early January 2020, a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, Iraq. The move immediately sparked controversy, with many questioning the legality and strategic value of the operation. But as the dust settled, one word began to dominate the discourse around the strike: assassination.
The accusation of assassination is not a new one when it comes to U.S. foreign policy. In fact, the term has been used to describe a number of high-profile targeted killings, including those of Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki. But the Soleimani strike was different in a number of ways.
For one, Soleimani was not a terrorist leader or a member of a militant group. He was a high-ranking military official in a sovereign nation, and his killing was widely seen as an act of war. Additionally, the strike was carried out without the authorization of Congress, which further fueled concerns about the legality of the operation.
But perhaps most significantly, the accusation of assassination was fueled by the language used by President Trump and his administration to justify the strike. In a tweet following the operation, Trump declared that Soleimani had been “terminated” and that he “should have been taken out many years ago.”
These words, along with others used by administration officials, suggested that the strike was not a necessary military operation, but rather a targeted killing carried out for political reasons. This interpretation was further supported by reports that the strike was planned months in advance and that the administration had considered using it as a distraction from impeachment proceedings.
Of course, not everyone agreed with the accusation of assassination. Some argued that Soleimani was a legitimate target due to his role in coordinating attacks against U.S. personnel and interests in the region. Others pointed out that the U.S. has a long history of targeted killings, and that the use of drone strikes in particular has become a key component of U.S. counterterrorism efforts.
But regardless of one’s stance on the issue, the accusation of assassination highlighted a broader concern about the use of military force in the modern era. As technology has advanced and the world has become more interconnected, the lines between war and peace have become increasingly blurred. This has led to a situation where targeted killings can be carried out with relative ease, often without the need for congressional approval or even a formal declaration of war.
The Soleimani strike was just one example of this trend, but it served as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked executive power. As the U.S. continues to grapple with complex global challenges, it is essential that we carefully consider the consequences of our actions and remain vigilant against abuses of power. Only by doing so can we ensure that our military interventions are truly just and in the best interest of our nation and the world as a whole.
