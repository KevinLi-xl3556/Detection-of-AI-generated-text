Judge John Hodgman on Eating Pizza With a Knife and Fork
Pizza is one of the world’s most beloved foods. Whether you prefer it with pepperoni or mushrooms, thin crust or deep dish, there’s no denying the deliciousness of a hot, cheesy slice of pizza. However, there is one controversial issue that has divided pizza lovers for years: should you eat pizza with your hands or with a knife and fork? To settle this debate, we turn to Judge John Hodgman for his expert opinion.
Judge Hodgman is a writer, comedian, and podcaster who is known for his ability to solve all kinds of disputes, from the trivial to the profound. When it comes to pizza, he has some strong opinions on the proper way to eat it.
According to Judge Hodgman, there is no one “right” way to eat pizza. “Pizza is a versatile food that can be enjoyed in many different ways,” he says. “Some people like to fold their slices and eat them with their hands, while others prefer to use a knife and fork. It all comes down to personal preference.”
However, Judge Hodgman does have some guidelines for those who choose to eat pizza with a knife and fork. “First and foremost, you should use a sharp knife that is capable of cutting through the crust without tearing it,” he advises. “You don’t want to end up with a mess of cheese and sauce on your plate because your knife wasn’t up to the task.”
In addition, Judge Hodgman recommends using a fork to lift the pizza slice onto your plate or into your mouth, rather than using the knife to do so. “Using a knife to lift the slice can result in the toppings sliding off or the crust breaking apart,” he warns. “A fork provides a more stable and precise grip.”
Of course, there are some situations where eating pizza with a knife and fork is simply impractical, such as at a casual pizza party or while walking down the street. In these cases, Judge Hodgman advises using your best judgment. “If you’re in a situation where eating pizza with your hands is more appropriate, then go for it,” he says. “Just be sure to wash your hands first!”
Ultimately, the decision to eat pizza with a knife and fork comes down to personal preference and the situation at hand. Whether you prefer to use your hands or a utensil, the most important thing is to enjoy the deliciousness of this beloved food in whatever way makes you happiest.
In conclusion, Judge John Hodgman believes that there is no one right way to eat pizza, and that the decision to use a knife and fork should be based on personal preference and the situation. However, if you do choose to use a utensil, be sure to use a sharp knife and a fork for a more stable grip. And remember, whether you’re eating pizza with your hands or with a knife and fork, the most important thing is to savor every bite of this delicious food.
