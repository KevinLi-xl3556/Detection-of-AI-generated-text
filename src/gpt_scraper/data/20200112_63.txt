Corrections: Jan. 12, 2020
As a news publication committed to accuracy, we take our responsibility to correct errors seriously. In the interest of transparency and accountability, we are publishing a list of corrections for our Jan. 12, 2020 edition.


In an article titled “Local School Wins National Award,” we incorrectly stated that the school had received the award for the first time. In fact, the school had won the award twice before, in 2015 and 2017.


In a business feature titled “Entrepreneurial Spirit Drives Small Business Growth,” we misidentified the CEO of a local startup. The correct name is John Smith, not Jane Smith.


In a sports report titled “Team Celebrates Historic Victory,” we mistakenly referred to the team’s star player as a freshman. In fact, she is a sophomore.


In a letter to the editor titled “In Defense of the Second Amendment,” we misquoted a founding father. The correct quote is “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed,” not “The right to bear arms shall not be infringed.”


We apologize for these errors and any confusion or inconvenience they may have caused. We remain committed to upholding the highest standards of journalism and will continue to strive for accuracy and fairness in all our reporting.
