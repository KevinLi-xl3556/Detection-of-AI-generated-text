When it comes to getting an X-ray, we’re all familiar with the image of a technician handing us a heavy lead apron to wear to protect us from radiation. But recent studies are suggesting that we may not actually need these aprons after all.
The belief that lead aprons are necessary stems from the idea that radiation exposure can increase the risk of cancer. While this is true, the amount of radiation that we’re exposed to during an X-ray is actually quite low. In fact, the amount of radiation that we receive during a dental X-ray is roughly equivalent to the amount that we receive during a flight from New York to Los Angeles.
Even more importantly, wearing a lead apron may actually be doing more harm than good. The weight of the apron alone can lead to physical strain and discomfort during the procedure, which can negatively impact the quality of the X-ray image. Additionally, if the apron isn’t positioned properly, it can actually block the radiation from reaching the part of the body that needs to be imaged, which can require the patient to undergo a repeat procedure.
So, if these aprons aren’t necessary, why are they still used so frequently? Many doctors and technicians have simply continued to use them out of habit, without realizing that they may not be providing the level of protection that we once thought they were. In fact, in 2017, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine conducted a study and found that the use of lead aprons during X-rays should be reassessed.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that we should throw all caution to the wind when it comes to radiation exposure. Doctors and technicians should still take measures to ensure that patients are exposed to the lowest amount of radiation possible, such as using digital imaging techniques and adjusting the duration and intensity of the X-ray according to the patient’s body size and type.
In summary, while we’ve long believed that lead aprons are necessary for protecting ourselves during X-rays, recent studies are suggesting that this may not be the case. Not only can they impact the quality of the X-ray image, but they may also not be providing the protection that we thought they were. However, it’s still important to take measures to minimize radiation exposure during medical procedures, and to continue reassessing the best practices for doing so.
