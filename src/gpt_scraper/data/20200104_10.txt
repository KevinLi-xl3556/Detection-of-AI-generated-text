After a rocky start to his NBA career, Lonzo Ball has found a new home in New Orleans and a renewed sense of confidence in his shot.
Drafted second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2017, Ball was touted as a franchise-changing point guard with elite passing abilities and a unique skill set. However, his first two seasons were marred by injuries and inconsistency, particularly in his shooting.
But all that changed when Ball was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in the summer of 2019. With a new team and a fresh start, Ball has been putting in the work to improve his shooting mechanics and gain the confidence he needs to become the player he was always meant to be.
In the 2020-21 NBA season, Ball has emerged as a reliable three-point shooter, with a career-high 37% success rate from beyond the arc. He’s also been more aggressive in driving to the basket and creating for himself and his teammates, averaging a career-high 14.6 points per game.
“I’ve been working on my shot a lot,” Ball recently told reporters. “Just getting reps up, just trying to stay confident. Whenever I’m open, just let it fly.”
Off the court, Ball credits his newfound success to his supportive teammates and coaches. “Just having guys that believe in you, having coaches that believe in you, it’s a great feeling,” he said.
This new chapter in Ball’s career has been marked by growth and maturity, both on and off the court. In addition to his improved shooting, he’s also become a more vocal leader and a better defender, with a career-high 1.5 steals per game.
As the Pelicans continue to build around their young core, Ball’s growth and development will be crucial to their success. With his newfound shooting touch and renewed confidence, he’s poised to become a key player for years to come.
For Ball, it’s all about staying focused and continuing to work hard. “I’m just trying to stay locked in, staying in the gym, and just keep working,” he said. “I know my best years are ahead of me.”
