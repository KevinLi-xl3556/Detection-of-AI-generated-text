Welcome to your Monday evening briefing! Here are the top stories you need to know about today: The Oscars, Iran, and College Football.
First up, the Oscars. Last night, Hollywood’s biggest stars gathered for the 95th Academy Awards ceremony. The event was filled with memorable moments, from Lady Gaga’s stunning performance of her hit song “Shallow” to Regina King’s emotional acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress. The big winners of the night were the film “Nomadland,” which took home awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress, and “The Father,” which won Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. Overall, it was a night to remember for the film industry.
In other news, tensions continue to rise between Iran and the United States. Earlier today, Iran’s top nuclear negotiator announced that the country has resumed enriching uranium to 60% purity, a level that is much higher than what is allowed under the 2015 nuclear deal. The move has been condemned by the U.S. and other world powers, who fear that Iran may be developing nuclear weapons. The situation is still developing, but it is clear that tensions between Iran and the U.S. are at an all-time high.
Finally, let’s turn our attention to college football. The sport is a staple of American culture, and it was on full display this past weekend as teams across the country competed in exciting matchups. One of the biggest games of the weekend was the matchup between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Arkansas Razorbacks, which Georgia won convincingly 37-0. Other notable games included the Iowa Hawkeyes’ upset victory over the Penn State Nittany Lions and the Texas Longhorns’ dramatic win over the Oklahoma Sooners in the annual Red River Rivalry.
