In a recent development, some NATO troops have started to withdraw from Iraq. This move comes after months of tensions between the US-led coalition and the Iraqi government.
NATO has been involved in the Iraq mission since 2004, with troops focusing on training and advising local security forces. However, tensions began to rise after the US assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike near the Baghdad airport in January. The attack prompted a retaliatory strike by Iran and sparked calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq.
In a joint statement, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi said that “a number of Allies have indicated their intention to reposition troops from Iraq to neighbouring countries, and to enhance NATO’s regional presence.” However, they stressed that NATO remains committed to the fight against terrorism in Iraq and will continue to provide support to the Iraqi security forces.
Notably, the statement did not mention the United States, which has a much larger presence in Iraq than any other NATO member. President Trump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw US troops from Iraq, but it’s unclear if and when that will happen.
The withdrawal of NATO troops will be a significant blow to the Iraqi government, which has relied on international support to fight against ISIS and maintain stability in the country. However, some Iraqis have long been critical of the presence of foreign troops on their soil, arguing that it undermines their sovereignty.
There are also concerns that the withdrawal could create a security vacuum that could be exploited by ISIS or other terrorist groups. Iraq is still struggling to recover from years of conflict and the withdrawal of NATO troops could make it even harder for the country to maintain stability.
Overall, the withdrawal of some NATO troops from Iraq is a significant development that could have important implications for the future of the country. While it’s unclear exactly how many troops will be leaving and when, the move is likely to fuel ongoing debates about the role of foreign troops in Iraq and the country’s long-term security prospects.
