The Decimation of Local News Has Lawmakers Crossing the Aisle
The decline of local news has become a serious concern for lawmakers across the political spectrum. As more and more newspapers shut down or reduce their coverage, there are fears that important stories will go untold and communities will become less informed.
In recent years, local news has faced an unprecedented crisis. The rise of digital media has led to a decline in print advertising revenue, which has been the lifeblood of many local newspapers. At the same time, many news organizations have struggled to adapt to the digital landscape, leaving them unable to compete with the likes of Facebook and Google for digital ad dollars.
The result has been a wave of layoffs and newspaper closures across the country. According to a report from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, over 2,100 newspapers have closed in the United States since 2004, leaving many communities without a reliable source of local news.
This decline in local news has had serious consequences. It has become increasingly difficult for residents to stay informed about important local issues, such as school board meetings, city council decisions, and changes to local zoning laws. Without local news, many of these stories go untold, leaving residents in the dark about the decisions that impact their daily lives.
Furthermore, the decline of local news has also had a negative impact on democracy. Local news is often the first line of defense against corruption and abuse of power. When there are fewer reporters covering local government, it becomes easier for politicians to act with impunity, knowing that there is less chance of their actions being scrutinized.
The importance of local news has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers. In recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concerns about the decline of local news and its impact on communities. Some have proposed solutions, such as tax credits for local news organizations or the creation of a national commission to study the issue.
In March 2021, a group of senators from both parties introduced the Local Journalism Sustainability Act, which would provide tax credits to local newspapers and other news organizations that invest in local news coverage. The bill has received bipartisan support and has been praised by advocates for local news.
“We need local journalism to keep our communities informed, hold public officials accountable, and provide a forum for diverse voices,” said Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), one of the bill’s sponsors. “This bill will help support the journalists and news organizations who are doing this important work.”
The decline of local news is a serious issue that affects everyone. As lawmakers from both parties recognize, the loss of local news is a threat to our democracy and our communities. It is crucial that we find ways to support local news organizations and ensure that they can continue to provide the important coverage that our communities need.
