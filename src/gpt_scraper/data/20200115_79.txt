Bruce Springsteen’s Son Becomes a Jersey City Firefighter
The youngest son of Bruce Springsteen, Sam Springsteen, has officially graduated from the New Jersey Fire Academy and is now working as a Jersey City firefighter. The news was revealed in a recent Instagram post by Sam’s mother, Patti Scialfa.
Sam is no stranger to hard work or service. Before pursuing a career in firefighting, he worked as a volunteer firefighter in Colts Neck, New Jersey. In addition, he served as a military policeman in the United States Army.
His love for firefighting began during his teenage years when he volunteered as a firefighter at a local fire station. After completing his military service, his strong sense of community and desire to serve led him to pursue a career in this field.
It’s not surprising that Sam chose this career path. His father, Bruce Springsteen, is known for his support of firemen, particularly after the events of September 11th, 2001, when he performed a benefit concert with the E Street Band in support of the FDNY.
In addition to his firefighting duties, Sam is also a talented musician. He has performed with his parents on stage and has released his own music under the pseudonym “Samuel Ryan.” He recognizes the importance of balancing his musical career with his firefighting duties, stating in an interview, “My job is very important to me because it’s a job where you’re helping people. It’s also very patriotic because of the history of firefighters in this country.”
Sam’s new role as a Jersey City firefighter means that he will be serving one of the busiest and most diverse cities in the state. The department responds to over 100,000 incidents annually and serves a population of over 265,000.
In a time where public servants are being applauded for their bravery and selflessness, it’s heartening to see Sam Springsteen joining the ranks of these everyday heroes. As his mother stated in her Instagram post, “We are very proud of you.” His dedication to service and his commitment to his community are an inspiration to us all.
