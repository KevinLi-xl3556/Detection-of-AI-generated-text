Nancy Lewis, a publicist who played a vital role in introducing the British comedy troupe Monty Python to American audiences, has died at the age of 76.
Lewis was born in San Francisco in 1946 and began her career in the entertainment industry as a publicist for the American folk music scene in the early 1960s. In the early 1970s, she became a publicist for rock bands, including the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane. It was during this time that Lewis met Monty Python, a group of British comedians who were gaining popularity in the UK with their surreal and irreverent brand of comedy.
Lewis recognized the potential of Monty Python’s humor in the United States and began working with the group to promote their work in America. She organized their first US tour in 1973, which included performances at the City Center in New York and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. The tour was a success, and Monty Python’s popularity in America continued to grow.
Lewis went on to work as a publicist for other British comedians, including Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, and also represented the British film industry in America. She later became the head of publicity for Warner Bros. in London, where she worked on the promotion of films such as “Chariots of Fire” and “Blade Runner.”
In a statement, Monty Python member Michael Palin paid tribute to Lewis, saying, “Nancy was instrumental in helping us find an audience in America. She was a remarkable person and a true professional. We will miss her greatly.”
Lewis is survived by her husband, film producer Keith Cavele, and their two children.
Lewis’ legacy as a publicist for Monty Python and other British comedians is undeniable. Her efforts helped to introduce British humor to American audiences and paved the way for future collaborations between the two countries. Her contributions to the entertainment industry will be remembered for years to come.
