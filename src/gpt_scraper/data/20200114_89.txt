France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have served a notice on Iran under the nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), expressing concerns about the country’s continued violations of the agreement.
The move comes after Iran announced earlier this year that it was suspending some of its obligations under the deal, following the US withdrawal from the agreement in 2018 and the reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.
In a joint statement, the European countries said they were “deeply concerned by Iran’s announcement” and that they remained committed to the JCPOA, which aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.
“We call on Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the JCPOA, and to refrain from further escalatory steps,” the statement said.
The three countries also expressed their intention to use the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement to address their concerns. This mechanism allows parties to the deal to raise issues of non-compliance and seek a resolution within a set timeframe. If the issue is not resolved, it could lead to the re-imposition of UN sanctions.
The move by France, Germany, and the UK was welcomed by the US, which has been trying to bring Iran back to the negotiating table to reach a new deal that would address its concerns over Tehran’s nuclear program, as well as its regional activities and ballistic missile program.
“We support the actions taken by our European allies today,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. “We have been clear that we are ready to engage in meaningful diplomacy to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA.”
The US has been in indirect talks with Iran in Vienna since early April, mediated by the remaining parties to the JCPOA - China, France, Germany, Russia, and the UK. The talks have been aimed at finding a way to bring Iran back into compliance with the deal and lift US sanctions.
However, the talks have been complicated by Iran’s presidential elections, scheduled for June, as well as its insistence that the US lift all sanctions imposed since 2017, including those unrelated to the nuclear deal.
The European countries’ notice to Iran under the dispute resolution mechanism could further complicate the talks, but it also sends a signal that the JCPOA remains important to the international community and that violations of the agreement will not be tolerated.
“The E3’s decision today is an important step in upholding the integrity of the JCPOA and demonstrating that the international community is united in its commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation,” Price said. “We look forward to continuing to work closely with our allies and partners to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA.”
