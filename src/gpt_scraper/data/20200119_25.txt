How U.S. Firms Helped Africa’s Richest Woman Exploit Her Country’s Wealth
For many years, Angola has been one of the wealthiest countries in Africa, with vast natural resources including diamonds, oil, and fish. However, much of the country’s wealth has been siphoned off by a ruling elite, including Isabel dos Santos, who is considered the richest woman in Africa. While dos Santos has built her fortune on the back of her family’s political connections, U.S. firms have played a significant role in helping her exploit her country’s resources.
Isabel dos Santos is the daughter of Angola’s former president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who governed the country for nearly four decades. During his rule, Angola became one of Africa’s top oil producers and saw significant economic growth. However, much of the country’s wealth benefited the ruling elite, including dos Santos, who became a billionaire through a mix of insider deals and nepotism.
One way that dos Santos and her family were able to enrich themselves was through ties to U.S. firms. For example, in 2010, a company called Cobalt International Energy obtained the rights to drill for oil in Angola’s waters in a deal worth $1.3 billion. At the time, Isabel dos Santos held a significant stake in the company through her father’s government. Cobalt’s CEO, Joseph Bryant, praised the deal as a “transformative event” for the company, and several major U.S. investment firms, including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, invested in the firm.
However, the deal was also controversial, with critics saying that Cobalt had gained the rights to drill in Angolan waters through corrupt means. In 2011, Isabel dos Santos sold her stake in the company for a reported $350 million, making a significant profit. Later, Cobalt’s operations in Angola came under scrutiny by U.S. regulators, who investigated claims of bribery and other corrupt practices. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2017.
Another U.S. firm that has come under scrutiny for its ties to Isabel dos Santos is Boston Consulting Group (BCG). According to an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, BCG provided consulting services to several companies owned by dos Santos, including the state-run oil company Sonangol. The investigation found that BCG helped dos Santos set up offshore companies, which she used to conceal her wealth and avoid taxes.
BCG has said that it did not know about dos Santos’ alleged corrupt activities and that it is committed to upholding ethical standards. However, the firm’s ties to dos Santos have raised questions about its role in facilitating corruption in Angola.
Overall, the case of Isabel dos Santos, and her ties to U.S. firms, highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the global business community. While U.S. companies may see opportunity in investing in resource-rich countries, they must also be aware of the risks of engaging in corrupt practices. By working with corrupt elites, U.S. firms may be contributing to the exploitation of poor and vulnerable populations, and undermining efforts to promote democracy and human rights around the world.
