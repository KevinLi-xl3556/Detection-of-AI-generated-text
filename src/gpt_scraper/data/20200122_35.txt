The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that has been in the works since the early 20th century, and it is more relevant now than ever before. Despite being initially proposed in 1923, the ERA has yet to be ratified and become law. The landmark amendment seeks to guarantee that equal rights under the law should not be denied or abridged on account of gender. Here’s why we need the Equal Rights Amendment.
Firstly, the ERA will enshrine gender equality in the constitution, making it harder to roll back policies and protections for women. While the U.S. federal and state governments have passed numerous laws and policies to promote gender equality since the civil rights era, the ERA will ensure that these efforts cannot be easily undone by future administrations.
Secondly, women’s rights are human rights. The ERA seeks to ensure that women receive equal protection under the fourteenth amendment. Gender discrimination remains a pervasive issue in the U.S., impacting all segments of American society from the workplace to the criminal justice system. Women continue to earn less than men for the same work, have less representation in government, and are more vulnerable to violence.
Thirdly, ratifying the ERA will inspire gender equality movements globally. The document will serve as an inspiration to women and advocates for gender equality around the world, many of whom look to the United States as a symbol of democratic principles and human rights. Numerous countries have already ratified similar documents promoting gender equality, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
In conclusion, the Equal Rights Amendment is long overdue, and it’s time for the United States to take concrete steps towards advancing gender equality. Ratifying the ERA is essential to achieving a more just and equitable society for all. The U.S. should join the ranks of countries pushing towards gender equality, and the ERA would be a critical step in that direction.
