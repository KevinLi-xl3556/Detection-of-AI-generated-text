On January 1st, 2023, South Bend, Indiana inaugurated its new mayor, a young and ambitious politician who is succeeding the city’s most famous mayor, Pete Buttigieg. After serving two terms as mayor of South Bend, Buttigieg went on to become a presidential candidate in the 2020 elections and was later appointed as the United States Secretary of Transportation by President Joe Biden.
With the departure of Mayor Pete, the city was left with big shoes to fill. However, the new mayor, whose name is James Sullivan, seems ready to take on the challenge. Sullivan, like Buttigieg, is a young politician with a background in public service. He has served as a city councilman for the past eight years and has been instrumental in many of the city’s recent initiatives.
In his inaugural address, Sullivan emphasized his commitment to continuing the progress made by Buttigieg and his team. “Mayor Pete and his administration have done incredible work for this city,” Sullivan said. “And I am honored to have the opportunity to build on that foundation and take South Bend to new heights.”
Sullivan also highlighted some of his own priorities for the city, including investing in public transportation, creating more affordable housing, and supporting small businesses. He also pledged to work towards making South Bend a more inclusive and welcoming city for all its residents.
Buttigieg himself was in attendance at the inauguration and had some kind words for his successor. “I have no doubt that Mayor Sullivan will continue to make South Bend a better place,” he said. “He has the passion, the intelligence, and the dedication to succeed.”
The departure of Buttigieg is bittersweet for many residents of South Bend. On the one hand, they are proud of their former mayor’s achievements and are excited to see him take on a new role in the federal government. On the other hand, they will miss the dynamic and charismatic leader who brought so much energy and enthusiasm to the city.
However, with the inauguration of James Sullivan, South Bend can look forward to a new era of leadership and progress. Sullivan has big shoes to fill, but he seems up to the task. And with the support of the community behind him, he is sure to make a positive impact on the city and its residents.
