Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos visited India in January 2020, but his trip was not without controversy. The e-commerce giant had been facing scrutiny from Indian regulators over allegations of anti-competitive practices, and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had launched an investigation into the company.
In fact, just days before Bezos’ visit, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) filed a complaint with the CCI alleging that Amazon was engaging in unfair practices, including offering deep discounts to customers and preferential treatment to certain sellers on its platform.
The CAIT, a trade body representing millions of small businesses in India, claimed that Amazon’s actions were driving local traders out of business and hurting the Indian economy. The organization also accused Amazon of flouting India’s foreign investment rules by controlling inventory and influencing prices on its platform.
Bezos’ visit to India was seen as an attempt to smooth over tensions with the Indian government and win over small traders who had been critical of Amazon’s presence in the country. However, the CAIT used the occasion to step up its campaign against the e-commerce giant, staging protests and calling for a boycott of Amazon.
The CCI investigation into Amazon is ongoing, but the company has maintained that it is fully compliant with Indian laws and regulations. In a statement, Amazon said that it was “committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations” and that it was “confident that our activities are in compliance with Indian law.”
The company has also invested heavily in India, with Bezos announcing in 2020 that Amazon would be investing $1 billion in the country to help small businesses digitize and expand their operations. The move was seen as an attempt to win over Indian regulators and demonstrate Amazon’s commitment to the country.
However, the CAIT and other trade groups remain skeptical of Amazon’s intentions, and the company continues to face challenges in India. In 2021, the Indian government implemented new rules for e-commerce companies, including a ban on exclusive deals and a requirement to disclose the origin of products sold on their platforms.
These regulations are seen as a victory for small traders and a blow to Amazon’s business model, which relies heavily on exclusive deals and private labels. The company has criticized the new rules, saying that they will “have a significant impact on the growth of e-commerce in India.”
Despite the challenges, Amazon remains committed to India, which is seen as a key market for the company’s future growth. However, the company will need to navigate the complex regulatory environment and win over local traders if it wants to succeed in India. Whether or not the CCI investigation leads to any action against Amazon remains to be seen, but the company is likely to face continued scrutiny in the coming years.
