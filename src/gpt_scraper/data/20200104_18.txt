Did the Killing of Qassim Suleimani Deter Iranian Attacks, or Encourage Them?
On January 3, 2020, the world was rocked by the news of the killing of Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian military commander, in a targeted U.S. drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. Suleimani was the head of Iran’s Quds Force, a secretive unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for Iran’s extraterritorial military operations. The killing of Suleimani was a dramatic and controversial move by the United States, and it sparked a flurry of debates and discussions about its implications for the volatile region of the Middle East. One of the key questions that arose was whether the killing of Suleimani would deter Iranian attacks or encourage them.
The U.S. justified the killing of Suleimani by citing his role in orchestrating and supporting attacks against U.S. interests and personnel in the Middle East. According to U.S. officials, Suleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and was actively planning new attacks. The U.S. argued that his elimination was necessary to protect American lives and to deter further Iranian aggression in the region.
In the immediate aftermath of Suleimani’s killing, there was a spike in tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Iran vowed revenge and retaliated by launching ballistic missiles at two U.S. military bases in Iraq, causing some injuries but no fatalities. Iran also escalated its rhetoric and threats against the U.S. and its allies in the region, leading to fears of an all-out war in the Middle East. However, despite the initial escalation, the situation did not spiral out of control, and both sides seemed to step back from the brink of war.
In the weeks and months following Suleimani’s killing, the situation in the region remained tense, but there was no large-scale military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran. Instead, Iran opted for a strategy of asymmetric warfare, using its proxies and allies in the region to carry out attacks against U.S. interests and personnel indirectly. There were a number of attacks on U.S. bases and diplomatic facilities in Iraq, as well as on ships in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. responded with limited military strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, but overall, the situation did not escalate into a full-blown war.
So, did the killing of Suleimani deter Iranian attacks, or encourage them? The answer is not clear-cut and remains a subject of debate among experts and policymakers. Proponents of the U.S. action argue that it sent a strong message to Iran that its malign activities in the region would not be tolerated and that the killing of a top Iranian military commander would serve as a deterrent against further Iranian aggression. They point to the fact that Iran did not launch a large-scale military retaliation against the U.S. after Suleimani’s killing and that the situation did not escalate into a full-blown war.
However, critics of the U.S. action argue that it was a reckless move that risked plunging the region into a catastrophic war. They argue that the killing of Suleimani was a provocative act that violated international law and norms, and that it was likely to inflame anti-American sentiment in the region and galvanize Iran and its proxies to carry out more attacks against the U.S. and its allies. They point to the fact that Iran did retaliate, albeit indirectly, through its proxies in the region, and that the situation in the Middle East remains volatile and unpredictable.
One thing that is clear is that the killing of Suleimani did not put an end to
