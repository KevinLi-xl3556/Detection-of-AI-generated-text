The annual “Super Mega” Crossword Contest has once again come to a close, and the winners have been announced. This highly anticipated event draws in thousands of crossword enthusiasts from around the world, all vying for the grand prize of $50,000 and bragging rights as the top crossword solver.
The contest, which spans over several weeks, consists of a series of increasingly challenging crossword puzzles, with each puzzle getting progressively harder. Contestants are given a set amount of time to complete each puzzle, and the top performers move on to the next round.
This year’s contest was no exception, with puzzles designed to challenge even the most seasoned crossword pros. From tricky wordplay to obscure references, the puzzles tested the limits of each contestant’s knowledge and problem-solving skills.
But despite the challenges, a select few were able to rise to the occasion and emerge as winners. In the first part of our winner’s series, we’ll take a look at some of the standout performers from this year’s “Super Mega” Crossword Contest.
First up is William, a retired schoolteacher from Maine. William has been an avid crossword solver for over 40 years and has even created his own puzzles. He credits his success in the contest to his wide range of interests and a lifetime of reading and learning. William finished in the top 10% of contestants and received a cash prize of $500.
Next is Karen, a software engineer from California. Karen had never participated in a crossword contest before but decided to give it a try this year. She quickly found that her analytical skills from her job translated well to crossword solving, and she was able to make it to the final round. Karen finished in 5th place and took home a cash prize of $5,000.
But the top prize went to Marcus, a college student from New York. Marcus has been solving crosswords since he was a child and has participated in the “Super Mega” contest for the past three years.
