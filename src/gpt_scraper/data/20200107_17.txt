Inside the Billion-Dollar Battle Over .Org
The Internet is a vast and sprawling network of websites and domains, but one of the most important and influential domains is .org. Originally created as a domain for non-profit organizations, .org has become something much bigger over the years, with many for-profit companies and other entities also making their homes on the domain.
Recently, there has been a major battle brewing over the future ownership of .org, with a multi-billion dollar deal at the heart of the controversy. Many non-profit organizations are deeply concerned about the potential impact of this deal, and are pushing back against those who would seek to gain control of the domain.
At the center of the controversy is the Internet Society, a non-profit organization that has owned the .org domain for years. In November of 2019, the Internet Society announced that it had struck a deal to sell the domain to a private equity firm called Ethos Capital. The price tag for this deal was a staggering $1.13 billion, making it one of the largest domain sales in history.
For the Internet Society, the decision to sell the .org domain was based on a desire to focus on other projects and initiatives. The organization had been struggling financially for years, and saw the sale as a way to secure its future and continue its work. However, many non-profits and other organizations saw the sale as a major threat to their own interests.
The concern among many non-profits is that a for-profit entity like Ethos Capital would be more focused on profits than on serving the needs of non-profit organizations. Many also worry that the new owners of .org would hike up prices and engage in aggressive marketing tactics that could harm non-profits and other groups that rely on the domain.
As news of the sale began to spread, there was an immediate backlash among non-profits and other groups. Many organizations signed onto an open letter calling for the sale to be stopped, and some even threatened legal action to prevent it from going through.
In response to this pressure, Ethos Capital and the Internet Society announced a series of changes to the deal, including a pledge to create a stewardship council to oversee the use of the .org domain and a promise to limit price hikes to no more than 10% per year.
These changes have not been enough to satisfy everyone, however. Many non-profits and other groups remain deeply concerned about the potential impact of the sale, and are continuing to push back against it. Some are even calling for alternative solutions to be explored, including community ownership of the .org domain.
One thing is clear: the battle over .org is far from over. Non-profits and other groups will continue to fight for their interests and concerns, even as the deal moves forward. The outcome of this battle will have far-reaching implications for the future of the Internet and the role that non-profit organizations play in shaping it.
