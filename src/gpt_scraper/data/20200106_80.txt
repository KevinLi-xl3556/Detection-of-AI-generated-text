In the race for the democratic nomination, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have shown stark differences in their approach to foreign policy. Both candidates have not only made their stances clear but have also highlighted these differences in public.
Joe Biden, a former Vice President and a seasoned diplomat, emphasizes traditional American diplomatic engagement. He acknowledges the necessity of a military presence in some countries, while maintaining that diplomacy should always be the first option. Biden also prioritizes repairing relationships with traditional allies, such as NATO, and establishing new ones. He has been an advocate for transatlantic cooperation and has effectively worked toward creating a more collaborative environment for military, economic and diplomatic endeavors.
Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, is a long-time advocate for a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy. He believes that the United States has been involved in unnecessary conflicts, wasting both resources and human lives. Sanders is a staunch critic of the military-industrial complex, which he believes only benefits corporations and wage war on other countries. He emphasizes the necessity of diplomatically resolving disputes between nations and believes that economic sanctions could be a more effective tool than military intervention. He has often called attention to issues such as climate change, economic inequality, and workers’ rights, which he believes should form the new framework for foreign policy.
The two candidates’ views have presented clear contrasts throughout the campaign. For example, during the recent Vice Presidential debate, Kamala Harris attacked Mike Pence for his administration’s foreign policy, noting a sharp decline in American diplomats abroad. Joe Biden, however, argued that the US ought to continue a diplomatic effort to gain ground, whereas Sanders has often advocated that military withdrawal.
The contrast between Biden and Sanders is striking, and each candidate is happy to expound on his philosophy. Biden has emphasized the importance of maintaining America’s traditional alliances and creating new relationships with countries worldwide. Sanders, who urges against needless and harmful international policies, is more inclined to the gradual dismantling of the far-reaching US military presence.
As the election approaches, foreign policy remains a crucial issue for American voters. The US’ international relationships affect economic, social, and security issues, and so the stance each candidate takes on foreign policy is significant. Biden and Sanders have shown clear distinctions in their approach to foreign policy, and each has articulated his views in plain language, enabling voters to make informed decisions. They’re happy to tell you so.
