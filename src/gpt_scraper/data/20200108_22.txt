Peter Kirstein, Father of the European Internet, Is Dead at 86
Peter Kirstein, the British computer scientist known as the “Father of the European internet”, passed away on June 8, 2020, at the age of 86. Kirstein made critical contributions to the development of the internet in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. He was widely regarded as a pioneer in internet technology and his legacy in the field continues to this day.
Kirstein was born in Germany in 1933 and moved to the United Kingdom in 1940. He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge and received a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1965. After returning to the UK, Kirstein began his work on computer networking and the development of the internet.
In the 1960s, Kirstein advocated for the creation of a data communications network linking research institutions in the UK. He led the team that developed the first international computer network, which connected researchers in Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1973.
Kirstein also played a crucial role in the development of the European Academic and Research Network (EARN), which was established in the early 1980s. EARN was one of the first international computer networks, connecting researchers and academics across Europe. It provided an early model for the modern internet and helped to pave the way for the growth of the World Wide Web.
Throughout his career, Kirstein was a strong advocate for open standards and interoperability in computer networking. He believed that these principles were essential for allowing different computer systems to communicate with one another and for fostering collaboration across borders.
Kirstein’s contributions to the development of the internet were recognized with numerous awards and honors. In 2017, he was presented with the Postel Service Award by the Internet Society, which recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the advancement of the internet.
Peter Kirstein’s passing is a significant loss for the computer networking community and the wider field of technology.
