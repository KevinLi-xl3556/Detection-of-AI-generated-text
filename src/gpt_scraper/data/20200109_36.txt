On Tuesday, January 7th, 2020, Puerto Rico was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake, the strongest in over a century. The earthquake caused significant damage and destruction, leaving thousands of Puerto Ricans without shelter or access to basic necessities. Nearly three days after the earthquake, many people are still living outdoors, afraid to go back into their homes.
The earthquake’s epicenter was located near Ponce, which is located in the southern part of the island. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, several aftershocks ranging from 5.0 to 5.9 magnitude were felt across the island, causing further damage and shaking the nerves of already-fearful residents.
The impact of the earthquake has left many people without homes or access to basic necessities such as food, water, and power. The island’s infrastructure was already struggling prior to the earthquake, and this natural disaster has worsened conditions in several areas.
According to reports, nearly 300,000 households –almost a million people– have been impacted, with thousands displaced from their homes. Hundreds of buildings and homes have been damaged or destroyed, with the government predicting that the cost of damage could run up to $3.1 billion.
As a result, many Puerto Ricans remain outdoors, sleeping in parks, cars, or even tents. The risks of aftershocks and further damage has caused many people to be fearful of returning to their homes. This has created an emergency situation, with many people unable to access basic necessities like food and medical aid.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has already declared Puerto Rico a disaster zone, and it is working with local authorities to provide support and relief to those affected. However, there have been mixed reactions from locals on the government’s handling of the disaster, with many saying aid is taking too long to arrive or is insufficient.
Furthermore, Puerto Rico’s recent history with natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria in 2017, has caused many locals to be skeptical of the government’s ability to handle this current situation. This skepticism stems from concerns about the slow and inadequate response to past natural disasters.
It is not yet known how long it will take for Puerto Ricans to have access to safe and stable housing. The situation is still unfolding three days after the earthquake hit, and many residents are living in uncertain and challenging conditions. It is clear that aid and relief efforts must be prioritized, and support from communities and organizations around the world is necessary to ensure that Puerto Ricans can fully recover from this disaster.
