Gibney, a contemporary dance organization based in New York City, is set to receive a generous grant aimed at transforming the company into a repertory company. The grant is a significant milestone for Gibney, which has been a trailblazer in the dance world for over 25 years, establishing itself as a leading voice for social change through dance.
The $3 million grant comes from an anonymous donor who is passionate about the arts and believes in the power of repertory companies to showcase works from a variety of choreographers. The funding will be used to commission new works from established and emerging choreographers, as well as to revive classic works from the past.
“We are thrilled to receive this grant, which will enable us to expand the reach of our company and further our mission of using dance to effect social change,” said Gina Gibney, founder and artistic director of Gibney. “We believe that a repertory company is the best way to showcase the breadth of work that is out there, and to provide artists with a platform to create and collaborate.”
The grant will not only allow Gibney to strengthen its artistic programming but also to provide more opportunities for the development and mentorship of emerging choreographers. As a repertory company, Gibney will be able to showcase a wide range of works, from classical ballet to contemporary dance, providing audiences with a rich and diverse experience.
“We are excited to see how this grant will help Gibney continue to grow and evolve as a dance organization,” said the anonymous donor. “We believe that a repertory company is a vital part of the dance world, and we are proud to support Gibney in this endeavor.”
The transformation into a repertory company is a significant step for Gibney, and one that will enable the organization to broaden its impact and reach new audiences. With a renewed focus on the commissioning of new works and the revival of classic works, Gibney is poised to continue making an impact in the dance world and beyond.
