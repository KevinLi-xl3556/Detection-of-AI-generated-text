In a major development in a long-running legal saga, a judge has signaled approval of the University of Southern California’s $215 million settlement with patients of a former campus gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct.
U.S.C. agreed to the settlement in March 2021, after hundreds of women came forward with allegations of abuse against Dr. George Tyndall. The settlement will be split among roughly 710 women, who will receive payouts ranging from $2,500 to $250,000 depending on the severity of the abuse they suffered.
The agreement is one of the largest payouts ever by a university in a sexual abuse case. However, it still needs final approval from U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who has been overseeing the case. On April 23, Judge Wilson issued a tentative ruling indicating that he intends to approve the settlement.
“The Court concludes that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate,” Judge Wilson wrote in his ruling. “It provides significant relief to class members and avoids the risks and uncertainty of continued litigation.”
The ruling is not final, and Judge Wilson will still hear arguments from both sides before issuing a final decision. However, his tentative ruling is seen as a positive sign for U.S.C., which has faced intense criticism over its handling of the Tyndall case.
Tyndall worked as a gynecologist at U.S.C.’s student health center for nearly 30 years, until he was fired in 2017. He was later arrested and charged with 29 counts of sexual abuse, but has yet to stand trial due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
U.S.C. has acknowledged that it received complaints about Tyndall’s behavior as early as the 1990s, but failed to take action against him. The university has since apologized to Tyndall’s patients and implemented new policies aimed at preventing sexual abuse on campus.
The settlement with Tyndall’s patients is just one of several high-profile cases involving sexual abuse at U.S.C. In 2018, the university agreed to pay $215 million to settle a separate lawsuit brought by hundreds of women who accused a former campus gynecologist, Dr. James Heaps, of sexual misconduct.
The Tyndall and Heaps cases have led to widespread scrutiny of U.S.C.’s handling of sexual abuse allegations, and prompted calls for greater accountability and transparency from university officials. With the approval of the Tyndall settlement, U.S.C. has taken a significant step towards resolving one of the darkest chapters in its history.
