Iraq, Carlos Ghosn, Tumbleweeds: Your Thursday Evening Briefing
Welcome to your Thursday evening briefing, where we bring you the latest news and updates from around the world. Today, we’ll be discussing Iraq, Carlos Ghosn, and tumbleweeds. Let’s dive in.
Iraq
In Iraq, violence continues to escalate as the country prepares for its upcoming elections. On Thursday, a car bomb exploded in a busy market in the city of Sadr City, killing at least four people and injuring several others. The attack was the latest in a series of bombings and assassinations targeting politicians and activists in the run-up to the elections.
The elections, which are scheduled to take place in October, are seen as a critical test of Iraq’s fragile democracy. However, many Iraqis are skeptical that the polls will be free and fair, given the ongoing violence and political instability in the country.
Carlos Ghosn
In other news, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has agreed to pay a $1.5 million settlement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over charges of misleading investors about his compensation. The settlement comes after a long legal battle between Ghosn and the SEC, which accused him of concealing more than $140 million in compensation from Nissan investors.
Ghosn, who was once one of the most powerful executives in the automotive industry, was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of financial misconduct. He fled to Lebanon in 2019 while awaiting trial and has since been living in exile.
Tumbleweeds
Finally, in a lighter story, residents of a small town in eastern Washington state are being overrun by tumbleweeds. The town of Richland has been hit by an unusual number of the spiky, rolling plants, which have piled up against homes and blocked driveways.
Local officials say that the tumbleweed invasion is due to a combination of factors, including dry weather and changes in farming practices. Residents are now banding together to clear the tumbleweeds and prevent them from causing further damage.
