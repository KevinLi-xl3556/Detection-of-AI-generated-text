The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, held in the Swiss mountain town of Davos, has long been seen as a gathering of the world’s elite. The conference brings together political leaders, business executives, and academics to discuss the global economy and other pressing issues facing the planet.
In recent years, the event has taken on added significance, as the rise of populism and nationalism around the world has put the Davos plutocrats on the defensive. The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016 was seen as a major blow to the globalist vision of the Davos elites.
But now, as Trump begins his second year in office, the tone among the Davos crowd is shifting. Many attendees at this year’s conference are starting to warm up to the Trump administration.
One reason for this is the strong performance of the U.S. economy under Trump. The stock market has been on a tear, and unemployment is at its lowest level in decades. This has led many business leaders to overlook Trump’s controversial rhetoric and policies, and instead focus on his pro-business agenda.
Another factor is the Trump administration’s tax reform plan, which was passed into law in December. The plan includes significant corporate tax cuts, which are expected to boost the economy even further. This has won praise from many attendees at Davos, who see it as a sign that Trump is serious about promoting economic growth.
Of course, not everyone at the conference is thrilled with the Trump administration. The President’s criticism of free trade and his America-first approach to foreign policy are still viewed with suspicion and concern by many attendees.
But overall, the mood at Davos seems to be shifting in favor of Trump. Whether this is a temporary trend or a long-term shift remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the Davos plutocrats are starting to warm up to the Trump administration.
