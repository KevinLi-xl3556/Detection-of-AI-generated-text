Welcome to your Tuesday evening briefing. Today we’ll be discussing three topics that have dominated the news cycle in recent days: impeachment, the 2020 debate, and Andy Warhol.
Impeachment
As you’re likely aware, the United States is in the midst of its fourth impeachment trial in history. President Trump stands accused of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. The impeachment trial has been ongoing for several weeks now, with arguments from both sides being heard in the Senate.
Today, the Senate heard from former national security adviser John Bolton, who reportedly claims in his upcoming book that President Trump explicitly told him that he wanted to withhold military aid from Ukraine until they agreed to investigate the Bidens. This bombshell revelation has reignited calls for witnesses to be called in the impeachment trial, something that Senate Republicans have thus far resisted.
The 2020 Debate
Last night saw the seventh Democratic presidential debate, held in Des Moines, Iowa. The debate was the last before the Iowa caucuses, which kick off the primary season next week. The six candidates on stage - Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Tom Steyer - clashed on a variety of issues, including healthcare, foreign policy, and climate change.
One of the standout moments of the night came when Sanders and Warren - who have largely avoided attacking each other throughout the campaign - sparred over a report that Sanders had told Warren in 2018 that he didn’t think a woman could win the presidency. Sanders denied the accusation, while Warren stuck by her claim. The exchange highlighted the tensions between the two progressive candidates and raised questions about whether their relationship can survive the campaign.
Andy Warhol
Finally, in the art world, a major retrospective of Andy Warhol’s work has opened at the Tate Modern in London. The exhibition features over 100 of Warhol’s works, including his iconic soup cans, Marilyn Monroe portraits, and self-portraits. The show also includes lesser-known works from throughout Warhol’s career, highlighting his experimentation with different mediums and techniques.
Warhol is one of the most important artists of the 20th century, known for his ability to capture the essence of American culture and celebrity through his art. His work continues to be influential today, inspiring a new generation of artists to explore the intersection of art, commerce, and popular culture.
