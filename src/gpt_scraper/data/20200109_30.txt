Body Temperature 2.0: Do We Need to Rethink What’s Normal?
For centuries, a body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (or 37 degrees Celsius) has been considered the standard “normal” temperature for the human body. However, recent research suggests that this may not be the case anymore.
In a study published in the journal eLife in 2017, researchers from Stanford University School of Medicine analyzed nearly 700,000 temperature readings from over 11,000 individuals and found that the average body temperature has dropped by 0.05 degrees Celsius per decade since the 1860s. This means that the average body temperature of people today is around 0.6 degrees Celsius lower than what was considered normal in the past.
But what could be causing this change? Some scientists speculate that it could be due to a number of factors, including changes in lifestyle, improvements in healthcare, and the fact that we no longer face the same environmental challenges that our ancestors did.
For example, our bodies no longer have to fight off the same kinds of infections and diseases that they did in the past, thanks to advances in medicine and sanitation. Additionally, we are now able to regulate our body temperature more effectively with things like air conditioning and central heating.
Despite these changes, some researchers argue that we still need to rethink what’s considered a “normal” body temperature. In a paper published in the journal JAMA Network Open in 2020, researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine argue that a temperature of 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or 36.4 degrees Celsius) should be considered the new normal.
They based their recommendation on a study of nearly 35,000 patients in the United States, which found that the average body temperature was actually 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit, rather than 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, should we all be aiming for a body temperature of 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit? Not necessarily. While it’s true that the average body temperature may have decreased over time, individual body temperatures can still vary widely based on factors like age, sex, and activity level.
Additionally, body temperature can fluctuate throughout the day and in response to certain external factors like illness, stress, and exercise. Therefore, it’s important to pay attention to your own body and monitor your temperature if you’re feeling unwell or experiencing other symptoms.
In conclusion, the idea of a “normal” body temperature is not as clear-cut as we once thought. While it’s true that the average body temperature may have decreased over time, there is still a wide range of temperatures that can be considered normal for individuals. Ultimately, the most important thing is to listen to your own body and seek medical attention if you’re feeling unwell.
