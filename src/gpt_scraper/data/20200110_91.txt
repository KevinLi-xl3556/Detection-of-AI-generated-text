Marijuana: Where N.Y. Stands on Legalization
In recent years, there has been a significant shift in public opinion on marijuana legalization in the United States. The legalization of marijuana has been a popular topic of debate across the country for several years now, with some states taking the lead in legalizing the drug for both medical and recreational use. In New York, the issue of marijuana legalization has been a hot topic in recent years with activists and lawmakers pushing for the legalization of the drug.
Currently, marijuana is illegal in New York State for recreational use, although it has been decriminalized since 2019. This means possession of up to two ounces of marijuana will result in a fine rather than a criminal charge. Medical marijuana has been legal in New York since 2014, and patients with eligible conditions can obtain it through a licensed dispensary.
However, with a new legislative session in New York, supporters of marijuana legalization are hoping for a breakthrough. Governor Andrew Cuomo has been vocal about legalizing marijuana in the state, and in early 2021, he proposed legalizing the drug for recreational use as a part of his state budget proposal. Cuomo’s proposed bill would allow the possession, sale, and use of marijuana by adults aged 21 and over, with a tax collected on sales that would generate revenue for the state.
The proposal has been met with mixed reactions from lawmakers within the state, with some expressing support for the bill and others pushing back against it. Critics argue that legalization will lead to an increase in drug addiction and harm communities of color, where drug laws have been enforced more stringently. Proponents argue that legalizing marijuana will provide new business opportunities and revenue sources for the state, as well as reduce arrests and incarcerations for non-violent drug offenses.
A recent poll conducted by Siena Research Institute found that a majority of New York voters support legalizing marijuana for recreational use. According to the poll, 60% of voters are in favor of legalizing marijuana, while only 32% oppose it. Additionally, the poll found support for legalization across demographic groups, with majorities of both men and women, as well as voters in every age group, expressing support for legalization.
Where does New York stand on the legalization of marijuana? It’s hard to say at this point. While Governor Cuomo has been an advocate for legalization, there is still strong opposition to the proposal among some lawmakers. However, the majority of New York voters seem to support legalization, which may put pressure on lawmakers to reconsider their stance. As the legislative session continues, we will have to wait and see whether New York will join the growing number of states that have legalized marijuana.
