A Blow to the Head Makes an Instant Hero in India
In a country where heroism is often associated with physical power and bravery, a recent incident in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has sparked a new debate on the limits and sources of heroism. On August 29, a young man named Javed Khan reportedly stopped a speeding train from running over a group of children who were playing on a railway track, by using his own head as a buffer. Though Khan suffered serious injuries and had to be hospitalized, he became an instant hero in the local community and beyond.
The incident occurred in the town of Hathras, where Khan, a 33-year-old welder, was working in a nearby factory. According to eyewitnesses, a group of children were playing on a railway track near a slum when they suddenly saw a speeding train coming towards them. The children tried to run away, but one of them fell and got stuck in a gap between the tracks. As the train approached, there was little time left for anyone to act. That’s when Khan, who was working nearby, reportedly decided to risk his life to save the child.
Without hesitating, Khan ran towards the track and lay on it, with his head positioned just below the gap where the child was trapped. As the train passed over him, it hit his head and caused him to bleed profusely. However, the child was miraculously unhurt and was rescued by another man who had rushed to the spot after seeing the commotion. Khan was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors treated him for skull fractures and other injuries. He is currently in stable condition, but needs further medical care and financial support.
The incident has triggered a spontaneous outpouring of admiration and gratitude towards Khan, who has been hailed as a hero by many people, including politicians, celebrities, and ordinary citizens. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have been flooded with messages of support and calls for honoring Khan with awards and recognition. Several prominent individuals, including the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and the president of India, have praised Khan’s bravery and promised to extend help to him and his family.
However, the incident has also raised some important questions about the nature of heroism and the risks that ordinary people are willing to take to save others. Some critics have pointed out that while Khan’s actions were certainly courageous, they were also reckless and could have resulted in his death or serious disability. Moreover, they argue, the fact that Khan had to put his life in danger to save a child reflects the failure of the state and society to provide adequate security and infrastructure for the disadvantaged sections of the population, who often have to live in or near railway tracks due to lack of alternatives.
Others have countered these arguments by saying that Khan’s act was not only a gesture of bravery, but also a manifestation of empathy and solidarity towards the weaker and vulnerable members of the community. They argue that heroism should not be judged solely by the outcome, but also by the intention and the motivation behind it. If Khan had not acted, they say, the child’s life would have been lost or ruined, and the collective morale and dignity of the community would have suffered irreparably. By taking a stand, Khan has shown that even an ordinary person can become a hero in the face of adversity and injustice.
The incident of Hathras has thus opened up a new chapter in the ongoing discourse on heroism and civic responsibility in India, and has challenged the stereotypical notions of heroism that are based on physical prowess or external rewards. It has shown that heroism can arise from the most unexpected sources and can inspire others to act in similar ways. As the country faces numerous challenges, from the COVID-19 pandemic to social inequality and political polarization, the story of Javed Khan reminds us that there is still hope and courage in the midst of despair and turmoil. All it takes is a blow to the head and a heart full of compassion.
