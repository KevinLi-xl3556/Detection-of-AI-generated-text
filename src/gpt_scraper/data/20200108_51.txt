The Smithsonian Institution, one of the world’s most renowned research and cultural institutions, is partnering with a leading graphic novel publisher to bring American history to life in a new and exciting way. The institution, which manages 19 museums and galleries, as well as the National Zoo, has announced a collaboration with the independent graphic novel publisher, First Second Books, to create a series of graphic books on American history.
The series will be titled “The Smithsonian History of America” and will cover a wide range of topics, from the founding of the nation to contemporary American culture. The books will feature richly detailed illustrations and engaging storytelling, providing a unique and immersive way to learn about America’s past.
The partnership with First Second Books is a natural fit for the Smithsonian, which has a long history of using innovative methods to share knowledge and engage with the public. According to John Gray, the director of the National Museum of American History, “The Smithsonian has always been about finding new ways to engage with people and connect them with our nation’s history and culture. Graphic novels are a popular and powerful way to do just that, and we’re excited to partner with First Second to bring the Smithsonian’s expertise and collections to readers in a new and compelling way.”
First Second Books, which was founded in 2006, has quickly become a leader in the graphic novel industry, publishing award-winning titles that span genres and audiences. The publisher’s commitment to high-quality storytelling and illustration makes it an ideal partner for the Smithsonian’s project.
According to Mark Siegel, the editorial director of First Second Books, “We’re thrilled to be working with the Smithsonian on this project. We believe that graphic novels have the power to make history come alive for readers of all ages, and we’re excited to use our medium to help tell the story of America.”
The first book in “The Smithsonian History of America” series will be titled “The First Americans” and will explore the history and culture of Native American peoples. The book is set to be released in 2022, with subsequent volumes covering topics such as the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the space race.
The series represents a significant effort by the Smithsonian to engage with new audiences and promote an appreciation for American history and culture. By partnering with First Second Books, the institution is leveraging the power of graphic novels to create a dynamic and immersive learning experience that is accessible to readers of all ages.
As Gray notes, “The Smithsonian is committed to making our collections and expertise available to as many people as possible. By partnering with First Second Books, we’re able to reach a new audience and inspire a new generation of learners and thinkers. We can’t wait to see what stories and discoveries come from this exciting collaboration.”
