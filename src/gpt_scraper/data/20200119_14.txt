Rutgers to Name Its First Black President, School Official Says
Rutgers University, one of the oldest and largest public research institutions in the United States, is set to name its first-ever Black president. The historic appointment comes as the university has been grappling with issues of diversity and inclusion, in particular in the aftermath of nationwide protests against racial injustice.
According to a school official, the university’s Board of Governors is expected to announce the appointment of Dr. Jonathan Holloway as the next president of Rutgers. Dr. Holloway, who is currently serving as Northwestern University’s provost, will take over from Robert Barchi, who is set to retire at the end of July.
Dr. Holloway, who holds a Ph.D. in history from Yale University, has an extensive background in academia and has been a champion for diversity and inclusion throughout his career. He has written extensively on African American history, including a book on the slave trade’s impact on American history, and has been a vocal advocate for greater representation of people of color in higher education.
The appointment of Dr. Holloway comes at a time when Rutgers has been experiencing its own struggles with diversity and inclusion. In recent years, there have been protests on campus over racial disparities and the university’s handling of incidents of hate speech and bias.
In response, the university has launched a series of initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion, including the establishment of a task force to address issues of race and bias on campus. The appointment of a Black president is seen as a significant step forward in this ongoing effort.
Dr. Holloway’s appointment has been welcomed by students, faculty, and staff at Rutgers, who see it as a turning point in the university’s history. In a statement, the Rutgers University Student Assembly said, “We are excited for Dr. Holloway to bring his leadership and experience to our university, and we look forward to working with him to make our campus a more welcoming and inclusive place for all.”
The appointment of Rutgers’ first Black president is a significant milestone for the university and the wider higher education community in the United States. It represents a recognition of the need for greater diversity and inclusion in academia and a commitment to addressing the issues of racial injustice that have been at the forefront of national discourse over the past year.
As Dr. Holloway takes up his new role, he will undoubtedly face challenges, but there is optimism that he can lead Rutgers towards a more equitable and inclusive future. His appointment is a reminder that change is possible, and that institutions of higher learning can play a key role in advancing social justice and equity.
