Welcome to your Wednesday briefing, where we cover the top news stories from around the world. Today’s briefing will cover three major stories that have been making headlines: Iran, Impeachment, and Pope Benedict. Let’s dive in.
Iran:
Tensions have been rising between Iran and the United States in recent weeks. The US has accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, a charge which Iran denies. In response to the attacks, the US has announced that it will send 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East, citing concerns about the safety of American forces in the region.
Iran has also announced that it will break the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the 2015 nuclear deal. The move comes after the US withdrew from the deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran. European countries have been trying to salvage the deal, but it remains to be seen whether they will be successful.
Impeachment:
Calls for the impeachment of President Donald Trump have been growing louder in recent weeks. The move comes after the release of the Mueller report, which found that Russia had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election. While the report did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.
Many Democrats are now calling for impeachment proceedings to begin, arguing that Trump’s actions constitute a threat to the rule of law. However, some Democrats are wary of starting impeachment proceedings, arguing that it could backfire and help Trump win re-election in 2020.
Pope Benedict:
Pope Benedict XVI has broken his silence on the Catholic Church’s sex abuse scandal in a new essay. In the essay, Benedict blames the crisis on the sexual revolution of the 1960s, which he says led to a breakdown in moral values.
Benedict also criticizes what he calls the “dictatorship of relativism,” which he says has led to a rejection of traditional morality and the elevation of individual preferences over the common good. The essay has sparked controversy, with some accusing Benedict of deflecting blame from the Church’s hierarchy and failing to address the role of institutional factors in the crisis.
