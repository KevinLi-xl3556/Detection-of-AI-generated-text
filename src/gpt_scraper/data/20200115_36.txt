Robert Downey Jr.’s latest film, ‘Dolittle’, has received mixed reviews since its release in January 2020. However, after watching the film myself, I have to say that I fall firmly on the negative side of the spectrum. In fact, I would go so far as to say that ‘Dolittle’ is a complete disaster.
The film follows the titular character, Dr. John Dolittle (played by Downey Jr.), a veterinarian who can communicate with animals. After being holed up in his mansion for years following the death of his wife, Dolittle is recruited by a young boy named Tommy (Harry Collett) to help save the life of the Queen of England (Jessie Buckley), who has fallen gravely ill.
The film’s premise is solid, and the cast is impressive, with stars such as Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, and Octavia Spencer voicing the various animals that Dolittle encounters on his journey. However, despite these strengths, the film falls apart due to a number of issues.
First and foremost, the film’s humor falls flat. The jokes are juvenile and predictable, and the slapstick humor feels forced and uninspired. In fact, the film’s attempts at humor are so bad that they are almost cringe-worthy, leaving the audience feeling uncomfortable rather than entertained.
Additionally, the film suffers from a convoluted and messy plot. The storyline is difficult to follow, and the pacing is erratic, with the film jumping from one scene to the next without any sense of cohesion or flow. This lack of narrative structure makes it difficult for the audience to become invested in the characters or the story, and as a result, the film feels disjointed and unsatisfying.
Perhaps the most significant issue with ‘Dolittle’, however, is Robert Downey Jr.’s performance. While Downey Jr. is a talented actor, his portrayal of Dr. Dolittle is grating and unpleasant. His attempt at a Welsh accent is distracting and inconsistent, and his performance feels over-the-top and exaggerated. As a result, it’s difficult to connect with Dolittle as a character, and the film suffers as a result.
Overall, ‘Dolittle’ is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. Despite its impressive cast and solid premise, the film’s lackluster humor, messy plot, and problematic lead performance make it a forgettable and underwhelming experience. If you’re looking for a family-friendly film that will actually make you laugh, you’re better off looking elsewhere.
