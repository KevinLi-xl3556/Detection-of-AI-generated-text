Rural Montana Had Already Lost Too Many Native Women. Then Selena Disappeared.
There is a growing crisis in rural Montana that is causing fear and devastation amongst Native American communities. This crisis is the disappearance and murder of Native American women, and it is a crisis that has been ongoing for far too long. The small town of Lame Deer has been at the epicenter of this crisis for years, and the disappearance of Selena Not Afraid has only further highlighted the failings of authorities to address this issue.
The statistics are staggering. According to a report by the Urban Indian Health Institute, Montana has the highest rate of missing and murdered indigenous women in the United States. These women are often overlooked, with many cases not being reported or taken seriously by law enforcement agencies. The lack of attention paid to these cases has led to a growing epidemic of violence against Native American women.
The case of Selena Not Afraid is yet another example of this epidemic. Selena was a 16-year-old girl who disappeared on New Year’s Day, 2020. She was last seen at a rest area near Billings, Montana, and her body was found three weeks later in a mountainous area nearby. Her death was ruled accidental, but her family and community have raised serious concerns about the investigation and the handling of her case.
In an interview with NBC News, Selena’s aunt, Cheryl Horn, expressed frustration with the lack of response from law enforcement. “The FBI wasn’t called in until a week after she went missing,” she said. “We’re talking hours and minutes here, not days and weeks.”
This lack of urgency and attention to missing and murdered indigenous women is not unique to Selena’s case. The issue has been ongoing for years, with Native American women being disproportionately affected. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, but include factors such as systemic racism, poverty, and a lack of resources.
The crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women is not going away. It is a crisis that demands attention and action from both the government and society as a whole. Law enforcement agencies need to do better in addressing these cases and treating them with the attention and respect they deserve. Communities need to be empowered to come forward and report these cases without fear of retribution or neglect.
The disappearance of Selena Not Afraid is a tragic example of the ongoing crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. It is time for society to acknowledge and address this issue, and to work together towards a solution that ensures the safety and well-being of all Native American women.
