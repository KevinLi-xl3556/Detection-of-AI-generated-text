You’ve probably heard the phrase “kill them with kindness” before. It’s a common piece of advice that suggests being excessively nice to someone will eventually wear them down and make them more cooperative. However, the truth is that this approach doesn’t always work. In fact, in some cases, being too kind can actually be counterproductive. Instead, you may need to take a different approach altogether.
Firstly, let’s take a closer look at what it means to “kill them with kindness”. The phrase is often used to describe a situation where someone is being difficult or uncooperative, and the suggestion is to respond to their negativity with an abundance of positivity. This could involve being overly complimentary, overly forgiving, or simply showering them with kindness and attention.
The idea behind this approach is that if you are nice enough to someone, they will eventually see the error of their ways and become more cooperative. However, this is not always the case. In fact, in some cases, being overly nice can actually backfire and make the situation worse.
For example, imagine you are dealing with a difficult coworker who is constantly undermining you in front of your boss. You might be tempted to “kill them with kindness” by complimenting their work, offering to help them with tasks, and generally being as friendly as possible. However, this approach could actually make the situation worse, as it may give the coworker the impression that their behavior is acceptable and that they can continue to undermine you with no consequences.
Instead of being overly nice, you may need to take a different approach. This could involve setting clear boundaries and expectations, calling out the coworker’s behavior when it happens, and speaking to your boss or HR about the situation. While this approach may be more confrontational than “killing them with kindness”, it is ultimately more effective in creating change.
Of course, this is not to say that kindness has no place in conflict resolution. Kindness and empathy are important tools in building positive relationships and resolving conflicts. However, it’s important to recognize that kindness alone is not always enough, and that sometimes more assertive actions are necessary to create change.
In conclusion, the idea of “killing them with kindness” is a well-intentioned but ultimately flawed approach to conflict resolution. While kindness and empathy are important tools in building positive relationships, they are not always enough to create change. Instead, it may be necessary to take a more assertive approach in certain situations, such as setting clear boundaries and expectations, calling out negative behavior, and seeking support from others. By taking a more balanced approach to conflict resolution, you can create positive change while also maintaining your own boundaries and self-respect.
