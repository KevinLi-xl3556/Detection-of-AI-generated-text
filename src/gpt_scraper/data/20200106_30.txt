In the world of theater, social media has become an increasingly important tool for promoting shows and engaging with fans. And no show has leveraged the power of Twitter quite like “The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical.”
This Tony Award-winning production, based on the popular young adult book series by Rick Riordan, has been able to build a massive following on Twitter, thanks in large part to its witty, irreverent, and highly interactive social media presence.
But what exactly goes on behind the “Lightning Thief” Twitter curtain? How has this production been able to use Twitter to connect with fans and build a loyal following?
To find out, we spoke with some of the people behind the show’s social media accounts, including the show’s social media manager, assistant director, and even some of the actors themselves.
According to social media manager Samantha Klasfeld, the key to the show’s success on Twitter has been its ability to strike the right balance between humor and heart. “We never want to make fun of the fans or the source material,” she says. “But we also don’t take ourselves too seriously. We try to be playful and irreverent, while also showing a deep respect for the world that Rick Riordan created.”
One of the ways the “Lightning Thief” Twitter account has been able to connect with fans is by using a combination of in-jokes and references that only fans of the books will understand, along with broader pop culture references that appeal to a wider audience. For example, the account has referenced everything from “Hamilton” to “The Office” to “Bridgerton,” all while staying true to the show’s unique voice and sensibility.
But the show’s Twitter account isn’t just about jokes and memes. It’s also a powerful tool for engaging with fans and building a sense of community. The account regularly retweets and responds to fans, and even holds regular “Twitter takeovers” where members of the cast and crew will take over the account for a day to interact with fans and share behind-the-scenes content.
According to assistant director Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, this level of fan engagement has been crucial to the show’s success. “We want fans to feel like they’re part of the ‘Lightning Thief’ family,” he says. “We want them to feel like they have a stake in the show’s success, and that they’re part of something special.”
Of course, none of this would matter if the show itself wasn’t any good. But luckily, “The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical” is a bona fide hit, with catchy songs, energetic performances, and a genuinely moving story about a boy trying to find his place in the world.
And while social media can’t make a bad show good, it can certainly help a good show find its audience. And in the case of “The Lightning Thief,” Twitter has been a key part of the show’s success, helping it build a massive fanbase and earn a Tony Award for Best Musical.
So the next time you’re scrolling through Twitter and come across a witty, irreverent tweet from the “Lightning Thief” account, remember that there’s a whole team of people behind the scenes working hard to make that magic happen. And if you’re a fan of the show, consider joining the conversation and becoming part of the “Lightning Thief” family.
