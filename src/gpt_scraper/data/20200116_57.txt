Did ‘Marriage Story’ Hit Close to Home? Tell Us Your Story
If you have watched the movie ‘Marriage Story’ on Netflix, you might have felt a range of emotions: empathy, sorrow, anger, confusion, or even relief. This acclaimed drama, written and directed by Noah Baumbach and starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, depicts the painful process of a couple’s divorce and the impact on their family, friends, and selves. While some viewers praised the film for its realistic and nuanced portrayal of marriage and separation, others found it too bleak, biased, or triggering. However, regardless of your opinion on the film’s artistic merits, you might have found it resonant or relevant to your own life.
That’s why we invite you to share your story. We want to hear from real people who have gone through a divorce or a separation, or have witnessed one, and have reflections, insights, or lessons to share. Your story can be similar or different from the one in ‘Marriage Story’, but it should be authentic and respectful. We value diverse perspectives and experiences, and we aim to create a safe and supportive space for you to express yourself.
To start the conversation, here are some questions you might want to consider:

How did you feel when you watched ‘Marriage Story’? Did it trigger any memories or emotions?
What aspects of the film resonated with you or challenged you? Were there any scenes, lines, or characters that stood out to you?
What was your own experience of marriage or serious relationship? How did it end, and how did you cope with the aftermath?
What did you learn about yourself, your partner, or relationships in general, from your separation process? How did you grow or change as a result?
What advice or support would you give to someone who is going through a divorce or separation, based on your own experience?

You can write your story in any form you prefer: as a personal essay, a fictionalized account, a poem, a letter, or anything else. You can also choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym.
To submit your story, please send an email to our editor at [insert email address], with the subject line ‘Marriage Story Submission’. Please include a brief bio (optional), a title for your story, and a word count (up to 1000 words). We will review your story carefully and contact you within two weeks to confirm the publication.
We believe that sharing stories can be a powerful way to connect, heal, and inspire. Thank you for considering to contribute to our project. We hope to hear from you soon.
