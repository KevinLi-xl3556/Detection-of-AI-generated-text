Smiling is an essential part of our communication with others. It helps us convey positive emotions and build connections. Studies have shown that people with attractive smiles are generally perceived as happier, more successful, and more approachable. However, not everyone is fortunate enough to have a perfect smile. Crooked or misaligned teeth can cause self-consciousness and even affect a person’s confidence in social situations. That’s where dental companies come into play, promising to improve your smile and boost your self-esteem. But what happens when their promises fall short, and your smile still isn’t up to par?
One company has a unique solution to deal with unhappy customers- they shush them. Yes, you read that right. This dental company has included a clause in their contract that allows them to silence dissatisfied customers if they complain about their dental work publically. This clause has caused an uproar in the dental community, with many people questioning its authenticity and morality.
The company claims that shushing disgruntled customers is a reasonable policy as it protects their business’s reputation. They argue that negative reviews can harm their reputation and affect their bottom line. However, many people are not convinced and believe that this policy is an infringement on their freedom of speech.
After all, doesn’t everyone have the right to express their opinions and experiences? Particularly, when it comes to their dental health and well-being. The idea of a company being able to silence negative feedback is concerning, as it could lead to shoddy work and poor customer service.
Moreover, this policy could lead to a lack of accountability in the company. Things could quickly spiral out of control with no one to hold the company responsible for any mistakes or substandard work they do. In the past, the dental industry has been plagued by scandals where patients have suffered because of negligence or incompetence. Allowing companies to silence complaints could make it easier for such incidents to occur.
At the end of the day, dental companies have a responsibility to provide high-quality work and customer service. They should be open to feedback, both positive and negative, and use it to improve their business. This clause that allows companies to shush complaining customers is not only unethical, but it’s also counterproductive. It may prevent negative reviews, but it won’t fix the underlying problem or help the company grow.
In conclusion, while we all want a perfect smile, it’s important to remember to choose a dental company that has a track record of excellence and customer satisfaction. It’s also important to be aware of any clauses in the contract that could limit your freedom of expression. You should be able to speak your truth and hold any company that offers dental services accountable for their work. Remember, a company that values its customers will always strive for excellence and openness.
