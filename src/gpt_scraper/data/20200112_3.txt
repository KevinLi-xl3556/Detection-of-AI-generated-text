The legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, is one that continues to be celebrated and studied by many Americans. During his tenure, he implemented a wide range of policies and programs that transformed the country, including the New Deal, Social Security, and the GI Bill. His leadership during World War II also helped to solidify his place in history as one of America’s greatest presidents. However, despite his enduring popularity, it seems that many modern-day Democrats have lost touch with the principles and policies that F.D.R. championed.
One of the most notable examples of this disconnect is the current debate around healthcare in the United States. Roosevelt was a strong advocate for expanding access to healthcare and believed that it was a fundamental human right. In fact, he proposed a national health insurance program as part of his New Deal reforms, but it was ultimately struck down by Congress. Today, many Democrats are pushing for a similar system, commonly referred to as “Medicare for All.” However, the proposal has faced significant opposition from within the party, with some arguing that it is too expensive or politically unfeasible.
Another area where Democrats seem to have lost touch with F.D.R.'s legacy is in their approach to economic policy. Roosevelt believed that the government had a responsibility to ensure that all Americans had access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. He implemented a wide range of programs to achieve this goal, including the Works Progress Administration, which employed millions of Americans during the Great Depression, and the Rural Electrification Administration, which brought electricity to rural areas. Today, many Democrats are pushing for policies like a higher minimum wage and universal basic income, but these proposals have faced criticism from within the party.
Perhaps the most significant area where Democrats have departed from F.D.R.'s legacy is in their approach to foreign policy. Roosevelt believed that the United States had a responsibility to lead the world in promoting peace and democracy. He played a key role in the establishment of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods system, which helped to rebuild Europe after World War II. Today, many Democrats are advocating for a more isolationist approach to foreign policy, with some even calling for a withdrawal from global institutions like NATO.
There are, of course, many Democrats who still believe in the principles and policies that F.D.R. championed. However, it seems that the party as a whole has lost touch with its roots in recent years. The reasons for this are complex, but it is clear that the Democratic Party needs to reconnect with its historical legacy if it wants to remain a relevant force in American politics. Whether it is through policies like Medicare for All, a higher minimum wage, or a renewed commitment to global leadership, Democrats must embrace the vision that F.D.R. articulated so clearly and effectively over 80 years ago.
