In a move to protect vulnerable Americans, a coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed a lawsuit to block President Trump’s proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, claims that the Trump administration’s proposed rule change that would limit states’ ability to waive work requirements for SNAP recipients is unlawful and will cause irreparable harm to millions of Americans who rely on the program for their basic needs.
Under current regulations, states can seek waivers from the work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents in areas with high unemployment rates or insufficient job opportunities. The new rule would limit these waivers to areas with unemployment rates above 7%, which attorneys general argue will unfairly impact low-income individuals and harm the economy in these areas.
The lawsuit was led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and joined by attorneys general from 13 other states, including California, Connecticut, and Michigan. In a statement, James argued that the proposed rule change would exacerbate food insecurity in already struggling communities.
“This rule is un-American, illogical, and cruel,” James said. “The Trump Administration is trampling on states’ rights and attempting to strip food assistance from our most vulnerable neighbors.”
Food insecurity is a significant issue in the United States, with approximately 37 million Americans receiving SNAP benefits in 2018. Studies have shown that access to these benefits can improve health outcomes and reduce poverty rates, particularly among children.
The attorneys general argue that the proposed rule change is not only unlawful but also runs contrary to the purpose of the SNAP program. “Congress created SNAP to help Americans access food when they’re in need, not to create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles or punish people for being poor,” said Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.
The lawsuit is just one of several legal challenges against the Trump administration’s proposed SNAP cuts, which are set to take effect on April 1, 2020. In addition to the attorney’s general lawsuit, several advocacy groups have also filed lawsuits against the rule change.
As the legal battles continue, many Americans are left wondering what will happen to their food stamp benefits. With so many vulnerable families already struggling to make ends meet, it’s clear that any cuts to the SNAP program will have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans.
