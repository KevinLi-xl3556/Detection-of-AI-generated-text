In a surprising move, a local New Hampshire union has endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president, despite the fact that their national affiliate has not yet made an endorsement. The decision by the union, which represents workers in a variety of industries across the state, is seen as a significant boost to Sanders’ campaign in the crucial early primary state.
The New Hampshire branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) made the endorsement on Monday, following a vote by the union’s executive board. The decision was made without waiting for the national union’s endorsement, which is expected to come later in the primary season.
The move represents a break with tradition for the union, which typically follows the lead of its national affiliate in endorsing candidates for political office. However, union leaders in New Hampshire say they were motivated to act independently by Sanders’ strong track record on issues important to their members.
“Bernie Sanders has been a champion for working people throughout his career,” said IAMAW Local 822 President Rachel Jardin in a statement. “He has consistently fought for fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize. We believe he is the best candidate to represent the interests of our members in the White House.”
Sanders has long been a favorite of organized labor, thanks to his advocacy for policies such as a $15 minimum wage, universal healthcare, and the expansion of workers’ rights. He has also been endorsed by several other unions, including the National Nurses United, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, and the American Postal Workers Union.
The endorsement from IAMAW Local 822 is particularly significant, however, given the importance of New Hampshire in the presidential primary process. The state is the site of the first primary election in the nation, and has a long history of playing a key role in shaping the outcome of presidential races.
Sanders won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, and is expected to be a strong contender in the state once again in 2020. However, he faces stiff competition from a crowded field of Democratic candidates, many of whom are also vying for the support of organized labor.
Despite this competition, Sanders’ campaign has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, with a series of high-profile endorsements and a surge in fundraising. The endorsement from IAMAW Local 822 is sure to give him a boost, both in New Hampshire and across the country.
The decision by the New Hampshire union to back Sanders also highlights the growing rift between the national labor movement and the Democratic Party establishment. Many unions have been frustrated with the party’s failure to fully embrace the labor movement’s agenda, and have been seeking out alternative candidates who are more closely aligned with their interests.
Whether this trend will continue in the coming months remains to be seen. But for now, Bernie Sanders can count on the support of at least one local union in New Hampshire, as he continues his bid for the presidency.
