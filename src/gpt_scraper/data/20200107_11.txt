Pompeo Upended Middle East by Pushing Trump to Kill Iranian General
On January 3rd, 2020, a drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, while he was in Baghdad, Iraq. This sudden turn of events sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East and the world. Many wondered what led the US President to authorize such an act, and it wasn’t long before the role of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was exposed.
Pompeo, a former Army officer and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had been pushing for a more aggressive stance towards Iran for some time. He reportedly convinced Trump of the necessity to take out Soleimani, citing the Iranian General’s role in destabilizing the region and the threat he posed to US interests.
Soleimani was considered a hero by many Iranians for his role in directing Iran’s military strategy in the region. He was deemed responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, including US soldiers, and was highly respected by Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The decision to kill Soleimani has created a major shift in the balance of power in the Middle East. Iran responded with missile attacks against US military bases in Iraq, leading to fears of a wider conflict between the two nations. In addition, Iraq, a country already plagued by political instability, faced greater tensions as many Iraqis considered the US actions as a violation of their sovereignty.
Moreover, the killing of Soleimani has complicated efforts to tackle ISIS in the region. With Iranian support, Iraqi forces have been successful in their fight against the terrorist group, and the US military had been cooperating with them. Now, with increased anti-American sentiments, it may be more difficult for US forces to work with their Iraqi counterparts.
Many international leaders, including the European Union and Russia, have spoken out against Soleimani’s killing, warning of the potential for further escalation of violence in the region. Trump administration officials, including Pompeo, have defended the decision, arguing that it was necessary to protect US interests.
While Pompeo may have believed that he was taking a necessary step in protecting American interests in the Middle East, his actions have upended the region and created greater tensions between the US and Iran. It remains to be seen what the long-term impact of this decision will be, but it is clear that Pompeo played a significant role in pushing Trump towards this controversial move.
