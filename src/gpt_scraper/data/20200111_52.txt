As the world slowly emerges from the pandemic, many people are itching to travel again. While travel may not look exactly the same as it did before COVID-19, there are still plenty of opportunities to experience little tastes of normalcy while exploring the world. In fact, these small moments of familiarity can make a big difference in how enjoyable and fulfilling your trip is.
Whether you’re planning a long-term backpacking adventure or just a short getaway, here are some little tastes of normalcy to look out for on your trip around the world:

Your favorite foods

Food is one of the best ways to connect with a culture, but it can also be a source of comfort when you’re feeling homesick. Luckily, many popular American chains have international locations, so you can still grab a burger or a Starbucks latte when you need a taste of home. And even if you’re not into fast food, you’re bound to find some comfort foods from your own culture at local restaurants around the world.

Familiar entertainment

While you’re on the road, it’s nice to take a break from exploring and kick back with some familiar entertainment. If you’re a sports fan, find a local bar showing a game from your home country. If you’re into movies or TV shows, look for theaters or streaming services that carry English-language content. And if you’re a gamer, consider bringing your console or handheld device along with you for some downtime entertainment.

Everyday routines

Even when you’re traveling, it’s important to maintain some sense of routine to feel grounded. Whether it’s going for a morning run, doing yoga in your hotel room, or finding a local gym to work out in, sticking to some of your normal habits can help you feel more at home. Plus, these routines can also provide a great way to explore a new city or neighborhood.

Connections with loved ones

Thanks to technology, it’s easier than ever to stay connected with friends and family back home. Schedule regular video chats or phone calls to catch up on each other’s lives and share your travel experiences. And if you’re feeling really homesick, consider sending some postcards or care packages to loved ones - not only will it make them feel special, but it can also give you a sense of connection and purpose.

Cultural similarities

While it’s important to embrace and appreciate cultural differences when traveling, it can also be comforting to discover similarities between your own culture and others. Whether it’s a shared love of music, fashion, or art, finding common ground with locals can help you feel more at ease and connected to the place you’re visiting.
In conclusion, while travel may not be exactly the same as it was before the pandemic, there are still plenty of opportunities to experience little tastes of normalcy while exploring the world. Whether it’s finding your favorite foods, connecting with loved ones, or sticking to familiar routines, these small moments of familiarity can make a big difference in how enjoyable and fulfilling your trip is. So embrace the differences, but also cherish the similarities - they might just help you feel more at home in a foreign place.
