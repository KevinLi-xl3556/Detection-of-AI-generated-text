The Oscars are one of the most prestigious award ceremonies in the entertainment industry. Each year, the nominations are eagerly awaited by fans, film lovers, and industry professionals alike. However, the 2021 Oscar season has raised many questions about the validity and impartiality of the nominations process.
One of the most significant issues surrounding the 2021 Oscars is the lack of diversity among the nominees. While the Academy made some efforts to diversify its membership in recent years, the result of this year’s nominations shows that there is still a long way to go. The majority of nominees are white, male, and from privileged backgrounds.
What’s even more troubling is that most of the criticism and backlash against the lack of diversity in the nominations has come from white male critics and award hosts. These voices have been outspoken in their condemnation of the Academy’s lack of diversity, yet they are part of the systemic problem themselves.
For example, Stephen Colbert, the well-known white male host of “The Late Show,” criticized the lack of diversity in this year’s nominations. He pointed out that there were no people of color nominated in the acting categories and that the only female nominated for Best Director was Chloé Zhao. However, his show has had only five female directors out of the 440 episodes aired, and only 5.5 % of the guests were of Asian or Pacific Islander descent, according to data by Variety.
Another example is Bill Maher, who criticized the nominations for their lack of diversity but then went on to insult Asians in a recent episode of his show. Maher, like many other white male hosts, has a history of insensitive jokes and discriminatory behavior on his show.
It’s not just the hosts; many of the critics and journalists who cover the Oscars and film industry are also white and male. These individuals are responsible for shaping public opinion about the nominees, and their voices carry a lot of weight. When white male critics and hosts condemn the lack of diversity, they are perpetuating the same system that they are criticizing.
To bridge the diversity gap, it’s essential to elevate the voices and experiences of people from all backgrounds. Diverse individuals need to be included in the decision-making process, from the Academy to the film studios and media outlets. This will ensure that a more diverse group of artists and films are considered for nominations.
In conclusion, the lack of diversity among the 2021 Oscar nominations has rightly drawn criticism from industry professionals and fans alike. However, it’s important to note that the critiques are coming mostly from white male hosts and critics who are part of the problem. It’s only by elevating diverse voices and experiences that we can truly start to address the systemic barriers that have prevented greater inclusivity in the entertainment industry.
