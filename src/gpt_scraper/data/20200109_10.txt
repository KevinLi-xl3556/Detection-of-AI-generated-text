Kansas has long resisted expanding Medicaid, leaving many of its most vulnerable residents without access to healthcare. But, thanks to a recent breakthrough, that may be about to change.
For years, activists and healthcare professionals have been pushing for Medicaid expansion in Kansas. The state is one of only twelve in the country that has yet to take advantage of this aspect of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, around 150,000 low-income Kansans have been unable to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Many have been forced to rely on expensive emergency room visits or simply go without healthcare altogether.
Initially, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly proposed Medicaid expansion in her first budget request in 2019. However, Republican leaders in the state Senate blocked the measure from coming to a vote, citing concerns about the cost to taxpayers.
But earlier this year, a new alliance emerged. A group of moderate Republicans joined forces with Democrats to push for Medicaid expansion once again. The coalition demonstrated the growing popularity of the idea, as well as the impact it could have on Kansansâ€™ lives.
To finally push through their proposal, the coalition was forced to make some concessions. For example, the expansion will only cover adults earning up to 138% of the poverty level. Additionally, the plan includes certain personal responsibility provisions, like requiring job training or volunteer work for some beneficiaries.
While these changes may prove beneficial in getting the proposal passed, some advocates worry that they could weaken the ultimate impact of the expansion. For instance, job training requirements could prove difficult to enforce, and could cause some eligible Kansans to fall through the cracks.
Despite these concerns, the coalition has remained committed to pushing the proposal forward. They believe that expanding Medicaid is vital to ensuring that all Kansans have access to the healthcare they need.
The proposal has now passed the state Senate and has moved on to the House. If it is approved, Kansas will finally join the ranks of the thirty-eight other states that have already expanded Medicaid coverage. This would be a monumental step forward for the state and could improve the lives of thousands of Kansans.
Certainly, there are challenges ahead. But the fact that the proposal is finally moving forward represents a major victory for those who have been fighting for expanded healthcare access in Kansas. When Medicaid expansion was once considered a pipe dream, it may now become a reality.
