“Underwater” Review: Wobbly Sea Legs
The ocean is a mysterious and daunting place, full of unexplored depths and untold wonders. The 2020 film “Underwater” seeks to tap into this intrigue, taking audiences on a terrifying journey to the bottom of the sea. Starring Kristen Stewart and directed by William Eubank, the film has generated a fair amount of buzz since its release. But does it live up to the hype? In this review, we’ll take a closer look.
The film centers on a group of researchers working on a deep-sea drilling rig. When the rig is damaged in an earthquake, the crew must navigate their way to safety while being pursued by mysterious creatures that have been awakened from the depths. Stewart plays Norah, a mechanical engineer who finds herself thrust into a leadership role as the situation grows increasingly dire.
On the surface, “Underwater” has all the makings of a great thriller. The underwater setting is both claustrophobic and awe-inspiring, and the premise of being hunted by unknown creatures is inherently tense. And yet, the film never quite finds its footing. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition followed by sudden bursts of action that feel disjointed. The characters are thinly drawn, with little to distinguish them beyond their job titles (Captain! Biologist! Comedian!). Even Stewart, who has proven herself to be a compelling performer in other roles, is given little to work with here beyond stoic determination.
The creatures themselves are suitably terrifying, with a design that is both grotesque and fascinating. But they’re also underutilized, relegated to brief glimpses and shadowy shots that fail to capitalize on their potential. There’s a sense that the filmmakers were relying on the creatures’ appearance to do the heavy lifting in terms of scares, rather than crafting a story that truly builds tension and suspense.
That’s not to say that “Underwater” is a complete failure. The film has a handful of effective moments, particularly in its more action-packed sequences. And the production design is top-notch, creating a believable world of pipes and metal that feels appropriately claustrophobic. But ultimately, the film never quite manages to pull all its elements together into a cohesive whole. It’s a movie that wants to be both a survival horror story and a contemplative meditation on humanity’s relationship to the ocean, but it never fully commits to either.
In the end, “Underwater” is a film with wobbly sea legs. It has a strong concept and some effective scares, but it never quite manages to deliver the full package. Fans of creature features and survival horror may find enough to enjoy here, but for most viewers, the film will likely leave them feeling underwhelmed.
