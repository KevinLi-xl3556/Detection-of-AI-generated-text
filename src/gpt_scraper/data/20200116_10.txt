Impeachment, Ukraine, Christopher Tolkien: Your Thursday Evening Briefing
Welcome to Thursday’s evening briefing. Today we’ll be discussing the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, the ongoing situation in Ukraine, and the recent passing of Christopher Tolkien.
Impeachment Inquiry: The Impeachment inquiry continues to gain steam with the recent release of text messages between top US diplomats discussing withholding military aid to Ukraine in exchange for political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. The House has issued subpoenas for documents and testimony from top officials in the Trump administration, and witnesses have already begun to testify behind closed doors. The President has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation is quickly becoming a major political headache for the administration.
Ukraine: In Ukraine, a tenuous ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists was shattered yesterday with a flurry of artillery fire. The renewed fighting has left several soldiers dead and underlines the fragile nature of the conflict in the region. Ukraine is also at the center of the impeachment inquiry in Washington, with President Trump accused of pressuring the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden and his son.
Christopher Tolkien: Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s work were saddened to learn of the passing of his son Christopher Tolkien earlier this week. Christopher was tasked with editing and publishing his father’s unfinished works and was responsible for bringing beloved works like The Silmarillion to audiences worldwide. His passing marks the end of an era for fans of the Tolkien universe.
That concludes today’s Thursday evening briefing. Join us tomorrow for the latest news and analysis.
