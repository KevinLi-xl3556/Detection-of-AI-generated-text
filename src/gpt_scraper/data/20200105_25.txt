On January 5th, 2020, the 77th Golden Globe Awards were held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. The awards show, which honors the best of film and television from the past year, was hosted by comedian Ricky Gervais and featured a star-studded audience. Among the big winners of the night were Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and Sam Mendes’ “1917”.
“Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, marking Tarantino’s third win in the category following “Pulp Fiction” and “Inglourious Basterds”. The film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, takes place in 1969 Los Angeles during the Manson Family murders and has been praised for its performances, cinematography, and nostalgic recreations of the era.
“1917”, on the other hand, won Best Motion Picture – Drama, as well as Best Director for Mendes. The film, which follows two British soldiers during World War I as they try to deliver a message that could save thousands of lives, was shot to look like one continuous take and has been lauded for its immersive and intense storytelling.
Other notable winners of the night included Joaquin Phoenix for Best Actor in a Drama for his role in “Joker”, Renée Zellweger for Best Actress in a Drama for her portrayal of Judy Garland in “Judy”, and Awkwafina for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for “The Farewell”.
The awards show was not without controversy, however. During his opening monologue, Gervais took shots at Hollywood elites and their activism, leading to mixed reactions from the audience and viewers at home. Additionally, the lack of diversity among the nominees and winners was a point of criticism, with only one person of color taking home an acting award (Ramy Youssef for “Ramy”).
Overall, the 77th Golden Globe Awards celebrated another year of exceptional film and television. As the precursor to the Academy Awards, the show sets the stage for the rest of awards season and provides a glimpse into which films and performances may be recognized down the road. With “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “1917” leading the pack, it will be interesting to see how the rest of awards season unfolds.
