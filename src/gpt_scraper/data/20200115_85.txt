When considering purchasing a home, the price is often a significant factor in the decision-making process. However, with a budget of $400,000, there are many options available in states such as Indiana, Massachusetts, and Arkansas.
In Indiana, $400,000 can fetch a spacious and modern home in the suburbs. For instance, in Fishers, a town located just outside of Indianapolis, a 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom single-family residence with a three-car garage is currently on the market for $399,999. The home spans 4,757 square feet and includes amenities such as a large kitchen, a basement, and a backyard with a fire pit and gazebo.
Moving east to Massachusetts, $400,000 may not seem like a lot in some of the state’s more upscale cities and towns. However, one can still find quality homes in areas outside of Boston. In Worcester, a city located approximately an hour away from Boston, a recently-built 4-bedroom colonial-style home is currently listed for $399,900. The property includes an open floor plan, stainless steel appliances, and a master suite with a walk-in closet.
Finally, heading down south to Arkansas, $400,000 can afford a luxurious home on a large piece of land. In Little Rock, the state’s capital city, a 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom home spanning over 3,400 square feet is currently on the market for $389,900. The property is situated on 2.5 acres of land and includes a chef’s kitchen, a covered back porch, and a bonus room.
While the prices of homes can vary significantly depending on the location and local housing market, a budget of $400,000 can still afford a comfortable and impressive residence in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Arkansas. The important thing is to research and compare options to find the best fit for one’s lifestyle and needs.
