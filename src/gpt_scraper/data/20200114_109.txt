Trump Likes Farmers Better Than Some Other Welfare Recipients
President Donald Trump has often claimed to be a friend of farmers, pledging to protect and promote their interests against what he calls unfair trade practices and excessive regulations. In his speeches and tweets, Trump has frequently praised farmers as hardworking, patriotic, and essential to the nation’s economy and security. However, critics note that Trump’s support for farmers often comes at the expense of other groups that rely on government assistance, such as low-income families, disabled people, and refugees.
One of the most visible examples of Trump’s favoritism towards farmers is his administration’s handling of the trade war with China, which has hit the agricultural sector particularly hard. As part of his strategy to reduce the US trade deficit with China and address intellectual property violations, Trump has imposed tariffs on a range of Chinese goods, including soybeans, pork, and dairy products. In response, China has retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on US agricultural exports, causing a sharp decline in demand and prices for crops and livestock.
To mitigate the effects of the trade war on farmers, Trump has authorized billions of dollars in federal aid to support them, through programs such as the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) and the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). Under these programs, farmers can apply for direct payments based on their production history and income, which are meant to offset the losses from the trade disruptions and Covid-19 pandemic. So far, the MFP has distributed over $23 billion in payments since 2018, and the CFAP has provided over $10 billion in aid this year.
However, some critics argue that the farm subsidies are unfair and inefficient, as they mostly benefit large agribusinesses and wealthy landowners, rather than small-scale or minority farmers who face systemic barriers to entry and discrimination. They also point out that the subsidies distort the agricultural market, encourage overproduction, and harm the environment by promoting monoculture and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. Moreover, they contend that the subsidies divert public resources away from other social programs, such as food stamps, housing assistance, or healthcare, that serve a broader and more vulnerable population.
Trump’s preference for farmers over other welfare recipients is also evident in his proposed budget cuts and policy changes. For instance, Trump’s budget proposals for 2018 and 2019 included significant reductions in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which provides nutrition assistance to over 40 million low-income Americans, including many children, seniors, and disabled individuals. Trump argued that the cuts were necessary to promote self-sufficiency and deter fraud and abuse, but critics saw them as an attack on the poor and vulnerable.
Similarly, Trump’s administration has made it harder for disabled people to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), by tightening the eligibility criteria, increasing the paperwork requirements, and reducing the funding for the administrative processes. This has led to longer waiting times, higher denial rates, and more appeals and hearings, which have put a strain on the already strained SSDI and SSI systems. Trump has claimed that the changes are meant to save taxpayer money and prevent fraud and abuse, but disability advocates have accused him of scapegoating and stigmatizing disabled people.
In conclusion, Trump’s support for farmers is not necessarily a sign of his benevolence or competence, but rather a reflection of his political priorities and biases. While farmers undoubtedly face challenges and deserve some form of assistance, providing them with preferential treatment at the expense of other groups is neither fair nor effective in the long term. Instead of pitting different segments of the population against each other, Trump and his successors should aim to build a more inclusive and equitable society that values and supports all its members, regardless of their occupation or income.
