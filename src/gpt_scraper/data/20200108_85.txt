Iranian Blood Is on Our Hands, Too
The recent assassination of Iran’s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, near Tehran, allegedly by Israeli agents, has renewed tensions between Iran and its adversaries, and raised concerns about the prospect of a wider conflict in the Middle East. While the responsibility for this act of violence lies with the perpetrators and their sponsors, we cannot ignore our own complicity in the suffering of the Iranian people, whose blood is on our hands, too.
Iran is a country of more than 80 million people, with a rich history and culture, and a complex political landscape. It is also a country that has been subjected to various forms of external pressure, from economic sanctions to military threats, and internal repression, from corruption to human rights abuses. The reasons for this are multiple and contested, but one factor that is often overlooked is the role of our own governments and societies in shaping the fate of Iran and its people.
Historically, Iran has been a victim of imperial powers, from the British and Russian empires in the 19th century to the American and Israeli hegemony in the 20th and 21st centuries. The CIA-backed coup that overthrew Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mossadegh in 1953, and installed the Shah as a dictator, was a turning point in Iran’s modern history, and set the stage for the Islamic revolution of 1979 that ousted the Shah and established the Islamic Republic.
Since then, Iran has been a thorn in the side of the US and its allies, who have sought to contain its influence and limit its access to nuclear technology. While Iran has repeatedly denied any intention to build nuclear weapons, and has complied with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that was signed in 2015 with the US, Russia, China, France, Germany, and the UK, the US unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran, under the pretext of curbing its “malign activities” in the region.
These sanctions have had a devastating impact on the Iranian economy, and on the well-being of ordinary Iranians, who have faced shortages of medicine, food, and other basic necessities, as well as inflation, unemployment, and corruption. While the US has claimed that the sanctions target only the Iranian regime and its alleged supporters, the reality is that they affect the entire Iranian society, and undermine the prospects of democratic change and peaceful cooperation.
Moreover, the US and its allies have not only imposed economic sanctions on Iran, but also supported armed groups and governments that have committed atrocities against Iranians, such as the Saddam Hussein regime during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, or the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen today. These interventions have not only caused direct harm to Iranian civilians, but also fueled anti-Western sentiment and extremism in the region.
Therefore, when we condemn the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, or any other act of violence against Iranians, we must also acknowledge our own responsibility for the suffering of the Iranian people. We must recognize that the root causes of the conflicts and tensions in the Middle East are not just local, but also global, and that they require a comprehensive and just approach that addresses the grievances and aspirations of all parties involved.
This approach should include a renewed commitment to multilateralism, diplomacy, and dialogue, based on respect for sovereignty, human rights, and non-interference. It should also involve a recognition of the diversity and complexity of the Middle East, and a rejection of simplistic and binary narratives that demonize or idealize any group or country. And it should prioritize the well-being and security of all people in the region,
