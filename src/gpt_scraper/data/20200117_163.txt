After Losing My Sight, Struggling to Be Seen
It was a normal day in my life when I woke up to realize I couldn’t see anything. I was terrified, and I thought it was a temporary condition. However, after countless visits to the hospital, I realized that I had lost my sight permanently.
The world I knew changed in a matter of moments. Colors, shapes, and light that I once took for granted were no longer visible to me. The sense of independence that sight provided me was gone, and I felt helpless.
At first, my family and friends were supportive, and I appreciated their help. However, I quickly realized that some people felt awkward around me because they didn’t know how to handle the situation. Others felt that since I couldn’t see, it was useless to communicate with me. As a result, I felt isolated and misunderstood.
I found myself struggling to be seen, not just as a person with a disability, but as a person with hopes, fears, and dreams like everyone else. People often treated me as someone who is broken and in need of pity, rather than as an equal member of society. The invisibility and lack of empathy left me feeling that I was no longer part of this world.
I realized that my experience was not unique. I had heard of similar stories from other visually impaired individuals who felt the same way. Many felt that society had stopped seeing them as people and started viewing them as their disability.
As time went on, I learned to cope with my new reality. I adapted to new techniques of living and communicated better with people around me. However, the struggle to be seen as an individual continues to this day.
Today, I ask society to be more empathetic and inclusive towards individuals with disabilities. I want people to acknowledge and recognize that people with disabilities are not different; rather, they require different accommodations to function as ordinary citizens. We all have a unique set of challenges, and disabilities should not impact how individuals are treated.
In conclusion, the journey of losing my sight has been a lifelong challenge. However, the real challenge was trying to be seen as a person, not just as a visually impaired individual. I hope that my story will inspire society to be more inclusive and accommodating towards individuals with disabilities, rather than making them feel like outsiders. Every person, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, deserves to be seen, heard, and valued in society.
