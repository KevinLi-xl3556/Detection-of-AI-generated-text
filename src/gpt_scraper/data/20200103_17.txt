The Golden Globes is one of the most eagerly awaited award shows of the year, celebrating the best in film and television. This year, the ceremony is set to take place on Sunday, and if you’re wondering how you can watch it, you’ve come to the right place.
There are a few ways to tune into the Golden Globes, depending on where you are and what devices you have at your disposal. Here’s a rundown of the different options:


Watch on TV
If you have a cable or satellite TV subscription, you can watch the Golden Globes on NBC. The ceremony is set to start at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on Sunday, and will be broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. Check your local listings to find out what channel NBC is on in your area.


Stream online
If you don’t have cable or satellite TV, you can still watch the Golden Globes online. NBC will be streaming the ceremony live on its website, NBC.com, as well as on its app, which you can download for free from the App Store or Google Play. Note that you’ll need to sign in with your cable or satellite TV credentials to access the stream.


Watch on social media
In addition to NBC’s official stream, you can also keep up with the Golden Globes on social media. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organizes the awards, will be posting highlights and behind-the-scenes footage on its Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. You can also follow the hashtags #GoldenGlobes and #Globes75 to see what people are saying about the ceremony on social media.


Watch on streaming services
If you have a subscription to a streaming service like Hulu, Sling TV, YouTube TV, or DirecTV Now, you may be able to watch the Golden Globes through that service. Check with your provider to see if they offer NBC in your area, and if so, whether they’ll be streaming the ceremony live.


No matter how you choose to watch the Golden Globes, it promises to be an exciting evening, with plenty of A-list stars and memorable moments. So grab your popcorn, settle in, and enjoy the show!
