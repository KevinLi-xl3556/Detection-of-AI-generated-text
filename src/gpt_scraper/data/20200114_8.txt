In January 2021, the nominations for the 93rd Academy Awards were announced. As usual, the announcements generated a lot of interest and opinions from movie lovers and industry insiders. However, one of the most significant issues that came up was about the apparent lack of diversity and representation in this year’s nominations. The nominations were criticized for being “very male, very white,” and not reflecting the diverse world we live in.
It is not the first time the Academy Awards have been questioned for their lack of diversity. For the past few years, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite has been trending on social media, reflecting the frustration of people who feel underrepresented in Hollywood. Despite efforts to diversify the industry, the Academy continues to struggle with diversity and inclusivity.
This year’s nominations have raised concerns again, with only two out of twenty actors nominated from people of color and no female directors included. With the global outcry for gender and racial equality, the question stands – why aren’t stories and achievements from a broad diversity of people being recognised?
There are several reasons for this. One contributing factor is the lack of diversity in the entertainment industry, with the majority of decision-makers and gatekeepers being white males. It has been a longstanding, well-documented issue, and people of color and women have been pushing against it for many years.
Another issue is the way the Academy operates. The system is known for being insular, with members reportedly resistant to change. Memberships are primarily based on prior accomplishments or invitations, and the inability of the academy, to open its doors to talents from different backgrounds creates an isolating effect.
The nominations also reflect a wider systemic issue, from the education of screenplay writers to the distribution of major studio funding. The entertainment industry continues to reflect general rules of business. While artistic talent and creative ideas are required, accessing funding, resources and ultimately platform control requires connections, opportunity and a certain level of social status or economic access. This situation leaves many feeling excluded or undervalued.
It is essential to acknowledge and celebrate the talents and creativity of various communities and cultures worldwide. By creating diverse representations of these communities, Hollywood holds significant influence on how society reflects on their art, as well as on how we understand the world around us.
The Academy Awards have enormous power, and the race, gender, sexuality, and culture of contributors to the art must be recognized appropriately. A more nuanced and balanced representation of the diverse talent in the industry surely adds to its appeal and legitimacy.
Change is essential, and the public is making their voices heard in this regard through speaking up on social media, boycotting, and voting with their wallets by choosing to watch films and content produced by more diverse teams. Hollywood in turn needs to balance its structural foundations with the creativity that its people bring to the table to better reflect the world and stand out with meaningful films.
The Oscars should be a platform for showcasing the best of the talent across the globe, without bias or prejudice. The hope is that in the years to come, we see the Academy Awards evolve and become significantly more diverse as it progresses.
