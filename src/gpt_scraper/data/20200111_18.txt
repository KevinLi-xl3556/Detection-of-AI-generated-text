In 2019, Jazz Reckoned With Old Boundaries, and Marched Past Them
The year 2019 was a significant one for jazz music. It was a year in which the genre reckoned with old boundaries and marched past them, embracing new sounds, new styles, and new perspectives. From the emergence of exciting young talent to the reemergence of established veterans, jazz in 2019 was a vibrant and dynamic force.
One of the most exciting developments in jazz in 2019 was the emergence of a new generation of young musicians who are challenging the status quo and pushing the boundaries of the genre. Artists like saxophonist Nubya Garcia and drummer Makaya McCraven are leading the charge, bringing fresh ideas and new energy to jazz.
Garcia, a London-based saxophonist, released her debut album, “Nubya’s 5ive,” in 2017, but it was in 2019 that she really began to make waves. Her performances at festivals like Glastonbury and Love Supreme drew huge crowds and critical acclaim. Her music, which blends elements of jazz, funk, and Afrobeat, is vibrant, energetic, and deeply rooted in the traditions of jazz.
McCraven, a Chicago-based drummer, is similarly innovative. His latest album, “Universal Beings,” is a sprawling, multi-part work that draws on jazz, hip-hop, and electronic music to create something entirely new. The album features collaborations with a diverse range of artists, from guitarist Jeff Parker to rapper and poet Sampa the Great.
But it wasn’t just the new generation of jazz musicians that was making waves in 2019. Established veterans were also pushing the boundaries of the genre in exciting ways. One of the most notable examples was pianist and composer Vijay Iyer, who released his album “Far From Over” in 2017. The album, which features Iyer’s trio, as well as guest appearances from trumpeter Graham Haynes and saxophonist Steve Lehman, is a bold and adventurous work that draws on a wide range of influences, from Indian classical music to electronic music.
Another veteran artist who was making waves in 2019 was saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter. Shorter, who had been a member of Miles Davis’ legendary 1960s quintet, released his album “Emanon” in 2018. The album, which features Shorter’s quartet and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, is a sprawling, three-disc work that includes a graphic novel and a short film. It’s a testament to Shorter’s enduring creativity and willingness to push the boundaries of the genre.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about jazz in 2019 was the way in which it was embracing new sounds, new styles, and new perspectives. Jazz has always been a genre that thrives on innovation and experimentation, and in 2019, it was doing just that. From the fusion of jazz and hip-hop to the incorporation of electronic and world music influences, jazz was a genre that was constantly evolving and expanding.
In conclusion, jazz in 2019 was a genre that was reckoning with old boundaries and marching past them. Whether through the emergence of exciting young talent, the continued creativity of established veterans, or the embrace of new sounds and styles, jazz in 2019 was a vibrant and dynamic force that showed no signs of slowing down. It was a year that reminded us why jazz remains one of the most important and influential genres of music of all time.
