The clock is ticking, and the world is watching as the United Kingdom prepares to leave the European Union. With Brexit looming, many questions remain unanswered, and one of the most significant ones is whether or not Big Ben will chime to mark the occasion.
Big Ben, otherwise known as the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster, has been silent since 2017. The iconic bell was silenced for maintenance work, and the clock tower has been undergoing restoration as part of a £61m overhaul.
However, before the restoration work began, Big Ben chimed for significant events, such as New Year’s Eve and Remembrance Day. There are those who believe that Big Ben should chime for Brexit, considering the momentousness of the occasion.
The person who has the final say on whether or not Big Ben will chime for Brexit is the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Sir Hoyle has emphasized that he is not opposed to Big Ben chiming for Brexit but notes that it will be expensive.
The estimated cost of restoring Big Ben’s chimes for Brexit is £500,000, or approximately $650,000. Some have criticized the high cost, arguing that the money could be better spent elsewhere. Others believe that the cost is a small price to pay for such a historic event.
There are also concerns that if Big Ben is allowed to chime for Brexit, it could set a precedent for other political events. Some worry that it could be divisive and fuel further political tensions.
The controversy surrounding the possibility of Big Ben chime for Brexit highlights the deep divisions and uncertainty surrounding the UK’s departure from the EU. While some argue that the chiming of Big Ben would be a symbol of the UK’s sovereignty, others see it as a waste of money.
As the deadline for Brexit approaches, the fate of Big Ben’s chimes remains uncertain. While it may seem like a trivial matter, the controversy highlights the deeper issues at play in the UK’s departure from the EU. Whatever the outcome, Brexit will undoubtedly be a significant event in British history, with or without Big Ben’s chimes.
