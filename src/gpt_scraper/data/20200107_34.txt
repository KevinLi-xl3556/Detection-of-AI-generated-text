Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has confirmed that he will go ahead with the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump without a deal on witnesses. This announcement comes after weeks of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on the terms of the trial.
Democrats had been pushing for the trial to include testimony from witnesses, including some of the lawmakers who were present during the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Republicans, however, had been resistant to the idea of calling witnesses, arguing that doing so would open a Pandora’s box of political retribution and set a dangerous precedent for future impeachment trials.
In a statement released on Friday, McConnell said that while he still believed that calling witnesses would be “unnecessary,” he was “prepared to proceed” with the trial either way. He also argued that the Senate had already conducted a thorough investigation into the events of January 6th and that there was no need to drag the trial out any longer.
“The Senate has held hearings. The American people have heard all they need to hear,” McConnell said. “Now it’s time to move on and focus on the serious challenges facing our country.”
Democrats, however, are unlikely to be satisfied with McConnell’s decision. Many had hoped that calling witnesses would provide additional evidence to support their case against Trump and perhaps even sway some Republican senators to vote for conviction.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer released a statement on Friday condemning McConnell’s decision and reiterating his own call for a fair and impartial trial.
“Make no mistake, there will be a trial, and the evidence against Donald Trump will be presented, in living color, for the nation and every one of us to see,” Schumer said. “We will seek witnesses, and we will present a compelling case, so that the Senate – and the American people – can determine the truth and make a judgment.”
The impeachment trial is set to begin the week of February 8th. While it remains to be seen whether witnesses will be called, one thing is certain: the eyes of the nation will be fixed on the Senate as they weigh the fate of a former president who has already left an indelible mark on American history.
