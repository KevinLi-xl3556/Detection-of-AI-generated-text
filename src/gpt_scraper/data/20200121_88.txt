In recent years, the topic of refugees has been a hot button issue in the United States. While some states and cities have embraced refugees with open arms, others have been more hesitant to welcome them into their communities. One Texas city, however, is taking a stand and saying “yes” to refugees while the state’s governor says “no.”
The city in question is none other than Amarillo, a city primarily known for its cattle industry but is increasingly becoming recognized as a welcoming place for refugees. Since 2010, the city has resettled nearly 1,000 refugees from countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Syria.
Despite the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, issuing an executive order in 2015 blocking the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Amarillo continues to welcome those seeking refuge. Mayor Ginger Nelson has been a vocal advocate for refugees and argues that they are an important part of the city’s economy and workforce.
In an interview with NPR, Mayor Nelson stated, “We have the workforce needs, and we also have a compassionate heart. Those are two things that you don’t always have in a community.” She went on to explain that refugees have filled much-needed jobs in the city’s meatpacking plants and have started their own businesses.
Amarillo’s welcoming stance on refugees has not come without its challenges, however. Some community members have expressed concerns about security and the potential for terrorism. Mayor Nelson and other city leaders have worked to address these fears by partnering with local law enforcement and refugee resettlement agencies to ensure the safety and security of all residents.
In addition to security concerns, Amarillo has also faced criticism from some state officials. In 2019, state representative Four Price introduced a bill that would have required local governments to get approval from the state before accepting refugees. The bill ultimately did not pass, but it highlights the ongoing tension between local communities and the state government over refugee resettlement.
Despite these challenges, Amarillo remains a shining example of a city that is saying “yes” to refugees. By welcoming those seeking refuge, the city is not only providing a safe haven for those fleeing violence and persecution but is also reaping economic benefits and enriching its cultural diversity.
As Mayor Nelson put it, “I believe that the richness of our community comes from diversity. And so by having refugees who have lived around the world, they make us a richer community.” It is this belief in the power of diversity and compassion that has led Amarillo to say “yes” to refugees even in the face of political opposition.
