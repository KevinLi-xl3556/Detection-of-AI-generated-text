In recent years, newspapers across the United States have been struggling to stay afloat. The rise of digital media has cut into print circulation, and advertising revenue has dwindled as companies increasingly turn to internet advertising. In this climate, many newspapers have been forced to cut back their staff and merge with other papers to survive, while some have simply ceased publication altogether.
The Chicago Tribune, one of the oldest and most respected newspapers in the country, has not been immune to these challenges. After being purchased in 2018 by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, many worried that the newspaper would be “picked to the bone” - stripped of its assets and resources, and left to wither away.
Alden Global Capital has become notorious for its history of buying up struggling newspapers and cutting costs by reducing staff, closing bureaus, and selling property. Many see the company’s acquisition of the Chicago Tribune as a sign that the newspaper’s days may be numbered.
So, will the Chicago Tribune be the next newspaper picked to the bone? The answer is not clear, but there are certainly reasons to be concerned. Already, the newspaper has seen significant cuts to its staff, including the elimination of the paper’s public editor position. The Tribune’s newsroom has also been merged with the smaller Chicago Sun-Times, in a move that many worry will weaken the Tribune’s voice and dilute its coverage.
However, it’s worth noting that not all newspapers owned by Alden Global Capital have met the same fate. The Denver Post, another paper owned by the hedge fund, has managed to survive despite significant cutbacks. While the paper’s staff has been reduced by more than half, it has continued to produce high-quality journalism and maintain a loyal readership.
Ultimately, the fate of the Chicago Tribune rests with Alden Global Capital. If the company continues to slash resources and assets, the paper may struggle to remain viable. However, if the hedge fund is willing to invest in the Tribune’s future, it’s possible that the newspaper could not only survive, but thrive in the years to come.
In the end, the question of whether the Chicago Tribune will be picked to the bone is one that only time can answer. It’s impossible to predict the future, especially in such tumultuous times for the newspaper industry. However, no matter what happens, it’s clear that the Chicago Tribune - like so many newspapers across the country - is fighting for its survival.
