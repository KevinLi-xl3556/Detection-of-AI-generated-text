Every year, fans around the globe eagerly anticipate the start of a new season, eager to see their favorite teams and players in action. With the start of the 2020 season just around the corner, it’s time to make some fearless predictions for what’s to come.

The Lakers Will Repeat as NBA Champions

The Los Angeles Lakers dominated the NBA playoffs last year, winning their 17th championship in franchise history. With superstars LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the charge, the Lakers are poised to repeat as champions in 2020. They have a deep and talented roster, and their experience and chemistry make them a tough team to beat.

The Brooklyn Nets Will Make a Deep Playoff Run

The Brooklyn Nets have been building towards a championship for several years now. With the additions of superstars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, the Nets have the firepower to compete with any team in the league. While they may need some time to build chemistry, they have the talent to make a deep playoff run in 2020.

Giannis Antetokounmpo Will Win His Second MVP Award

Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo won his first NBA MVP award in 2019, and he’s poised to win it again in 2020. Antetokounmpo is one of the most dominant players in the league, with a rare combination of size, speed, and athleticism. He’s also improved his shooting and playmaking abilities, making him an even more dangerous player on the court.

The Philadelphia 76ers Will Disappoint

The Philadelphia 76ers have been one of the most hyped teams in the league in recent years. They have a talented roster, led by stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, but they have yet to live up to their potential. In 2020, the 76ers will disappoint once again, struggling to make a deep playoff run.

The Miami Heat Will Surprise Everyone
