The Nashville Hot Chicken craze has taken over the United States in recent years, with spicy fried chicken becoming a must-try dish for foodies everywhere. While Nashville may be the birthplace of this fiery delight, it’s quickly spreading to other cities across the country, including Los Angeles.
In recent years, several restaurants in Los Angeles have added Nashville Hot Chicken to their menus, but one establishment has truly made it their own. Howlin’ Ray’s, located in Chinatown, has become the go-to spot for authentic Nashville-style hot chicken in LA.
The story of Howlin’ Ray’s began when owner Johnny Ray Zone and his wife Amanda visited Nashville and fell in love with the city’s famous hot chicken. They decided to bring the dish back to LA and open their own restaurant, which they did in 2015. Since then, Howlin’ Ray’s has gained a cult following among Angelenos and has even been featured on popular food shows like “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.”
What sets Howlin’ Ray’s apart from other restaurants serving Nashville Hot Chicken is their commitment to authenticity. They use the same cooking techniques and spice blends that are used in Nashville, and their chicken is always fresh, never frozen. They also offer a range of spice levels, from “mild” to “howlin’,” so customers can choose the level of heat that’s right for them.
But it’s not just the food that keeps customers coming back to Howlin’ Ray’s. The restaurant has a fun, laid-back atmosphere, with picnic tables and string lights creating a casual vibe. And the staff is always friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall experience.
Of course, with popularity comes long lines, and Howlin’ Ray’s is no exception. On weekends, it’s not uncommon to see a line stretching around the block, with customers willing to wait hours just to get their hands on some hot chicken. But most customers will tell you that it’s worth the wait.
While Howlin’ Ray’s is the most well-known Nashville Hot Chicken spot in LA, it’s not the only one. Other restaurants, like Dave’s Hot Chicken and Hotville Chicken, have also gained a following for their take on the dish. But there’s no denying that Howlin’ Ray’s is the OG when it comes to Nashville Hot Chicken in LA.
If you’re a fan of spicy food and haven’t tried Nashville Hot Chicken yet, a visit to Howlin’ Ray’s is a must. Just be prepared to wait in line, and bring some milk to cool down your taste buds after you take that first bite.
