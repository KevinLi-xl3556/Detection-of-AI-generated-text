In the wake of the U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian General Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad, antiwar protesters across the United States took to the streets to condemn the action, calling for an end to the cycle of violence before further harm is done.
From major cities like New York and Los Angeles to smaller communities like Des Moines and Boise, citizens of all walks of life and political affiliations gathered to express their outrage at what they see as an aggressive act of war that will only escalate tensions in the Middle East and put more lives at risk.
At rallies and marches in dozens of cities, protesters held signs with messages like “No More War” and “Stop U.S. Imperialism,” while chanting slogans like “Peace, not war” and “No justice, no peace.” Many also shared their personal stories of how war has affected their lives, either as veterans or as family members of soldiers who were killed or wounded in previous conflicts.
In some cases, the protests turned confrontational, with clashes between police and protesters resulting in arrests and injuries. But despite these incidents, organizers of the protests say they are determined to continue speaking out against what they see as a dangerous and reckless foreign policy that puts American lives and global stability at risk.
“Today we stand with our brothers and sisters in the Middle East who have suffered the unjust violence of war for far too long,” said one speaker at a rally in Chicago. “We demand that our government take a different path, one that prioritizes diplomacy, human rights, and the pursuit of lasting peace.”
The killing of Suleimani has raised tensions in the already volatile Middle East region, with Iran vowing to retaliate against the U.S. for what it sees as a targeted assassination of a key military leader. The move has also sparked concerns among some lawmakers and advocates that it could lead to another catastrophic war in the region.
“The decision to launch this attack without consulting Congress or considering the potential long-term consequences was reckless and unnecessary,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren in a statement. “We need to deescalate tensions and pursue diplomatic solutions that will bring greater security and stability to the region.”
Despite these calls for a more restrained approach to foreign policy, President Trump and his administration have defended the decision to take out Suleimani, arguing that he posed an imminent threat to American interests and that the U.S. had the right to act in self-defense.
As the debate over the wisdom and legality of the drone strike continues to play out in the halls of power and among the broader public, antiwar protesters say they will continue to use their voices and their bodies to call for peace and justice in the face of what they see as a dangerous and destabilizing moment in American history.
“We cannot allow this grave injustice to go unchallenged,” said one protester in Boston. “We have a moral duty to speak out against war and violence, and to demand better from our leaders and from ourselves. The only way to break this vicious cycle is to refuse to participate in it any longer.”
