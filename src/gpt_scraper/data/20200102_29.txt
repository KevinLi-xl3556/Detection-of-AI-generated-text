A lawsuit against Artforum, a leading art publication, will proceed after a recent court ruling, but claims against the publisher were dismissed. The lawsuit was brought by Amanda Schmitt, a former employee of the magazine, who accused her former boss, Knight Landesman, of sexual harassment.
Schmitt filed the lawsuit in 2017, accusing Landesman of sexual harassment and Artforum of creating a hostile work environment. The lawsuit also named the magazine’s publisher, Knight-Wallace Inc., as a defendant. However, a recent ruling by a New York judge dismissed the claims against the publisher, stating that there was not enough evidence to support the allegations.
The judge’s decision means that the lawsuit will proceed against Artforum and Landesman individually. Schmitt’s claims include sexual harassment, retaliation, and gender discrimination. She alleges that Landesman made unwanted sexual advances towards her, including groping her in public, and that Artforum ignored her complaints and created a hostile work environment.
The lawsuit is one of many high-profile cases that have emerged in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has brought attention to the widespread issue of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The art world has been particularly affected, with several prominent figures in the industry facing allegations of sexual misconduct.
In response to the lawsuit, Artforum issued a statement expressing regret over the situation and stating that they are committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment for all employees. The magazine also announced several measures to address the issue, including the formation of a task force to review its policies and procedures.
The case is a reminder of the importance of addressing sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Employers have a responsibility to create a safe and respectful work environment for all employees, and to take allegations of harassment and discrimination seriously.
The dismissal of claims against the publisher in the Artforum case highlights the complexity of such cases and the need for strong evidence to support allegations. However, the fact that the lawsuit will proceed against Artforum and Landesman sends a clear message that sexual harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated in the workplace.
As the #MeToo movement continues to shine a spotlight on this issue, it is important for employers to take proactive steps to prevent harassment and discrimination, including implementing clear policies and procedures, providing training and support for employees, and responding promptly and appropriately to allegations of misconduct. By doing so, they can create a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.
