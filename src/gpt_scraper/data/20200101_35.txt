The highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-thriller ‘A Quiet Place’ is finally here. The first trailer for ‘A Quiet Place Part II’ has been released, and fans are already buzzing about the film. However, one question on everyone’s mind is: Why is it so noisy?
For those who haven’t seen the first film, ‘A Quiet Place’ tells the story of a family trying to survive in a world overrun by vicious creatures who hunt by sound. The family must live in complete silence, communicating through sign language, and taking every precaution to avoid making noise that could attract the monsters.
The first film was a massive success, grossing over $340 million worldwide and earning critical acclaim. Fans have been eagerly anticipating the sequel, and the first trailer has given them a glimpse of what’s to come.
The trailer opens with a flashback to the day the creatures first arrived, showing the chaos that ensued as people tried to flee the city. The scene is filled with noise and chaos, a stark contrast to the silence that dominates most of the first film.
As the trailer progresses, we see the surviving members of the Abbott family venture out into the world, encountering other survivors and new dangers. The creatures are still lurking, and the family must continue to navigate their world in silence.
So, why is the trailer so noisy? Director John Krasinski has stated that he wanted to expand the world of the first film and show audiences what happened on the day the creatures arrived. This means that the opening sequence of the trailer is intentionally loud and chaotic, contrasting with the quiet and tension of the rest of the film.
Additionally, the sequel will introduce new characters and settings, which means that there will be more opportunities for sound in the film. While the first film was mostly silent, the sequel will have more traditional sound design, such as music and dialogue.
However, fans can rest assured that the film will still be a tense and thrilling experience, with the same focus on sound as the first film. Krasinski has stated that sound will continue to be a crucial element in the film, and the trailer certainly hints at plenty of tense moments.
Overall, the first trailer for ‘A Quiet Place Part II’ has fans excited for the sequel. While the opening sequence may be noisy, the film will still be a thrilling and suspenseful experience, with the same focus on sound as the first film. Fans can’t wait to see what’s in store for the Abbott family and the world of ‘A Quiet Place’.
