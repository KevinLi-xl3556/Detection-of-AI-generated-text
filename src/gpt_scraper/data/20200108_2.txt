Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime member of the Supreme Court of the United States, has recently announced that she is cancer-free once again. In a statement released by the court on Friday, Justice Ginsburg revealed that she had been undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer but had since completed that treatment and was now in good health.
This marks the fifth time that the 86-year-old justice has battled cancer, having previously been diagnosed with colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer in 2009 and 2019, and lung cancer in 2018. Despite these health challenges, Justice Ginsburg has continued to serve on the Supreme Court and has become an icon in the fight for gender equality and civil rights.
In the statement released by the court, Justice Ginsburg expressed her gratitude for the support she has received from friends, family, and the public during her latest cancer treatment. She also acknowledged that her good health was due in part to the dedication of her medical team.
Pancreatic cancer is a particularly challenging form of cancer to treat, with a survival rate of less than 10 percent for patients diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease. However, Justice Ginsburg’s diagnosis was caught early, allowing for successful treatment and recovery.
Justice Ginsburg’s latest health scare has led to renewed speculation about her potential retirement from the Supreme Court. However, Justice Ginsburg has repeatedly stated that she has no intention of stepping down from her role on the court, and has even hired law clerks through the court’s term ending in 2020.
Justice Ginsburg’s commitment to her work and her dedication to fighting for justice and equality for all Americans have made her an inspiration to many. Her continued good health is a relief to her many admirers, who hope that she will remain on the bench for many years to come.
