A Homecoming at Taal Volcano: ‘Everything’s Gone in the Blink of an Eye.’
For years, the Taal Volcano in the Philippines has been one of the country’s biggest tourist attractions. The volcano’s stunning beauty and serene surroundings have enchanted many visitors. However, on January 12, 2020, everything changed. The Taal Volcano erupted after being dormant for decades, and over 6,000 people were forced to flee their homes. The devastation was heartbreaking, but it also brought people together.
Months later, some of those displaced by the eruption returned home. It was an emotional homecoming for many, who found their homes and communities destroyed or damaged beyond recognition. The once-thriving towns around the Taal Volcano are now unrecognizable, covered in ash and volcanic debris. However, despite this, the people who have returned to the area are determined to rebuild their lives and communities.
For many of these people, the Taal Volcano is not just a geological phenomenon; it is a deeply spiritual place. It is the source of their livelihoods, their traditions, and in many cases, their identity. The eruption of Taal Volcano has disrupted not just their homes but also their lives and cultural traditions.
One story that stands out is from a man named Leonardo Diokno. He is a farmer who has lived near the Taal Volcano for his whole life. When the eruption happened, his farm, which had been in his family for generations, was destroyed. Despite the devastation, he remained hopeful that he could return home and rebuild his life. He returned to his land and hopes to restore his farm and his community.
Another story is that of Crisanto Sabitan, a resident of Talisay town, which was badly affected by the eruption. Sabitan chose to stay behind and help his neighbors evacuate, despite being told to leave himself. “Everything’s gone in the blink of an eye,” Sabitan says, “but we are not lost. We have each other.”
These stories of resilience and determination are pervasive in the communities around Taal Volcano. Despite the overwhelming destruction, the people who live here are determined to rebuild their homes and their lives. These communities are bonded by a deep love for their homes and a determination to protect them. The eruption of Taal Volcano was a tragedy, but it has also demonstrated the bravery and resilience of the Filipino people.
