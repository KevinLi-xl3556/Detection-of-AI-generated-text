New Year, New Energy: This Week in the 2020 Race
With the start of the new year, the 2020 race has taken on new energy as the candidates ramp up their campaigns and prepare for the critical primary and caucus states ahead. Here are some of the key developments and events from the past week.
Democratic Debate
The first major event of the year was the Democratic debate on January 14th in Des Moines, Iowa. The seven candidates on stage - Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang - covered a range of topics, including healthcare, foreign policy, climate change, and gun control.
One of the most heated moments of the night came when Warren and Sanders clashed over a reported conversation in 2018 regarding whether a woman could win the presidency. While tensions flared on stage, some analysts argue that the exchange may have deeper implications for the progressive lane of the Democratic party.
Iowa Polls
Four days after the debate, the highly anticipated Iowa Poll was released by the Des Moines Register and CNN. The poll showed a tight race among the top four candidates: Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, and Biden. While the margin of error was 4 percentage points, the poll suggested that Sanders had taken a lead over his competitors.
However, the poll also revealed a potentially concerning trend for the progressive wing of the party. While Sanders and Warren have been leading among the most liberal and progressive voters, Buttigieg saw a sudden surge in approval among this group, which could impact the final outcome of the caucuses on February 3rd.
Endorsements
This week also saw a flurry of endorsements from top politicians and activists. New York Times editorial board announced its endorsement of both Warren and Klobuchar, marking only the third time in history that the paper has decided to not chose only one candidate as its recommended nominee.
Meanwhile, Sanders received the endorsement of three influential members of “The Squad” - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib - strengthening his position as the leading progressive candidate in the race.
Outlook
As the candidates march forward to the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, many questions remain about the direction of the Democratic party and who can unite the various factions. Will the progressive wing continue to gain ground, or will moderates like Biden or Buttigieg make a comeback? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain: the 2020 race is heating up, and the new year has brought a renewed sense of energy and excitement to the campaign trail.
