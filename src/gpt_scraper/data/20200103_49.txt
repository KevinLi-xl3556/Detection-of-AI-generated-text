In the world of horror films, few franchises have been as enduring as “The Grudge.” Since the release of the original Japanese film in 2002, the series has spawned sequels, remakes, and countless imitators. The latest entry in the franchise, simply titled “The Grudge,” aims to bring a fresh take on the story of a cursed house that leaves its inhabitants marked for death.
Directed by Nicolas Pesce, the film follows a detective named Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough) as she investigates a series of grisly murders that seem to be connected to a house in a small town. As she delves deeper into the case, Muldoon discovers that the house has a dark history, and that a curse seems to be attached to it. The curse, as it turns out, is not easily lifted, and anyone who enters the house is doomed to suffer a terrible fate.
Despite its promising premise, “The Grudge” ultimately fails to deliver the scares that horror fans crave. The film is a slow burn that takes its time setting up its characters and the mystery surrounding the house. While this approach can work in some horror films, it ultimately feels like a misstep here. The film takes too long to get going, and by the time it finally does, the scares are few and far between.
Another issue with the film is its lack of memorable characters. While Andrea Riseborough does a decent job as Muldoon, the other characters are largely forgettable. This makes it difficult for the audience to invest in their fates, and as a result, the film’s scares fall flat.
Perhaps the biggest problem with “The Grudge” is that it feels like a retread of previous entries in the franchise. While there are a few new twists and turns, the film ultimately feels like a rehash of ideas that we’ve seen before. The cursed house, the mysterious deaths, and the supernatural elements all feel familiar, and as a result, the film lacks the freshness and originality that could have made it stand out.
Overall, “The Grudge” is a disappointing entry in the franchise. While it has its moments, it ultimately fails to deliver the scares and thrills that horror fans crave. If you’re a diehard fan of the series, you may find something to enjoy here, but for everyone else, it’s best to steer clear of this cursed house.
