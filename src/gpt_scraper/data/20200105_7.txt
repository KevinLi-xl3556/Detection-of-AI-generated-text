On third down and ten yards to go, Keenum found Diggs with a perfectly thrown pass that allowed him to break away and score the game-winning touchdown.
The victory was especially sweet for the Vikings and their fans, as it marked the first time the team has won a playoff game since 2009.

Overall, the Vikings’ victory was a testament to their resilience and determination. Despite falling behind early in the game, they never gave up and continued to fight until the very end. The team will now move on to face the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game, with a chance to earn a spot in the Super Bowl. If they can continue to play with the same heart and tenacity that they displayed against the Saints, there is no doubt that they will have a good chance of advancing to the biggest game of the year.
