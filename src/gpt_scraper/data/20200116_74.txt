As the impeached former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial formally began on January 26, 2021, here are the key moments to keep an eye on as the proceedings unfold:


The Senate’s decision on the constitutionality of the trial: On the first day of the trial, Senators voted on whether the trial was constitutional to impeach a former President. The vote failed with 56-44, meaning the trial will proceed.


Opening arguments from the House impeachment managers and Trump’s lawyers: Following the constitutionality vote, the House impeachment managers, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin, made their opening arguments outlining why they believe Trump should be held accountable for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the U.S Capitol. Trump’s lawyers, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, also delivered their opening statements, arguing that the trial is unconstitutional and a violation of Trump’s First Amendment rights.


Presentation of evidence: In the coming days of the trial, both sides will present their evidence, including documents, video footage, and witness testimonies, to support their arguments.


Witnesses: Though it is unsure whether witnesses will be called, Democrats may push to have witnesses testify, including those who were present at the Capitol during the insurrection, and Trump himself.


Jury decision: After both sides present their arguments and evidence, the Senate will vote on whether to convict or acquit Trump. A two-thirds majority vote is needed for conviction, which means at least 17 Republican Senators would have to vote in favor of it.


These key moments will determine the outcome of Trump’s second impeachment trial, as well as the future of American politics. The proceedings will continue to be closely watched by both parties, as well as Americans across the country who are seeking accountability for the events on January 6.
