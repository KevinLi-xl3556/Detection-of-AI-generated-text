Winter Jazzfest is one of the most significant jazz events of the year, and it’s always a barometer of where jazz is going in the future. In particular, the 2020 Winter Jazzfest held in New York City was a particularly interesting look at where jazz is headed in the coming years.
One of the most notable trends at the 2020 Winter Jazzfest was a shift towards a more adventurous, experimental sound. Many of the performers at the festival were exploring new sounds and pushing the boundaries of what jazz can be. This was particularly true of the younger musicians on the scene, who are bringing fresh energy and ideas to the jazz world.
Another notable trend at the festival was the increasing diversity of the jazz scene. This year’s festival featured more women and people of color than ever before. This is a welcome change in a genre that has traditionally been dominated by white men, and it bodes well for the future of jazz.
One of the most exciting performances at the festival was by a group called Irreversible Entanglements. This group features musicians from all over the world, and their experimental sound combines elements of free jazz, spoken word, and punk rock. It’s a fresh and exciting approach to jazz, and it’s clear that these musicians are pushing the genre in new and exciting directions.
Another highlight of the festival was the performance by the group Makaya McCraven. McCraven is a drummer and producer who combines the sounds of jazz with hip-hop, electronica, and other genres. His music is a perfect example of the experimental and genre-defying approach that many jazz musicians are taking today.
Overall, the 2020 Winter Jazzfest was a reflection of the exciting and innovative direction that jazz is going in. With more and more musicians pushing the boundaries of what jazz can be, it’s clear that the genre is alive and well. And with a greater diversity of voices than ever before, it seems likely that jazz will continue to evolve and grow in exciting new directions in the years to come.
