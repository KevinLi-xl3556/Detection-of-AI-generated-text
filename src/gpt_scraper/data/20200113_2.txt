France Agrees to Small Troop Increase, but Little Else, at Sahel Summit
On April 15, 2023, the leaders of France and five Sahel nations met in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, for a summit on security in the region. The summit was called to address the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel, a semi-arid region that stretches across West Africa from Senegal to Sudan.
France has been leading a military operation in the Sahel since 2014, known as Operation Barkhane, with the aim of combatting jihadist groups in the region. However, the operation has faced criticism from some Sahel countries and France has been seeking greater support from them.
At the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would be increasing its troop numbers in the Sahel by 500, bringing the total number of French troops in the region to around 5,000. However, Macron also said that France would be scaling back its military presence in the region over the next few years, with a view to ending Operation Barkhane by 2025.
The leaders of the five Sahel nations – Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger – welcomed the troop increase but did not offer any new commitments of their own. The summit ended without any new agreements on financing or coordinating military operations in the region.
The lack of concrete progress at the summit highlights the challenges of addressing the security situation in the Sahel, which has been characterized by a complex mix of jihadist insurgency, inter-communal violence, and organized crime. The region has seen a surge in violence in recent years, with jihadist groups such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) carrying out attacks on civilian and military targets.
The Sahel countries have been calling for greater international support in their efforts to combat these groups, but France has been the main foreign power involved in military operations in the region. The lack of commitment from other countries at the summit is likely to raise questions about the sustainability of the French presence in the Sahel.
Critics of Operation Barkhane argue that the French military intervention has not succeeded in achieving its objectives and has instead contributed to further destabilization in the region. They point to the civilian casualties caused by French airstrikes and the resentment that this has created among local populations.
The summit also came amid growing concerns about the impact of climate change on the Sahel, which is one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of global warming. The leaders of the Sahel nations called for greater international support to address the environmental challenges facing the region, including desertification and drought.
In conclusion, the Sahel summit highlighted the challenges of addressing the security and environmental challenges facing the region. While France agreed to a small troop increase, there was little concrete progress on other fronts. The lack of commitment from the Sahel countries themselves raises questions about the sustainability of the French presence in the region, and the need for a more coordinated and sustained international response to the challenges facing the Sahel.
