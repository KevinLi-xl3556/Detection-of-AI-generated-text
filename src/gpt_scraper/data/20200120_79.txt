As we approach yet another election year, the topic of politics is undoubtedly at the forefront of many people’s minds. With the constant news and updates of the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, it’s clear that politics is as polarizing and heated as ever. However, while the impeachment has dominated the headlines, something interesting has been occurring within the advertising world - ads are staying away from politics.
This shift away from political ads is a stark contrast from previous election years, where political ads would flood our televisions, social media feeds, and other forms of media. Political campaigns typically allocate a substantial portion of their budget towards advertising, as it’s a crucial component of getting their message across to the masses. Whether it’s a commercial showcasing a candidate’s accomplishments or attacking their opponent’s record, these ads are typically omnipresent during election season.
However, many advertisers seem to be taking a different approach this time around. Rather than expose themselves to the possibility of partisan backlash, many brands are choosing to play it safe by not touching politics at all. The risk of alienating potential customers by making a bold political statement is high, and for many companies, it’s not worth the gamble.
In fact, some companies are even taking an active stance by choosing to avoid politics altogether. Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, made headlines when he announced earlier this year that the ride-share giant would not be running political ads. In a tweet, Khosrowshahi stated, “We don’t think it’s appropriate for us to be running ads about contentious political issues - like impeachment - on Uber.”
This reluctance to touch politics is a reflection of the current political climate, which is more polarized than ever. Brands risk alienating entire groups of consumers if they take a side, and in a time when customer loyalty is hard to come by, companies can’t afford to take that chance. But is it really a good idea for brands to avoid politics altogether?
On one hand, it makes sense for brands to focus on their core values and avoid getting caught up in politics. However, this approach can also be seen as being complacent in a world where social and political issues are becoming increasingly important to consumers. Companies must acknowledge that politics plays a role in their bottom line, whether they like it or not.
Additionally, in a society where people are more vocal than ever about their beliefs and values, brands that choose to stay out of politics risk being seen as out of touch, apathetic, or even cowardly. Consumers want to know where brands stand on important issues, and those that sidestep or water down their beliefs may ultimately suffer in the long run.
In conclusion, it’s clear that brands are avoiding politics for a variety of reasons. While some may argue that it’s a smart move, others may see it as a missed opportunity to take a stand and connect with customers on a deeper level. As we head into an election year, it will be interesting to see if more brands choose to stay out of the political fray, or if they choose to take a more active stance.
