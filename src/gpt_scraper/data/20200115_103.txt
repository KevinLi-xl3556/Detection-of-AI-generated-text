As the middle of the week dawns upon us, we’re faced with a flurry of events that carry significant impact on the political landscape. From the ongoing impeachment investigations to the Democratic debates and the recent trade deal, let’s dive into your Wednesday briefing.
Impeachment
The impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump continues to dominate headlines. Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony from four law professors regarding the constitutional basis for impeaching a president. The panel of witnesses consisted of three witnesses invited by Democrats, and one invited by Republicans. While the Republican witness, Jonathan Turley, acknowledged that Trump’s actions were “clearly wrong”, he also argued that the current impeachment inquiry is offensive and weak.
Democratic Debate
Last night, seven candidates took to the debate stage in Los Angeles for the sixth Democratic debate. The candidates focused on a wide range of issues, including healthcare, climate change, criminal justice reform, and more. As expected, Pete Buttigieg faced significant criticism from the other candidates, with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both questioning his fundraising tactics and his lack of experience.
Trade Deal
The US, Canada, and Mexico reached an agreement yesterday to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), includes new provisions regarding labor rights, digital trade, and greater access to Canadian dairy for US farmers. The revised agreement still needs to be approved by Congress and the Canadian and Mexican governments.
As we head into the latter half of the week, these stories will continue to develop and shape the political landscape. Whether it’s the ongoing impeachment inquiry, the Democratic candidates jostling for position, or the newly revised trade agreement, there is no shortage of critical issues to follow. Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the end of 2019.
