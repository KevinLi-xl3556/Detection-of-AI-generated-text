In a time when traditional values and social norms are constantly being challenged and the very foundation of societies is being shaken, the beauty of literature remains a stronghold for many of us. Such is the case of Garth Greenwell’s novel, “What Belongs to You”, where his narrator comes alive in the midst of a dying country.
The book is a portrait of a Bulgaria that is facing its own demons, where the infrastructure is crumbling and corruption is rampant. Garth Greenwell paints a stark picture of the decay of a society that is slowly losing its moral compass, and it is against this backdrop that he introduces us to his nameless narrator.
The narrator, an American teacher who has come to Bulgaria to teach English, is a complex character who is not afraid to confront his own demons. He is a gay man who is struggling to find acceptance in a country where homosexuality is still not widely accepted. He is lonely in a place where human connections are becoming increasingly difficult to make. As he navigates through the complexities of his new surroundings, he becomes more and more alive.
Greenwell’s writing is masterful, and with every sentence, the reader is transported into the mind and soul of the narrator. The descriptions of the Bulgarian landscape, as well as the daily life of the Bulgarian people, are vivid and almost tactile. The reader can almost taste the food, feel the heat of the sun, and smell the air. The author’s use of language is remarkable, and it is clear that he has put a lot of thought into every word on the page.
Through the narrator’s experiences, we get a glimpse into the inner workings of a country that is on the brink of collapse. We see the struggles of people who are trying to make ends meet, who are trying to survive in a society that is rapidly deteriorating. But we also see the beauty of human connection, the resilience of the human spirit, and the power of literature to lift us out of our despair.
In the end, “What Belongs to You” is a novel about hope. It is a story of a man who is able to find meaning and purpose even in the midst of chaos and despair. It is a story that reminds us that there is still beauty in the world, even in the darkest of times. And it is a story that will stay with readers long after they have closed the book.
