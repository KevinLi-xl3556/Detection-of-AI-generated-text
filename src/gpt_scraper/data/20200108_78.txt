As the governor of New York State, Andrew Cuomo has an ambitious agenda for 2020. He has outlined eight key priorities for the year, ranging from healthcare to transportation to education. Here are the eight things Cuomo wants to do in 2020:


Pass a Comprehensive Healthcare Plan
Cuomo has made healthcare a top priority in his agenda for 2020. He wants to pass a comprehensive healthcare plan that will ensure all New Yorkers have access to affordable and quality healthcare. This includes expanding Medicaid, reducing prescription drug prices, and investing in community health centers.


Create More Affordable Housing
The cost of living in New York City is notoriously high, and Cuomo wants to make sure that more New Yorkers have access to affordable housing. He plans to create more affordable housing units and protect tenants’ rights.


Improve Transportation Infrastructure
Cuomo has long been an advocate for improving New York’s transportation infrastructure. In 2020, he plans to continue investing in transportation projects, including building new airports and improving the state’s public transportation systems.


Expand Access to Education
Cuomo believes that education is key to unlocking economic opportunity for New Yorkers. In 2020, he plans to expand access to education by investing in early childhood education and making college more affordable.


Protect the Environment
Climate change is a major threat facing the world today, and Cuomo is committed to protecting the environment. He plans to invest in renewable energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect New York’s natural resources.


Strengthen Gun Laws
New York already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, but Cuomo believes there is more that can be done to prevent gun violence. He plans to strengthen gun laws by closing loopholes and increasing penalties for gun crimes.


Combat Opioid Addiction
The opioid epidemic has hit New York particularly hard, and Cuomo wants to combat addiction by investing in treatment programs and cracking down on illegal opioid trafficking.


Promote Criminal Justice Reform
Cuomo has been a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform, and he plans to continue that work in 2020. He wants to reform the bail system, reduce the number of people in jail, and provide more support to people reentering society after serving time.


These are just a few of the things Cuomo wants to do in 2020. He is committed to improving the lives of all New Yorkers and making the state a better place to live, work, and raise a family.
