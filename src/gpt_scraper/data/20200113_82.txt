As the debate over healthcare continues to rage on in the United States, one of the most contentious issues has been the protection of pre-existing conditions. This refers to the practice of preventing health insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on a person’s medical history.
While many politicians have spoken out in favor of protecting pre-existing conditions, one name that often comes up in opposition is former President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he supports protections for pre-existing conditions, but the reality is that his actions during his presidency have done little to support this claim.
To the contrary, Trump has tried to weaken protections for pre-existing conditions in several ways. Here are just a few examples:

Attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, included many provisions designed to protect people with pre-existing conditions. For example, the law prevented insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions.
Despite this, Trump repeatedly attempted to repeal the ACA during his presidency. If he had been successful, the protections for pre-existing conditions would have been eliminated along with the rest of the law.

Allowed the sale of short-term health plans

In 2018, the Trump administration finalized a rule that allowed the sale of short-term health plans that do not have to comply with many of the ACA’s protections. These plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, among other things.
While proponents of short-term plans argue that they provide a cheaper alternative to ACA-compliant plans, critics say that they leave people with pre-existing conditions vulnerable to discrimination by insurers.

Supported a lawsuit to overturn the ACA

In 2018, a group of Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit arguing that the ACA was unconstitutional. The Trump administration supported the lawsuit, and in 2020, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case.
If the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of the lawsuit, the entire ACA would have been struck down, including the protections for pre-existing conditions.

Proposed changes to Medicare Advantage

In 2018, the Trump administration proposed changes to Medicare Advantage that would have allowed insurers to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with certain conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. While the proposal was ultimately withdrawn, critics argued that it would have undermined protections for pre-existing conditions.
In conclusion, despite his claims to the contrary, Trump’s actions during his presidency suggest that he was not a strong supporter of protections for pre-existing conditions. From attempting to repeal the ACA to supporting a lawsuit that would have struck down the law entirely, his policies could have left millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions vulnerable to discrimination by insurers. While the debate over healthcare reform continues, it is important to remember the real-world impact that policy decisions can have on people’s lives.
