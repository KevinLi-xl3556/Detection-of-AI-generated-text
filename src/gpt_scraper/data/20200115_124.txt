Running a marathon for the first time is no easy feat, but the benefits may be even greater than you thought. According to a recent study, running a first marathon may help make your arteries look 4 years younger!
The study, conducted by researchers from University College London, recruited 138 first-time marathon runners aged between 21 and 69. Participants underwent medical assessments before and after they completed the London Marathon. The results showed a significant reduction in blood pressure and artery stiffness, which are both indicators of vascular aging.
In fact, the researchers found that completing a first marathon was associated with a reduction in arterial age by an average of 4 years! This improvement was seen across all age ranges and both sexes.
The findings are significant because arterial stiffness is a known risk factor for heart disease and stroke. By reducing arterial stiffness, marathon running may help prevent these conditions, which are leading causes of death globally.
This study also highlights the importance of exercise in maintaining a healthy heart and cardiovascular system. Even if running a marathon is not on your list of fitness goals, regular physical activity can help keep your arteries flexible and healthy.
Of course, training for and running a marathon is no small feat. It requires dedication, commitment, and a lot of hard work. It’s important to consult with your doctor before embarking on any new exercise regimen, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.
But for those who are up for the challenge, the physical and mental benefits of completing a marathon can be life-changing. Not only can it improve your cardiovascular health, but it can also boost confidence, self-esteem, and overall well-being.
In conclusion, the benefits of running a marathon for the first time may extend beyond just a sense of personal accomplishment. It may help reduce arterial stiffness and make your arteries look 4 years younger, which can have a significant impact on your long-term heart health. So, if you’re up for the challenge, why not lace up your running shoes and go for it?
