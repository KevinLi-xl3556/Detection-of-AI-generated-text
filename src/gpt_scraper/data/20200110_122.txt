Firstly, it’s important to understand why the couple decided to step back. In their statement, they cited their desire to become financially independent and to balance their time between the UK and North America. They also spoke about the intense media scrutiny and the toll it had taken on their mental health and wellbeing.
It’s easy to understand why Harry and Meghan might have felt the need to step back. They were under constant scrutiny from the media, with every aspect of their lives scrutinized and reported on in great detail. This level of attention can be exhausting and stressful, particularly when it involves negative or critical coverage. Additionally, Harry has lived his entire life in the public eye, and it’s possible that he wanted to carve out a more private existence for himself and his family.

Some criticized them for putting their own desires above the needs of the institution and the country they represented. Others saw their decision as a betrayal of the monarchy and an insult to the British people.
It’s important to note that Harry and Meghan’s decision to step back was not without consequences. They were stripped of their royal titles and patronages, and they were no longer able to carry out official duties on behalf of the Queen. However, they have continued to work on causes close to their hearts, such as mental health and gender equality, through their non-profit organization, the Archewell Foundation.
In conclusion, the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family was a bold move that sparked intense debate and speculation. While some people praised their independent spirit and desire for privacy, others criticized them for shirking their duties and betraying the monarchy.
