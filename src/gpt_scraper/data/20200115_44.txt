On the evening of January 14, 2020, two of the frontrunners in the Democratic presidential race, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, participated in the seventh debate hosted by CNN. The debate was held in Des Moines, Iowa, and was the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, which are scheduled for February 3, 2020.
One of the most talked-about moments of the debate was a heated exchange between Warren and Sanders about whether Sanders had told Warren during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Sanders denied making the comment, while Warren insisted that he had.
After the debate ended, a now-famous moment between the two candidates occurred. As the cameras continued to roll, Warren approached Sanders and said, “I think you called me a liar on national TV.” Sanders replied, “You know, let’s not do it right now. If you want to have that discussion, we’ll have that discussion.” Warren then replied, “Anytime.”
The moment was highly scrutinized and analyzed by political commentators and the media, with many debating the veracity of Warren’s claim and Sanders’ denial. Some also criticized Warren for bringing up the issue during the debate, which overshadowed other topics like trade, healthcare, and foreign policy.
The fallout from this exchange continued in the following days, with leaks from the Sanders campaign suggesting that Warren’s team had pre-planned the attack on Sanders. The Sanders campaign also released a statement condemning Warren’s accusation, stating that “It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn’t win.”
Many supporters of Warren and Sanders were left frustrated and divided by the exchange, with some feeling that it was an unnecessary distraction from the issues at hand. However, others argued that the exchange highlighted important issues of gender and electability in politics.
Regardless of one’s personal opinion on the exchange between Warren and Sanders, it sparked important conversations about the role of women in politics and the challenges they face on the path to the presidency. As the race for the Democratic nomination continues, it remains to be seen how this moment will shape the campaigns of both Warren and Sanders, and the future of the Democratic party as a whole.
