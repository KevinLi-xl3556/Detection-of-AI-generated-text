The Brooklyn Nets have had a tumultuous season so far, with injuries and COVID-19 protocols disrupting their lineup on a regular basis. However, just when it seemed like things couldn’t get any worse, the team received a much-needed boost in the form of Caris LeVert.
LeVert, who had been traded to the Indiana Pacers in January as part of the James Harden deal, was dealt a devastating blow in March when he was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, a form of kidney cancer. He underwent successful surgery to remove the cancerous growth, but was forced to sit out the remainder of the season as he recovered.
Fast forward to April, and the Nets found themselves in a precarious position. With star players Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving all sidelined with injuries, the team was struggling to stay afloat in the Eastern Conference playoff race. But just as things were looking bleak, LeVert made a stunning return to the court.
In his first game back, LeVert showed no signs of rust, scoring 13 points and dishing out 7 assists in a crucial victory over the San Antonio Spurs. His presence on the court injected a much-needed energy into the team, and gave Nets fans hope that they could still salvage their season.
LeVert’s return could not have come at a better time, as the Nets are now in the midst of a grueling stretch of games that will likely determine their playoff seeding. With Durant, Harden, and Irving all still sidelined, LeVert will be counted on to carry a significant portion of the scoring load, and his versatility and playmaking ability will be invaluable to a team that is lacking in both areas.
But perhaps more importantly, LeVert’s return serves as a reminder that basketball is just a game, and that there are more important things in life than wins and losses. His battle with cancer was a sobering reminder of the fragility of life, and his resilience and determination in overcoming it serves as an inspiration to all who have faced similar struggles.
As the Nets continue to navigate through the ups and downs of the NBA season, they can take comfort in the fact that they have a warrior like Caris LeVert on their side. His return to the court is a testament to his strength and resilience, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for a brighter tomorrow.
