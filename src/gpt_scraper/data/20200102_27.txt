The recent violence in India has claimed the lives of many people with the Muslim population being the most affected. The situation has led to accusations against the police for continuously abusing Muslims rather than safeguarding them.
The root cause of this violence is the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by the government in 2019. The act allowed non-Muslims who were in India illegally to turn into citizens while excluding Muslims who were in the country under the same status. This move sparked off protests all over the country, most of which turned violent.
The police had the mandate to control these protests but failed to do so. Rather, video recordings show that the police took part in the violence, beating up members of the Muslim community and damaging their property. Several human rights groups have stood up and recorded similar claims, and many question if the police were working on government orders.
In North East Delhi, the violence went on for several days, with the police allegedly not doing anything to protect the Muslim minority. There were instances where the police stood by as mobs destroyed Muslim shops and set fire to homes. There are photographs of Muslim men injured, some appearing to be in police custody, indicating that even those who have not taken part in the protests have also been targeted.
Now, the Delhi Minorities Commission has filed a report against the police, indicating that the police were selective in charging cases against Muslims rather than non-Muslims. Also, there were cases of non-Muslims being allowed to hold protests even after permission is denied. This has led to questions on the police’s partiality in this matter.
There have been calls for an independent committee to investigate the cases against the police in India. Amnesty International has called for a through probe into the allegations of the police’s brutality during the protests. There is also a need for accountability for those who incited and carried out this violence.
Going forward, India must create an environment that safeguards the rights of all its citizens. The government must take responsibility for its role in the deaths and destruction and be accountable for ensuring its citizens’ safety, irrespective of their religion. The police must safeguard the citizens and their properties and not be a part of the violence. The international community must show support and put pressure on India to take the right course of action in this trying time. It is only through collective action that we can overcome such difficult and trying times.
