Gary Starkweather, Inventor of the Laser Printer, Dies at 81
Gary Starkweather, the man known for inventing the laser printer, passed away on December 26, 2019, at the age of 81.
Born in Lansing, Michigan in 1938, Starkweather was a visionary inventor and engineer who had a significant impact on the tech industry. He attended Michigan State University, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Physics in 1960 and a Master’s degree in Optics in 1961.
Starkweather began his career at the Xerox Corporation’s research center in Webster, New York, where he worked as a researcher for several years. In the late 1960s, he had an idea that would go on to revolutionize the printing industry: to use a laser to create high-resolution images on paper.
At the time, printers used a technique called “impact printing,” in which ink was pressed onto paper through a ribbon using striking pins. This method was slow and produced low-quality images. Starkweather believed that using a laser to create an image would be faster and produce higher-quality prints.
Starkweather’s colleagues were initially skeptical of his idea, but he persevered and built a prototype in his spare time. The first laser printer, known as the Xerox 9700, was released in 1977. It was a commercial success and paved the way for laser printers to become a standard in offices around the world.
The impact of Starkweather’s invention cannot be overstated. The laser printer revolutionized the printing industry, and its impact extended far beyond its initial use in offices. It enabled the production of high-quality printed materials on a large scale, from books and newspapers to magazines and brochures.
Starkweather was also a prolific inventor outside of his work at Xerox. He held dozens of patents for other inventions, including a 3D telescope display and a digital camera system for capturing and storing images.
In 1987, Starkweather received the National Medal of Technology from President Ronald Reagan for his groundbreaking work on the laser printer. He retired from Xerox in 1987 but continued to be an active member of the tech industry, serving as a consultant and expert witness in patent cases.
Gary Starkweather’s contributions to the field of printing and technology have had a lasting impact on the world. His legacy will continue to inspire inventors and engineers for generations to come.
