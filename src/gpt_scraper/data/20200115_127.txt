Ingredients
For the Chinese roast pork, you’ll need:

1/4 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons rice wine or dry sherry
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder

For the garlic bread, you’ll need:

1 loaf of crusty bread
1 stick butter, softened
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
Salt and black pepper, to taste

Preparation

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, rice wine, sesame oil, garlic, Chinese five spice powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.
Rub the pork belly with the marinade, making sure to coat it evenly. Let it marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight, if possible.
Place the pork belly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Roast in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until fully cooked. Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

Cut the bread into slices but not all the way through the loaf.
In a bowl, mix together the softened butter, garlic, parsley, salt, and black pepper. Stir until well combined.
Spread the butter mixture in between the slices of the bread.
Wrap the bread in foil and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the butter has melted and the bread is crispy.
