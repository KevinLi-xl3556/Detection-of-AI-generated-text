Virginia’s New Policies
Recently, Virginia’s lawmakers proposed several new policies concerning gun control, education, and healthcare. These policies have sparked heated debates among residents, politicians, and activists alike. One of the most significant proposals is a “red flag” law that allows authorities to temporarily take away someone’s firearms if they’re deemed dangerous or unstable. Another proposal seeks to make Virginia the fourth state to offer free community college to its residents. These policies are just some of the many changes that lawmakers are proposing as Virginia undergoes a political shift.
