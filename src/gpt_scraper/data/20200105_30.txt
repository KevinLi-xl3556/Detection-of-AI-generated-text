Tom Brady’s Last Pass Puts His Patriots Future in Doubt
The New England Patriots were just a few plays away from winning their seventh Super Bowl on Sunday evening. But in the end, it was a fateful throw by quarterback Tom Brady that sealed their fate and put his future with the team in doubt.
With less than two minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots had the ball and a chance to drive down the field for a go-ahead score. But on third down, Brady’s pass was intercepted by Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Brandon Graham, effectively ending New England’s hopes of a comeback.
It was a shocking turn of events for Brady and the Patriots, who had been favored by many to win the game. But what was even more surprising was the realization that this could be Brady’s last pass in a Patriots uniform.
At 40 years old, Brady is undoubtedly one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. He has won five Super Bowls, four Super Bowl MVP awards, and has been selected to 13 Pro Bowls. But as he enters the twilight of his career, questions have arisen about his future with the Patriots.
Brady is set to become a free agent at the end of the 2018 season, and there has been speculation that he may retire or seek a new team. While Patriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have maintained that they want Brady to remain with the team, it remains to be seen if they will be able to come to an agreement on a new contract.
The interception on Sunday was not solely Brady’s fault, of course. He was under pressure from the Eagles’ defense all night and was sacked three times. But it was his costly mistake that sealed the Patriots’ fate and cast doubt on his future with the team.
In the aftermath of the loss, Brady was uncharacteristically emotional during his post-game press conference. He admitted that he was not sure what his future held and that he needed time to process the defeat.
“I mean, it’s a tough loss. You know, tough to lose these games, and to come up short,” Brady said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen next, so we’ll just take it one day at a time.”
For Patriots fans, the prospect of Brady leaving the team is a daunting one. He has been the face of the franchise for nearly two decades and has brought unparalleled success to the organization. But as much as they would like him to stay, the reality is that his time with the Patriots may be coming to an end.
It’s a sobering thought, and one that will take some time for fans to come to terms with. But as they say, all good things must come to an end. And if Sunday’s game was indeed Brady’s last pass in a Patriots uniform, then it was a bittersweet end to an incredible career.
