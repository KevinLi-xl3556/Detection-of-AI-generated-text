In an increasingly divisive world, it’s no secret that places of worship have become targets of violence. Churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples across the globe have been hit by bombings and shootings, leaving congregants and religious leaders feeling vulnerable and afraid.
One church, in particular, has taken it upon itself to prepare for potential attacks. The Agape Bible Church, based in a small town in the Midwest, has created a unique safety plan that involves hurling bibles and hot coffee at any potential intruders.
“I know it might sound crazy,” says Pastor Mike, the leader of the Agape Bible Church, “but we’ve seen what’s happening in the world, and we need to make sure our congregation is safe.”
The safety plan was actually inspired by a passage in the Bible, where Jesus overturns tables and chases out money changers from the temple. “We figured if it worked for Jesus, it might work for us,” Pastor Mike explains.
The church has installed security cameras and trained a team of volunteers to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity. But if an intruder manages to make it inside the church, the plan goes into action.
“We have a bin of bibles at the back of the church, and we encourage our congregation to grab one if they see an intruder,” Pastor Mike says. “And if they get close enough, we tell them to throw it as hard as they can.”
In addition to bibles, the church has also stockpiled hot coffee in the event of an attack. “It’s not like we’re throwing scalding lava or anything,” Pastor Mike clarifies. “But a hot cup of coffee in the face can be a great deterrent.”
The safety plan has garnered attention from other churches and religious institutions, some of which are considering adopting similar measures.
Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential danger of inciting violence, as well as the legality of hurling bibles and hot coffee at intruders.
But Pastor Mike remains steadfast in his belief that the safety of his congregation comes first. “We’d rather be safe than sorry,” he says. “And if throwing a bible or a cup of coffee can save even one life, it’s worth it.”
While it’s still uncertain whether the Agape Bible Church’s safety plan will be effective in a real-life attack, the dedication to protecting its congregation is commendable. It’s a sad reality that places of worship need to prepare for violence, but with creative solutions like this, perhaps we can make them safer for all.
