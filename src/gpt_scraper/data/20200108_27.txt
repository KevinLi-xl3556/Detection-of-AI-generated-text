Elizabeth Wurtzel Was a Great Writer and a Better Friend
Elizabeth Wurtzel was a celebrated writer, known for her searingly honest memoirs and essays that explored themes of mental illness, addiction, and the complexities of being a woman in modern society. She passed away on January 7th, 2020 at the age of 52 due to complications from breast cancer. While her writing will continue to be admired and analyzed for years to come, it’s worth remembering that Elizabeth was also an incredible friend.
Elizabeth had a larger-than-life personality that could sometimes be overwhelming, but she was also incredibly loyal and generous to those she cared about. She had a close circle of friends who supported each other through life’s ups and downs, and she was always willing to lend a sympathetic ear or offer a shoulder to cry on.
One of Elizabeth’s closest friends was Nina Collins, who wrote a moving tribute to her after her passing. In the piece, Nina describes how Elizabeth was always there for her during some of the most difficult times in her life, including the death of her father and her own struggles with addiction. Elizabeth was a constant source of support and encouragement, and Nina credits her with helping her get sober and stay sober for over a decade.
Another friend of Elizabeth’s, David Samuels, wrote a beautiful essay for The Atlantic about their friendship. David and Elizabeth met when they were both young and starting out in the world of writing, and they quickly became close. He describes how Elizabeth was always willing to read his work and offer feedback, even when she was struggling with her own writing. She was fiercely competitive, but never at the expense of her friendships. David writes, “She was a person of extreme and sometimes unbearable emotions, who could also be a wonderfully warm and generous friend.”
Elizabeth’s generosity extended beyond just her close friends. She was known for offering support and encouragement to other writers, particularly women, who were just starting out. She wrote essays and book reviews championing the work of up-and-coming writers, and she was always willing to share her platform to help amplify their voices.
Despite her many accomplishments, Elizabeth never lost sight of what was truly important to her: her relationships with the people she loved. She was a devoted daughter, sister, and friend, and she treasured those connections above all else. As Nina Collins wrote in her tribute, “Elizabeth was a great writer, but she was an even better friend.”
In the years since Elizabeth’s passing, her writing has continued to resonate with readers who appreciate her raw honesty and willingness to confront difficult topics. But it’s worth remembering that behind the words was a woman who cared deeply about the people in her life. Elizabeth Wurtzel was a great writer, but she was also a true friend.
