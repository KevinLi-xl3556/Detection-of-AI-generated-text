The Former Journalist Who Is Bernie Sanders’s Media Critic
Over the last few years, the American political landscape has undergone a drastic change. With new candidates and campaigns emerging every election cycle, the role of media has become increasingly important. In this context, a former journalist named Michael Tracey has emerged as one of the most vocal and consistent media critics of Senator Bernie Sanders.
Tracey, who worked for a number of liberal media outlets like The Young Turks and Vice News, originally gained notoriety for his coverage of the 2016 Democratic primary. While Sanders was running against Hillary Clinton, Tracey became a frequent guest on news programs, offering his critiques of the mainstream media’s coverage of the race.
Since then, Tracey has continued to be an outspoken critic of the media industry more broadly. However, his focus has primarily been on Sanders and his supporters. Tracey has criticized the mainstream media’s coverage of Sanders, arguing that they are biased against him and are unfairly dismissive of his policy proposals.
According to Tracey, journalism has become less about informing the public and more about reinforcing existing biases and narratives. He believes that the media has become too cozy with the political establishment, and that this relationship has created a “bubble” that is out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans.
Tracey has also been skeptical of some of the claims made by Sanders and his supporters, particularly those related to the alleged bias of the media. While he acknowledges that there are certainly instances of media bias, he argues that this is not the primary obstacle to Sanders’s success. Instead, he believes that the senator’s rhetoric has alienated many moderate Democrats, as well as independent and swing voters.
Despite his criticisms, Tracey remains a committed supporter of Sanders and his progressive agenda. He has argued that Sanders’s message resonates with many Americans who are fed up with the political establishment and are looking for a new direction. However, he has also been critical of some of Sanders’s tactics and messaging strategies, suggesting that the senator’s team could benefit from a more nuanced and strategic approach to media relations.
As the 2020 election approaches, it remains to be seen how Tracey’s critiques will influence the media’s treatment of Sanders and his campaign. However, his outspokenness and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom make him an important voice in the ongoing debate over the role of media in American politics.
