Morris was a highly regarded biographer who wrote extensively about influential women in American politics and society. Her work on Clare Boothe Luce was widely regarded as a masterful and comprehensive portrayal of one of the most fascinating figures of the 20th century.
Clare Boothe Luce was a writer, editor, actress, and politician who rose to prominence during the 1930s and 1940s. She was a noted figure in New York society and was married to the publishing magnate Henry Luce, the founder of Time magazine.

In her biography of Luce, Morris provided a detailed and nuanced portrayal of the complex and often contradictory figure. She drew upon extensive research and interviews with Luce’s family, friends, and colleagues to present a vivid and compelling picture of a woman who defied conventional expectations and blazed her own trail in a male-dominated world.

In addition to her work on Luce, Morris also wrote biographies of other influential women, including Edith Roosevelt, the wife of President Theodore Roosevelt, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
Morris was born in England in 1939 and spent much of her early life in Australia. She later moved to the United States and earned a Ph.D. in English literature from Columbia University. She taught at several universities and was a fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities.
Throughout her career, Morris was recognized for her contributions to the field of biography. She was awarded the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography and the Plutarch Award for Best Biography in 1998 for “Rage for Fame.” She was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Biography in 2015 for “Price of Fame.”
