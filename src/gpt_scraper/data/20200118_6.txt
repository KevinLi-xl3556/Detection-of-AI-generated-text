Putin the Immortal: Myths and Realities of the Russian President’s Reign
Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia for more than two decades, longer than any other leader since Stalin. During this time, he has faced numerous challenges, from a failing economy and domestic unrest to geopolitical rivalries and international sanctions. Yet, he has managed to maintain his grip on power, reshaping the country’s political and social landscape in his image. Some people see Putin as a hero, a patriot, and a savior of Russia, while others see him as a villain, a dictator, and a threat to democracy. However, one thing is certain: Putin has become an iconic figure, both inside and outside Russia, and his influence is likely to endure for years to come.
But what makes Putin so special? Why does he seem to defy the laws of political gravity, surviving one crisis after another, while other leaders falter or fall? Some observers attribute this phenomenon to Putin’s cunning, his mastery of propaganda, and his ruthlessness. They see him as a Machiavellian manipulator, who controls the media, the security forces, and the oligarchs, and who uses fear, coercion, and deception to maintain his rule. They also point to Putin’s personal charisma, his athleticism, and his masculine image, which resonate with many Russians, especially older and conservative ones, who long for stability, order, and strength.
Other analysts argue that Putin’s success is due to Russia’s historical and cultural legacy, which favors strong and centralized leadership, as well as to global trends, such as the decline of Western liberalism and the rise of authoritarian populism. They see Putin as a product of his times, a leader who adapts to changing circumstances and exploits new opportunities, such as the annexation of Crimea, the intervention in Syria, and the cultivation of ties with China and other non-Western powers. They also note that Putin has benefited from luck, including the high oil prices that fueled Russia’s growth in the 2000s and the weak opposition that failed to challenge him effectively.
However, there is another explanation for Putin’s longevity, which may surprise some people: he is not immortal, but he is a survivor. Putin may have many flaws and limitations as a leader, but he has a remarkable ability to learn from his mistakes, to improvise under pressure, and to adapt to changing circumstances. He also has a keen sense of pragmatism and realism, which prevents him from pursuing unrealistic or ideologically driven goals. For example, Putin did not try to revive the Soviet Union or to impose communism on Russia; instead, he sought to modernize and strengthen the country’s economy, infrastructure, and military, while preserving its distinct identity and culture.
Moreover, Putin has demonstrated a rare skill in balancing competing interests and factions, both within and outside Russia. He has managed to appease the nationalists, the conservatives, and the communists, while also engaging with the liberals, the technocrats, and the business elites. He has forged alliances with the regional governors, the security chiefs, and the industrial barons, while also keeping the media, the opposition, and the civil society under control. He has played a key role in global affairs, such as the negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal, the management of the Syrian crisis, and the shaping of the multipolar world order; yet, he has also avoided direct confrontation with the United States and other major powers, despite the tensions and the conflicts.
Of course, Putin is not invincible, and his regime faces many challenges and risks, both from within and from without. The COVID-19 pandemic, the slump in oil prices, the demographic decline, and the environmental degradation are among the formidable obstacles that Russia must overcome. The infighting among the elites, the corruption, the social inequalities, and the human rights abuses are among the urgent issues that Putin must address. The geopolitical rivalries, the arms races, and the global crises are among the unpredictable factors that Putin must navigate.
Yet, for now, Putin is still in power, and he seems to be in control. He has just won another constitutional referendum, which could allow him to stay in office until 2036, when he will be 84 years old. Putin may not be immortal, but he is certainly a legend in his own time, a complex and enigmatic figure who embodies Russia’s past, present, and future, for better or for worse. As Putin once said, “Power is something that has to be shown, not talked about.” With Putin, we have seen both.
