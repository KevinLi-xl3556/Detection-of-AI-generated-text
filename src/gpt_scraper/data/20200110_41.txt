When Pete Buttigieg announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, he surprised many with his outspoken embrace of religion. As an openly gay man, Buttigieg has been subject to scrutiny from both religious and non-religious voters. But rather than shy away from his faith, he has made it a central part of his campaign.
Buttigieg, who served as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for two terms before running for president, has described himself as a “traditional Episcopalian.” He has cited his faith as the driving force behind his political beliefs, saying that he believes that “being a good Christian means caring for the least among us.” He has also spoken about the role of faith in his personal life, describing how it helped him come to terms with his sexuality.
Buttigieg’s embrace of religion has drawn attention from across the political spectrum. Some have applauded his willingness to speak openly about his faith, while others have questioned his sincerity. In a 2019 interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Buttigieg responded to criticism that he was using his religion as a political tool, saying that “the worst thing you can do with faith is use it to divide people.”
Despite this criticism, Buttigieg has continued to make religion a central part of his campaign. He has spoken at length about the importance of values such as compassion, humility, and service, which he sees as central to his Christian faith. He has also called on other Christians to recognize the importance of fighting against inequality and injustice.
One of Buttigieg’s most notable speeches on religion came during a CNN town hall in April 2019, when he responded to a question about Vice President Mike Pence’s opposition to same-sex marriage. Buttigieg, who has been married to his husband, Chasten, since 2018, said that he wished Pence “would understand that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
Buttigieg’s embrace of religion has not been limited to Christian beliefs. In an interview with Religion News Service in 2019, he expressed admiration for the teachings of the Dalai Lama and the Buddhist concept of “interdependence.” He has also spoken about his admiration for the religious pluralism of his hometown, which has a significant Muslim population.
In making religion central to his campaign, Buttigieg has positioned himself as a candidate who is not afraid to grapple with difficult questions about faith and politics. He has sought to challenge the idea that there is a fundamental divide between religious and secular Americans, arguing that both groups can share common values and work together for the common good.
While it remains to be seen whether Buttigieg’s embrace of religion will ultimately help or hurt his political ambitions, his willingness to engage with faith in a thoughtful and nuanced way has certainly made him a unique figure in American politics. As the 2020 presidential race continues to unfold, it will be interesting to see how Buttigieg’s religious beliefs continue to shape his campaign and his vision for America’s future.
