In the aftermath of the devastating bushfires that swept through Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, the country’s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has called for an inquiry into the government’s response to the disaster.
The fires, which burned across an area of more than 10 million hectares, destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 34 people. They were fueled by a combination of record-breaking temperatures, drought, and strong winds, and were made worse by years of inadequate land management practices and climate change.
The response of the Australian government to the crisis was widely criticized, with many people accusing the government of failing to adequately prepare for the disaster and respond quickly enough to the crisis as it unfolded.
In a statement released on Monday, Morrison said that he had asked the governor-general to establish a royal commission, a type of public inquiry, into the bushfires. The inquiry will investigate the government’s response to the disaster, as well as the country’s overall preparedness for future emergencies.
“We owe it to the Australian people, particularly those who lost loved ones, those who lost homes, those who suffered in any way as a result of these terrible bushfires, to learn the lessons from what has happened,” Morrison said.
The inquiry will have broad powers to investigate the causes of the bushfires, the government’s response, and the role of different agencies in the response. It will also examine the effectiveness of Australia’s emergency management systems and procedures and make recommendations for how these can be improved in the future.
Morrison said that he hoped the inquiry would help to provide a “pathway forward” for the country, as it grapples with the aftermath of the bushfires and the ongoing challenge of climate change.
“We must continue to take action on climate change and reduce emissions, but we also need to be better prepared for future disasters,” he said.
The announcement of the inquiry was welcomed by many Australians, who have been calling for greater accountability and transparency from the government in the wake of the bushfires.
However, some critics have expressed concern that the inquiry may not go far enough in addressing the root causes of the bushfires, particularly the role of climate change and the government’s inaction on the issue.
“An inquiry into the government’s response to the bushfires is a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough,” said Kelly O’Shanassy, CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation. “We need urgent action on climate change to prevent future disasters like this from happening.”
Despite these concerns, the inquiry represents an important step forward for Australia as it seeks to come to terms with the unprecedented scale of the bushfire crisis. By shining a light on the government’s response to the disaster, the inquiry has the potential to provide much-needed answers and accountability for those affected by the bushfires, and to help the country better prepare for future emergencies.
