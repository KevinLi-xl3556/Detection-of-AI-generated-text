Why Trump’s Threadbare Legal Argument Will Probably Work
Since his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, former President Donald J. Trump has been relentless in his efforts to challenge the outcome through legal means. Despite multiple failed attempts and a lack of evidence to support his claims of widespread voter fraud, Trump’s legal team has continued to pursue various legal avenues in an attempt to overturn the election results. While many legal experts and pundits have dismissed Trump’s efforts as baseless and doomed to fail, there are reasons to believe that his threadbare legal argument may actually work.
One of the key factors working in Trump’s favor is the partisan makeup of the judiciary. During his term in office, Trump was able to appoint and confirm numerous conservative judges to the federal bench, including three justices to the Supreme Court. These judges are often seen as sympathetic to Trump’s political agenda, and there is a perception among some legal scholars that they may be more inclined to interpret the law in a way that favors Trump and his supporters. This has led to speculation that if Trump’s legal challenges reach the Supreme Court, he may find a more receptive audience for his arguments.
Another factor that could work in Trump’s favor is the concept of “judicial deference.” This principle holds that courts should generally defer to the decisions of elected officials and other branches of government, particularly on matters of policy or political controversy. While this principle is not absolute and is subject to various exceptions and limitations, it could potentially provide Trump with a legal basis for challenging the election results. Trump’s legal team has argued that state officials and courts exceeded their authority in changing voting procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that these changes resulted in widespread voter fraud. While many legal experts have dismissed these arguments as flimsy and without merit, there is a possibility that some courts, particularly those with conservative judges, may be more inclined to give Trump the benefit of the doubt and defer to his claims.
Additionally, Trump’s legal team has been persistent in their efforts to challenge the election results, filing numerous lawsuits and appeals in multiple states. While most of these lawsuits have been dismissed for lack of evidence or procedural grounds, Trump’s legal team has continued to appeal these decisions and seek further review. This persistent legal strategy could potentially pay off, as it could result in the case reaching higher courts with more sympathetic judges or could create a sense of confusion or doubt about the legitimacy of the election results in the minds of some members of the public.
Furthermore, Trump has a large and devoted base of supporters who believe in his claims of election fraud and are willing to support him through various means, including financially. Trump’s legal team has been able to raise significant sums of money through fundraising efforts to finance their legal challenges, which has allowed them to hire top-notch legal talent and mount a robust legal campaign. This financial backing has enabled Trump’s legal team to keep their legal challenges alive and pursue multiple avenues of litigation, increasing the chances that they may find a legal argument that gains traction in court.
It’s important to note that while Trump’s legal arguments may be threadbare in terms of evidence and legal precedent, they may still have political and public relations value. Trump has been able to galvanize his base of supporters around his claims of election fraud, and his legal challenges have served to perpetuate the perception among his followers that the election was stolen from him. This has resulted in a significant portion of the American public continuing to harbor doubts about the legitimacy of President Joe Biden’s victory, and it has contributed to the ongoing polarization and division in the country.
In conclusion, while Trump’s legal arguments challenging the 2020 election results may be weak in terms of legal merit, there are factors that could work in his favor. The partisan makeup of the judiciary, the principle of judicial defer
