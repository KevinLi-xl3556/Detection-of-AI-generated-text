As the 2020 Democratic Presidential nomination race heats up, tensions are once again rising between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Clinton recently made headlines with her comments about Sanders in the new documentary ‘Hillary’ by saying “Nobody likes him. Nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done.” This sparked a heated debate among Democrats and raised questions about whether Clinton’s comments would cause a party split over Sanders.
Clinton’s comments come at a time when Sanders is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, and many believe that he has a strong chance of taking on President Trump in November. Bernie Sanders himself responded to the comments saying, “On a good day, my wife likes me, so let’s clear the air on that one,” showing a sense of humor when many people would have retaliated vehemently.
Sanders has been a longstanding critic of establishment politics and Clinton, often referring to her as part of the political elite and criticizing her for being too close to Wall Street. In 2016, Sanders and Clinton battled fiercely for the Democratic nomination, with the Vermont Senator eventually conceding to Clinton after a contentious primary campaign.
Despite his loss to Clinton, Sanders has continued to build a grassroots movement and gain the support of young and progressive voters. Many believe that his ideas, including universal healthcare and free college education, align with the values of the Democratic Party and are a unique voice in American politics.
Clinton’s comments about Sanders have caused some backlash among Democrats, with many criticizing her for undermining a fellow party member during a critical election cycle. Some worry that her comments may push Sanders’ supporters further away from the Democratic Party and damage the chance of defeating Donald Trump in November.
While it is not yet clear how the situation will play out, it is clear that the Democratic Party is divided. On one side, there are the establishment Democrats who often back a more moderate candidate, and on the other side, there are the progressives who support Sanders’ more radical vision for the future.
As the Democratic nomination race continues to unfold, it is essential to remember that the party must stay united to have the best chance of defeating Trump in November. While disagreements and conflicts among individuals are inevitable, the democratic candidate must have the unyielding support of the party to win. Hillary Clinton’s comments have created a divide and have certainly not helped the cause in choosing a candidate with a strong chance of winning the nomination and the presidency.
