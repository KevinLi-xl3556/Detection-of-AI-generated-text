In the aftermath of the devastating bushfires that ravaged Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, the country has been embroiled in a heated debate about the causes and appropriate responses to the disaster. One influential figure who has been shaping this debate is media mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose media empire includes some of Australia’s most widely-read newspapers and news outlets.
Murdoch’s News Corp Australia controls a vast swath of the country’s media landscape, with newspapers such as The Australian, The Daily Telegraph, and The Herald Sun, as well as television channels such as Sky News Australia. In the wake of the bushfires, these outlets have been accused of downplaying the role of climate change in the disaster, and instead promoting a narrative that focuses on arson and “green tape” regulations as the primary culprits.
Critics argue that this framing of the bushfires is deeply misleading and ignores the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is a major contributing factor. A report by the Climate Council, an independent non-profit organization, found that climate change has exacerbated the conditions that lead to bushfires, including hotter and drier weather and more frequent heatwaves.
Despite this evidence, News Corp’s coverage has consistently emphasized other factors, particularly arson. The company’s newspapers have run numerous stories about individuals being arrested for deliberately starting fires, often accompanied by provocative headlines and sensationalist language. While arson certainly plays a role in some bushfires, experts point out that it is a relatively minor factor compared to climate change and other systemic issues.
Murdoch’s influence over Australia’s political landscape is well-known, with his media outlets frequently backing conservative politicians and causes. This has led to accusations that the company’s coverage of the bushfires is politically motivated, aimed at protecting the interests of fossil fuel companies and other industries that contribute to climate change. Murdoch himself has been a vocal climate change skeptic in the past, and has been accused of using his media outlets to promote this view.
The impact of News Corp’s coverage on the bushfire debate cannot be understated. The company’s newspapers and websites have a combined daily readership of over 16 million, giving them a significant reach and influence over public opinion. This has led to concerns that the company’s coverage is contributing to a dangerous lack of understanding about the real causes of the bushfires, and hindering efforts to address the underlying issues.
Despite these criticisms, News Corp Australia has defended its coverage of the bushfires, arguing that it is important to consider all factors that contribute to the disaster. In a statement, the company said that “our coverage of the bushfires has been comprehensive and informative, and has sought to provide a range of perspectives on this complex issue.”
The debate over the bushfires in Australia is likely to continue for some time, as the country grapples with the aftermath of one of its worst natural disasters in living memory. However, it is clear that the role of Rupert Murdoch and his media empire will remain a key point of contention, with many Australians calling for greater transparency and accountability in the country’s media landscape.
