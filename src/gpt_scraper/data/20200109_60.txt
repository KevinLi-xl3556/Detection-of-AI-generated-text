Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has been making headlines ever since he decided to step back from his duties as a senior member of the British royal family. While much has been written about his decision to move to the United States with his wife Meghan Markle and their son Archie, one aspect that has received less attention is his real declaration of independence – from Britain’s tabloids.
For years, Prince Harry has been the target of intense media scrutiny, particularly from the tabloid press. From his teenage years, he was constantly followed by paparazzi and had his every move documented in the press. This level of scrutiny only intensified when he began dating Meghan Markle, an American actress, and reached fever pitch after their wedding in 2018.
The tabloids were relentless in their coverage of the couple, printing invasive stories about everything from their relationship to their private lives. They even went so far as to publish a letter that Meghan had written to her estranged father, leading to a legal battle that is still ongoing.
In January 2020, the couple announced their intention to step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family and to become financially independent. This decision was met with mixed reactions, with some praising their desire for a more private life and others criticizing them for abandoning their duties.
However, what many people failed to realize was that Prince Harry’s decision was not just about his desire for financial independence. It was also a declaration of independence from Britain’s tabloid press. In their statement announcing their decision, the couple wrote that they would be stepping back from their “current media relations” and would be engaging with “grassroots media organizations and young, up-and-coming journalists” instead.
This was a clear signal that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were no longer willing to engage with the British tabloids that had hounded them for years. Instead, they were choosing to work with a different kind of media, one that was more focused on positive and constructive stories.
Since moving to the United States, the couple has continued to distance themselves from the British tabloids. They have given interviews to American media outlets such as Oprah Winfrey and TIME magazine, but have largely avoided the British press.
While some may argue that the couple’s decision to distance themselves from the British tabloids is a sign of weakness or a lack of accountability, it is actually a bold move that shows their commitment to creating a more positive media environment. By choosing to work with grassroots media organizations and young journalists, they are helping to create opportunities for a new generation of journalists who are committed to telling positive and constructive stories.
In the end, Prince Harry’s real declaration of independence is not just about his desire for financial freedom. It is also a rejection of the toxic media culture that has plagued Britain for years. By choosing to work with a different kind of media, he and Meghan Markle are leading the way towards a more positive and constructive future.
