Military Kids Change School Up to 9 Times. So Let’s Make It Easier.
Children of military families often face unique challenges that can have a profound impact on their education. One of the biggest challenges is the frequent moves that come with having a parent in the military. These moves can mean changing schools up to nine times over the course of a child’s K-12 education. This can be a major disruption to a child’s academic progress and can make it difficult to establish social connections.
Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to make the transition easier for military children and their families. In this article, we’ll explore some of the challenges that military children face when changing schools and discuss ways to support these students.
The Challenges of Changing Schools
For many military children, changing schools is a fact of life. The average military family moves every two to three years, which means that children may attend as many as nine different schools before graduating from high school. These moves can be stressful and disruptive for children, especially if they are leaving behind close friends and familiar surroundings.
In addition to the emotional challenges, changing schools can also have a negative impact on a child’s academic progress. Children who change schools frequently may miss important material or be unable to catch up to their new classmates. They may also struggle to adjust to new curriculums, teaching styles, and expectations.
Making the Transition Easier
There are a number of steps that can be taken to make the transition to a new school easier for military children. These include:


Providing academic support: Schools can offer extra help to military children who are struggling to keep up with their studies. This might include tutoring, mentoring, or after-school programs.


Offering counseling services: Moving can be stressful for children, and it’s important to provide support for their emotional well-being. Schools can offer counseling services to help children cope with the stress of changing schools.


Establishing a buddy system: Pairing new students with a “buddy” can help them feel more welcome and connected to their new school. Buddies can help new students navigate the school, make friends, and adjust to their new environment.


Creating a military support network: Schools can work with military families to establish a support network that provides information, resources, and assistance to military children and their families.


Providing information about the new school: Before a child moves to a new school, it’s important to provide them with as much information as possible about the school and the surrounding area. This might include information about the school’s curriculum, extracurricular activities, and sports programs, as well as information about the community and local resources.


Conclusion
Military children face unique challenges when it comes to their education, and changing schools is one of the biggest challenges they face. However, by providing academic and emotional support, establishing a buddy system, and creating a military support network, schools can help make the transition to a new school easier for these students. By working together, we can ensure that military children receive the education and support they need to thrive, no matter where they go.
