The world of opera is known for its drama, passion, and intensity. But what happens when the news of the day upstages a performance? In recent years, this has become an increasingly common occurrence, with everything from protests to natural disasters disrupting opera performances around the world.
There is no denying that opera has always been a reflection of the times in which it is performed. From Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro,” which satirized the class system of 18th-century Europe, to John Adams’ “The Death of Klinghoffer,” which dealt with the contemporary issue of terrorism, opera has never shied away from tackling the big issues of the day.
But what happens when those issues hit too close to home? Take, for example, the performance of Verdi’s “La Traviata” at Milan’s Teatro alla Scala in 2014. The opera was interrupted by protesters, who were demonstrating against the proposed closure of a factory in the city. The cast and crew were forced to pause the performance while the protesters were removed from the auditorium.
Similarly, in 2017, a performance of Rossini’s “Guillaume Tell” at the Bastille Opera in Paris was interrupted by members of the orchestra, who were protesting against proposed cuts to their budget. The performance was halted for several minutes while the protesters made their voices heard.
And then there are the natural disasters that have disrupted opera performances around the world. In 2011, a performance of Verdi’s “Rigoletto” at the Royal Opera House in London was cancelled due to heavy snowfall. In 2018, a performance of Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly” at the Sydney Opera House was interrupted by a severe thunderstorm, which caused a power outage.
Of course, it’s not just political protests and natural disasters that can upstage an opera performance. In 2015, a performance of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany was interrupted by a mobile phone ringing in the audience. The conductor, Christian Thielemann, stopped the performance and refused to continue until the phone was turned off.
So what can be done to prevent news events from upstaging opera performances? Some opera companies have begun to take proactive measures, such as scheduling performances earlier in the day to avoid potential protests or cancelling performances in advance if severe weather is predicted.
But ultimately, the very nature of opera means that it will always be vulnerable to outside events. As long as opera continues to engage with the big issues of the day, it will always be at risk of being disrupted by those same issues.
Perhaps, then, the best approach is to embrace the unexpected. After all, as the saying goes, “the show must go on.” When faced with disruption, the cast and crew of an opera have the opportunity to demonstrate their professionalism and adaptability, turning an unexpected interruption into an unforgettable performance. And for the audience, the experience of witnessing an opera in the midst of a chaotic and unpredictable world is a reminder of the power and relevance of this timeless art form.
