Coyotes are a common sight in many urban areas, and while these creatures are typically not aggressive towards humans, attacks by urban coyotes do occasionally occur. While such attacks are rare, they can be frightening and leave people wondering what they should do to protect themselves.
In recent years, there has been an increase in reports of coyote attacks in urban areas across North America. Many experts believe that this increase is due in part to the fact that coyotes are adapting to life in urban environments, where they have access to an abundance of food and shelter.
Despite this increase in reports of attacks, however, the overall risk of being attacked by a coyote is still very low. In fact, experts estimate that there are only a handful of attacks on humans by coyotes each year.
That being said, it is important for people to take precautions when in areas where coyotes are known to be present. This can include keeping pets on a leash, keeping garbage cans securely closed, and not leaving food or water outside.
If you do encounter a coyote, it is important to remember that these animals are generally afraid of humans and will typically try to avoid contact. If a coyote does approach you, it is important to make yourself look as large and intimidating as possible. This can be done by standing up straight, waving your arms, and shouting loudly.
In the rare event that a coyote does attack, it is important to fight back with whatever means possible. This can include throwing rocks or sticks, using pepper spray, or even using physical force.
While attacks by urban coyotes are rare, they can be frightening and leave people feeling vulnerable. By taking precautions and knowing how to respond in the event of an attack, however, people can reduce their risk of being harmed by these animals.
