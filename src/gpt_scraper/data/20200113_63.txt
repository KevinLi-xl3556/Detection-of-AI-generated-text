In 2019, California made history by becoming the first state to allow college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL). This groundbreaking move sparked a wave of similar initiatives across the country, as statehouses pushed to expand the rights of college athletes.
The California law, known as the Fair Pay to Play Act, paved the way for athletes to sign contracts, licensing agreements, and other deals that would allow them to earn money from their athletic abilities. The move came after years of debate over the NCAA’s amateurism model, which limits the financial benefits that college athletes can receive.
The Fair Pay to Play Act was signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom on September 30, 2019, and is set to take effect in 2023. However, other states have not waited for California to take action. In fact, several states have already passed their own NIL laws, with others in the process of doing so.
One such state is Florida, which passed its own NIL law in June 2020. The Florida law is set to take effect in July 2021, a full two years ahead of California’s law. The Florida law is seen as particularly significant because it includes provisions that prevent colleges and universities from penalizing athletes who choose to monetize their NIL.
Other states that have passed or are in the process of passing NIL laws include Colorado, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Maryland. All of these states have cited California’s law as a key influence in their decision to take action.
The push to expand the rights of college athletes has also gained traction at the national level. In December 2020, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the College Athlete Bill of Rights, which would provide college athletes with a range of new rights and protections.
The bill includes provisions that would allow athletes to earn money from their NIL, as well as new health and safety protections, guaranteed scholarships, and the ability to transfer schools without penalty. While the bill has yet to be formally introduced in Congress, it has already received widespread support from athletes, coaches, and advocacy groups.
The move to expand the rights of college athletes has not been without its detractors, however. Some critics argue that allowing athletes to profit from their athletic abilities would jeopardize the amateurism model that has long been a hallmark of college sports.
Others worry that the new laws could create an uneven playing field, with athletes at larger schools and in more popular sports benefiting more than those at smaller schools or in less popular sports.
Despite these concerns, it is clear that the push to expand the rights of college athletes is gaining steam. With California leading the way and other states following suit, it seems likely that college sports will look very different in the years to come. Whether this change will be for the better or worse, only time will tell.
