In a shocking incident, two children in Milwaukee were shot after they allegedly threw snowballs at passing cars. According to the police, the incident occurred on a cold winter evening when a group of children were playing in the snow in the neighborhood.
Eyewitnesses reported that the children were throwing snowballs at passing cars when one of the drivers got out of his car and fired shots at them. Two of the children, aged 12 and 13, were hit and sustained serious injuries.
The incident has sparked outrage in the community, with many people expressing their shock and anger at the senseless act of violence. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett condemned the shooting and called for justice for the victims.
“This is an unacceptable act of violence against children who were simply playing outside on a winter evening,” Mayor Barrett said in a statement. “We will do everything in our power to bring the perpetrator to justice and ensure that our neighborhoods are safe for all residents, especially our children.”
The police have launched an investigation into the incident and are currently searching for the shooter. They have urged anyone with information to come forward and assist with the investigation.
The incident has also raised concerns about gun violence in Milwaukee, which has been plagued by high rates of gun-related crimes in recent years. According to a report by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the city recorded over 2,400 shootings in 2020, an increase of more than 100% compared to the previous year.
Community leaders have called for more action to address the root causes of gun violence, such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and systemic racism.
“We cannot continue to accept gun violence as a norm in our community,” said Tony Kearney, Executive Director of the Milwaukee chapter of the advocacy group 50 Miles More. “We need to address the root causes of violence and invest in our communities so that our children can grow up in safe and thriving neighborhoods.”
The shooting of the two children has also led to calls for stricter gun control measures in Wisconsin and across the country. Many advocates have pointed to the need for universal background checks, stronger red flag laws, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
The incident has shocked the community and highlighted the urgent need for action to address gun violence in Milwaukee and across the United States. As the investigation continues, many are calling for justice for the victims and a renewed commitment to building safer and more equitable communities for all.
