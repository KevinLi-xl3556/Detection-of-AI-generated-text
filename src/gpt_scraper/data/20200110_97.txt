In the heart of New York City, there is a bar that has stood the test of time for over 190 years. It’s called McSorley’s Old Ale House, and it may just be the most famous bar that you’ve never heard of.
Founded in 1854 by an Irish immigrant named John McSorley, the bar quickly became a favorite among working-class New Yorkers. McSorley’s was known for its cheap ale, classic decor, and friendly atmosphere. The walls were adorned with photos of famous patrons, including Abraham Lincoln, who allegedly visited the bar in 1860.
Over the years, the bar survived Prohibition, the Great Depression, and various ownership changes. But in the late 20th century, McSorley’s faced a new threat: gentrification. As the East Village neighborhood around the bar became trendier, some feared that McSorley’s would be forced to close its doors for good.
Thankfully, that never happened. McSorley’s continued to attract a loyal following of locals, tourists, and celebrities alike. The bar’s historic charm remained untouched, with its sawdust-covered floors, potbellied stove, and 19th-century gas lamps still in place.
In recent years, McSorley’s has even embraced its status as a hidden gem. The bar’s website proudly proclaims it as “the oldest continuously operated saloon in New York City.” In 2018, McSorley’s was even the subject of a documentary film called “The Old House.”
But perhaps the greatest testament to McSorley’s enduring popularity and cultural significance is its inclusion in literature and film. The bar has been referenced in works by everyone from Joseph Mitchell to E.E. Cummings to James Joyce. It even appeared in a scene from the hit TV show “Mad Men.”
As McSorley’s celebrates its 190th year in operation, it’s clear that the bar is more than just a watering hole. It’s a living piece of New York City history, a beloved institution that has withstood the test of time. And despite being the “most famous bar” that many people have never heard of, McSorley’s will likely continue to serve up its famous ales for generations to come.
