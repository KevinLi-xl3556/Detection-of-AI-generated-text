The Warren-Sanders feud has been making headlines for the past few days. The two progressive presidential candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, have been trading barbs in the media, in what seems to be a war of words.
Late night talk show hosts have had a field day with this story, adding their own comedic take on the situation. Here’s a roundup of some of the best late night takes on the Warren-Sanders war of words.
Stephen Colbert, host of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, started off his monologue by saying: “You know, I didn’t think the tension between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would get this bad. I mean, it’s not like they’re both running for the same job or anything.” Colbert then went on to play a clip of Sanders denying that he told Warren in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Colbert responded, “so we’re expected to believe that Bernie Sanders, who has been championing women’s rights for decades, would say something like that…right before he put on his mansplaining cape and flew away?”
Jimmy Kimmel, host of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, took a different approach to the story. He began by saying: “so we’re talking about the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren confrontation, and I’m like, I’m sorry, but what’s wrong with these people? Can’t they just hug it out? Sanders then goes on to deny the allegations and everything goes back to normal, just like when your parents argue over nothing and then kiss and make up.”
Trevor Noah, host of The Daily Show, tackled the situation by saying: “So, we have Elizabeth Warren saying Bernie Sanders told her a woman couldn’t be president, and then Bernie saying he didn’t say it. And you know what makes this whole thing worse? They’re both the only people who know whether he said it or not. It’s like asking a couple who’s fighting whether they love each other. They could be lying or they could be telling the truth, who knows?”
Seth Meyers, host of Late Night with Seth Meyers, addressed the feud in his “Closer Look” segment. He began by saying: “So, the race for the Democratic nomination has finally gotten interesting. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are now at war with each other. A smart person would say the winner of this spat would be whoever walks away with the most progressive support. But since I’m not smart, I’m just hoping for a mud-wrestling match between them.”
While the Warren-Sanders war of words has shaken up the political world, late night hosts have managed to find the humorous side of the story. Their witty and humorous take on the situation has provided some much-needed comic relief during these tense political times.
