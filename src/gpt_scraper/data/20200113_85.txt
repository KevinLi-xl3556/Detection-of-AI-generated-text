Cynthia Erivo: ‘It’s Not Enough That I’m the Only One’
Cynthia Erivo is a British actress, singer, and songwriter who has captured the hearts of audiences all around the world with her powerful performances on stage and screen. She is known for her incredible range and versatility as an artist, but also for her advocacy for diversity and inclusion in the entertainment industry.
Despite the many accolades she has received throughout her career, including a Tony Award for her role in “The Color Purple” on Broadway, Erivo has always been acutely aware of the lack of representation of people of color in the entertainment industry. In a recent interview with The Guardian, she spoke candidly about her experiences as a Black woman in Hollywood and the ongoing struggle for equal opportunities.
“It’s not enough that I’m the only one,” Erivo said. “I want to see more of us. I want to see more of our stories being told. I want to see more diversity in casting and behind the camera. We have to keep pushing for change.”
Erivo’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is not just talk; it is evident in the roles she chooses to play and the projects she takes on. In 2018, she starred in the biopic “Harriet,” which tells the story of Harriet Tubman, an iconic figure in American history who helped slaves escape to freedom via the Underground Railroad. Erivo’s portrayal of Tubman was praised by critics and earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
More recently, Erivo starred in the HBO series “The Outsider,” based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. In the show, Erivo plays Holly Gibney, a private investigator with a unique set of skills who helps solve a string of murders. Erivo’s portrayal of Gibney was praised for its nuance and complexity, and she became the first Black actress to be nominated for a Critics’ Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Limited Series.
Erivo’s success as an actress has not come without its challenges. In the same interview with The Guardian, she spoke about the pressure she feels to represent her entire race and gender, and the constant microaggressions she encounters as a Black woman in Hollywood.
“There are moments when I’ve been in a room with people who don’t look like me, and they don’t quite know how to deal with me,” Erivo said. “They don’t know how to categorize me. They don’t know how to approach me. And it can be uncomfortable.”
Despite the challenges she faces, Erivo remains committed to her craft and to her advocacy for diversity and inclusion in the entertainment industry. She believes that change is possible, but it will require ongoing effort and commitment from everyone involved.
“We have to keep pushing,” Erivo said. “We have to keep telling our stories. We have to keep demanding equal opportunities. We have to keep fighting for representation. It’s not enough that I’m the only one.”
