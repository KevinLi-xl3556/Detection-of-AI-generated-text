As climate change continues to bring about increasingly severe and frequent natural disasters, the world’s coastal cities are rushing to develop new infrastructure that can protect them from rising sea levels and devastating storms.
One of the most ambitious of these projects is the proposed “Big U” sea wall in New York City, which would create a protective ring around Manhattan’s lower half using a combination of landscaped parks, elevated walkways, and flood barriers.
Originally estimated to cost $335 million, the project has since ballooned in scope and price tag, with the latest estimates from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers putting the cost at a staggering $119 billion.
While advocates of the sea wall argue that it is a crucial investment in the city’s future, others have raised concerns that the project may not be worth the immense cost, and could even exacerbate existing inequalities in the city.
One major issue is that the sea wall would largely benefit the wealthiest areas of Manhattan, while neglecting the lower-income neighborhoods that are most vulnerable to flooding and other climate-related disasters. Critics argue that the project would merely reinforce existing patterns of inequality, rather than addressing them in any meaningful way.
Furthermore, some experts have raised doubts about the efficacy of sea walls and other coastal defenses in the face of worsening climate change. As sea levels continue to rise, these defenses may eventually become obsolete or insufficient, leaving cities like New York vulnerable once again.
Ultimately, the decision of whether to move forward with the Big U project is a complex one, involving a balancing of competing interests and priorities. While some argue that the immense cost is worth it, others point out that the money might be better spent on more sustainable, equitable solutions that address the root causes of climate change.
As New York and other coastal cities grapple with these issues, it is clear that the future of urban infrastructure is more uncertain and contingent than ever before. Whether the sea wall ultimately proves to be a success or a failure, its legacy will be a testament to the challenges of anticipating and adapting to an ever-changing world.
