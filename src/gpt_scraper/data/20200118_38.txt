As Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has risen to prominence as a leading Democratic candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election, many have asked the question: Would a 37-year-old woman be where Pete Buttigieg is?
It’s an interesting question, and one that deserves careful consideration. On the one hand, it’s true that women have historically faced unique challenges in American politics. From a lack of representation in Congress to the persistent gender pay gap, women have had to fight hard to overcome the systemic barriers that hinder their success in public life.
At the same time, however, it’s important to remember that women have also made tremendous progress in recent years. In 2019, women made up 23.7% of the United States Congress, the highest percentage in history. And while there is still a long way to go, women are increasingly taking leadership roles in all areas of American society, from business to academia to entertainment.
So would a 37-year-old woman be where Pete Buttigieg is? The answer, ultimately, is that it’s impossible to say for sure. While it’s true that women face unique challenges in politics, there are also countless examples of strong, capable women who have succeeded in spite of those challenges. And while age can certainly be a factor in politics, it’s also true that there have been many young leaders throughout history, male and female alike.
Perhaps, then, the most important question to ask is not whether a 37-year-old woman could be where Pete Buttigieg is, but rather how we as a society can work to create more opportunities and support for women in politics. By challenging the gender norms and biases that have historically held women back, we can create a more equitable and inclusive political system that empowers women to succeed at all levels of government.
In the end, it’s up to all of us to help pave the way for the next generation of leaders, regardless of their gender, age or background. Whether it’s through voting, running for office ourselves or simply supporting the women in our lives who aspire to political leadership, we all have a role to play in creating a brighter, more equitable future for all.
