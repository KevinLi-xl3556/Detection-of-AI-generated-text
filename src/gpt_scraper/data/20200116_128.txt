China and Germany’s relationship has hit a rocky patch, courtesy of Chinese telecom giant, Huawei. The firm’s ongoing ban in the United States has prompted Chinese officials to pressure the German government in various ways, including by targeting its automotive sector.
In a bid to increase pressure on Germany, Chinese officials have threatened to cut off access to the Chinese market for German car manufacturers. Reports suggest that the restrictions could apply to automakers which rely heavily on Chinese components, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler AG.
The message sent by China is clear: If Germany continues to exclude Huawei from its networks, it could face serious economic consequences. China has long been the biggest market for German car manufacturers, and the country’s auto industry is heavily reliant on exports.
The move by China to threaten the German automotive industry comes amid an escalating global trade war between China and the US. Huawei’s ban in the United States has had a significant impact on the company’s profits, and it has resulted in tensions between the US and China that are likely to continue for some time.
In response, Germany has attempted to distance itself from the escalating tensions between the US and China. The German government has refused to outright ban Huawei, instead opting for a more nuanced approach that requires Huawei to meet certain security standards in order to be used in the development of Germany’s 5G network.
Despite these efforts, China’s actions have resulted in concern among Germany’s auto industry. In a statement, Volkswagen AG CEO, Herbert Diess, said that if China were to cut off access to its market, it could result in “a massive crisis for the German economy.”
The emerging situation has put German policymakers in a delicate position. While they want to maintain their relationship with China as a major trading partner, they also need to balance their concerns about national security with the economic interests of the country.
As the situation between China, Huawei, and the US continues to escalate, the fate of the German automotive industry remains uncertain. While Germany has been hesitant to fully embrace Huawei, it is clear that the relationship between the two countries is fraught with tension. The impact of any further actions taken by China could have far-reaching consequences for the German economy, and the global automotive industry as a whole.
