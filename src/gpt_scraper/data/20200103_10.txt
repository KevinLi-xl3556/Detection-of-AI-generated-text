In 2018, the Trump administration proposed a new rule that would exclude climate change from consideration in infrastructure planning. The proposed rule would have significant implications for the nation’s infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public works projects. The rule was met with widespread criticism from environmental groups and advocates for sustainable infrastructure.
The proposed rule would have reversed an Obama-era requirement that federal agencies consider the potential effects of climate change in infrastructure planning. The Obama-era requirement was aimed at ensuring that infrastructure projects were designed and constructed to withstand the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, flooding, and extreme weather events.
The Trump administration argued that the Obama-era requirement was too burdensome and hindered infrastructure development. They claimed that the new rule would streamline the infrastructure planning process and reduce costs.
However, critics of the proposed rule argued that excluding climate change from infrastructure planning was short-sighted and could have long-term negative effects. Climate change is already affecting infrastructure across the country, causing damage to roads, bridges, and other structures. Excluding climate change from consideration could result in infrastructure projects that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as flooding and erosion.
Environmental groups also pointed out that the proposed rule was inconsistent with the Trump administration’s stated goal of promoting economic growth and creating jobs. Investing in sustainable infrastructure can create jobs and support economic growth while also addressing the urgent need to address climate change.
Despite the criticism, the Trump administration moved forward with the proposed rule. However, the rule was challenged in court by several environmental groups, and in 2020, a federal court struck down the rule, ruling that the Trump administration had violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to consider the potential environmental impacts of the rule.
The court’s decision was a significant victory for advocates for sustainable infrastructure and the environment. It reaffirmed the importance of considering the potential impacts of climate change in infrastructure planning and underscored the need for infrastructure investments that are resilient and adaptable to the changing climate.
As the nation faces increasing threats from climate change, it is more important than ever to invest in sustainable infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of a changing climate. The court’s decision to strike down the Trump administration’s proposed rule sends a clear message that climate change cannot be ignored in infrastructure planning and that investments in sustainable infrastructure are essential for a resilient future.
