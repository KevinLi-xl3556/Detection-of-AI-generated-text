And You Thought Brexit Was Tough …
Brexit has been a messy and complicated affair, but there are other political situations around the world that are equally, if not more, challenging. Here are some examples of countries facing their own versions of Brexit-style tough moments.


Catalonia:
The wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia in Spain has long sought to become an independent nation. In 2017, the regional government held a referendum on independence that was declared illegal by the Spanish central government. The referendum triggered a political crisis, with the central government imposing direct rule over Catalonia for several months. The situation remains unresolved, with continued protests and tensions between the two sides.


Scotland:
Scotland has long debated leaving the United Kingdom and become an independent nation. In 2014, a referendum was held on Scottish independence, but the result favored remaining within the UK. However, following the Brexit vote, Scotland has renewed calls for a second independence referendum. The UK government has so far refused to grant such a referendum.


Hong Kong:
Hong Kong has been a long-standing special administrative region of China, enjoying a degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” policy. However, recent attempts by the Chinese government to exert more control over Hong Kong have sparked protests and civil unrest. The situation in Hong Kong is ongoing, with no clear resolution in sight.


Northern Cyprus:
Northern Cyprus is a self-declared state recognized only by Turkey, which supports Turkish Cypriot control of the island. Since the island’s division in 1974, there have been talks about reunification or independence. Still, the situation remains tense, with issues such as claims for land, legal status and sovereignty still to be resolved.


Conclusion:
Brexit may have grabbed the headlines all over the world, but it is far from the only political problem facing nations around the world. The situations in Catalonia, Scotland, Hong Kong, and Northern Cyprus are just a few examples of how the desire for independence and self-determination can lead to complex and divisive issues. With continued political unrest in many regions, it remains to be seen how such situations will evolve in the coming years.
