In the world of poetry, there are few books that can capture the attention of readers and leave a lasting impression. However, Homie, a book of poems by Danez Smith, is one such book. With its raw and emotional content, Homie has been creating waves in the poetry community and producing shocking new vibrations.
Published in 2020, Homie is a collection of poems that explores themes such as love, loss, identity, and friendship. Smith, who identifies as Black, queer, and HIV-positive, brings their personal experiences to the forefront of their writing. The result is a powerful and unapologetic voice that demands to be heard.
One of the most striking aspects of Homie is its use of language. Smith’s poetry is both accessible and experimental, blending traditional forms with modern vernacular. The poems are written in a conversational style, with words and phrases that are often associated with Black culture. This creates a sense of intimacy between the reader and the poet, as if they are sitting down for a conversation with an old friend.
Another notable feature of Homie is its exploration of complex emotions. Smith’s poetry is unafraid to delve into the depths of grief, anger, and despair, while also celebrating moments of joy and love. The poems are deeply personal, yet they also speak to universal experiences. In this way, Homie transcends the boundaries of race, gender, and sexuality, and speaks to the human condition as a whole.
Perhaps the most powerful poem in Homie is “not an elegy for Mike Brown,” which was originally performed at the 2014 National Poetry Slam. The poem is a response to the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. In the poem, Smith addresses Brown directly, telling him that he is not forgotten and that his death will not be in vain. The poem is a call to action, demanding that we recognize the systemic racism that led to Brown’s death and work to dismantle it.
Overall, Homie is a book of poems that demands to be read. Smith’s powerful and unapologetic voice will leave readers with a sense of urgency and a desire to effect change. Homie is a reminder that poetry has the power to move us, to challenge us, and to inspire us. If you are looking for a book that will produce shocking new vibrations, look no further than Homie.
