The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was a proposed constitutional amendment that aimed to ensure that equal rights under the law were not denied or abridged on the account of sex. Though it was first introduced in Congress in 1923 and finally passed in 1972, it failed to secure ratification by the necessary number of states before the ratification deadline expired in 1982. However, the ERA has once again come into the spotlight, with renewed efforts to pass it into law. However, it’s clear that the push for an ERA is misguided and ultimately counterproductive.
Supporters of the ERA argue that the amendment is necessary to close the gender wage gap, provide protections for women against discrimination in the workplace, and ensure that women receive equal treatment under the law. However, these concerns are already addressed by existing laws and regulations, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and the Equal Pay Act. Furthermore, the ERA’s focus on sex as a protected class would actually do more harm than good by undermining critical legal precedents that have been established to support women’s rights.
For example, under the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court has already established that sex discrimination is unconstitutional. The language of the ERA is incredibly broad and could lead to unintended consequences, such as interfering with existing laws that promote affirmative action and benefits for women, which are essential to achieving gender equality. Furthermore, the ERA does not account for different biological sexes and the natural physical differences that exist between them. This could result in legal disputes, particularly in areas such as sports, where physical differences between men and women are particularly important. It could also open the door to transgender individuals using the ERA to claim rights that are not biologically available to them.
Moreover, the ERA ignores the fact that women are not a monolithic group and that different women have different needs and preferences. The ERA would not address the concerns of women who choose to prioritize other aspects of their lives, such as raising children or pursuing other goals outside the workplace. It would also fail to recognize the unique struggles faced by women of color, disabled women, and other marginalized groups.
In conclusion, while the push for the Equal Rights Amendment may seem like a positive step towards gender equality, it is ultimately misguided and misguided. Instead of focusing on an amendment that could cause more harm than good, we should be working to improve existing laws and address the specific concerns of different groups of women. We need to focus on solutions that are more targeted, nuanced and inclusive. This will lead to lasting progress and meaningful change for women and marginalized groups, rather than creating further discord and division in society.
