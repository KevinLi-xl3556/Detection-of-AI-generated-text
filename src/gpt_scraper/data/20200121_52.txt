North Korea Bans Foreign Tourists Over Coronavirus, Tour Operator Says
Amidst the ongoing global Coronavirus pandemic, North Korea has reportedly banned entry of all foreign tourists into the country, according to a tour operator based in Beijing, China.
As the world struggles to contain the novel coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China, earlier this year, North Korea has taken drastic measures to protect its citizens and prevent the spread of the virus within its borders. In addition to banning all foreign tourists, the country has also closed its borders with China and Russia, two of its closest allies.
The move is a blow to the small but growing tourism industry in North Korea, which has experienced an increase in visitors in recent years. While the country has long been known for its closed and tightly controlled society, it has also become a popular destination for curious travelers looking to experience the secretive nation and its unique culture.
Despite the diplomatic tensions and trade embargoes, North Korea has slowly been opening up to foreign visitors, with the number of tourists increasing steadily over the past few years. However, with the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (the official name of the Coronavirus disease), the government has decided to close its doors to all foreign visitors, citing concerns over the virus.
Tour operators who specialize in North Korea tours have reported a significant decline in bookings since the ban was announced. While some operators are now cancelling tours altogether, others are offering refunds or rescheduling tours for a later date.
For tourists who have already booked their trips to North Korea, the sudden ban comes as a disappointment, but many are understanding of the governmentâ€™s decision to prioritize public health and safety. While the virus has yet to be detected in North Korea, the country is taking no chances, and has implemented strict measures to prevent its spread.
The ban on foreign tourists is just one of many measures North Korea has taken to protect itself from the virus. The government has also issued strict guidelines for its citizens, including mandatory quarantines for any individuals exhibiting symptoms of the disease.
While the current situation is understandably frustrating for tourists hoping to visit North Korea, it is also a reminder of the importance of public health and safety in the face of a global crisis. For the time being, North Korea has closed its doors to the outside world, but as the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen when the country will open its doors once again.
