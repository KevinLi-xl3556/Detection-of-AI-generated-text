In the bustling borough of Queens, nestled within the rows of traditional Chinese restaurants, there is a hidden gem that boasts the flavors of Bangkok. Tucked away inside a nondescript Chinese restaurant is a tiny kitchen that serves up authentic Thai cuisine, transporting diners on a flavorful journey through the streets of Bangkok.
Located in the heart of Elmhurst, Queens, Chao Thai Kitchen, is a place where patrons can discover the unique fusion of Chinese and Thai cultures. Upon entering the Chinese restaurant, the unsuspecting patron may pass by several large tanks with live fish and lobsters, which suggest a larger than usual Chinese seafood restaurant. However, venturing past the aquarium and through a small hallway, the atmosphere changes, and the senses are immediately awakened by the enticing aromas of Thai spices in the air.
The décor in Chao Thai Kitchen’s dining area may be simple, but it offers an authentic Thai dining experience with low tables, traditional seating on the floor, and paper placemats with Thai writing. However, the real magic happens in the kitchen, where a small but mighty team of skilled cooks craft dishes that can rival the best places in Bangkok.
The menu at Chao Thai Kitchen offers a wide array of traditional and lesser-known Thai dishes. Start with an order of the classic Tom Yum soup, a complex fusion of sour, spicy, and aromatic ingredients that quickly wakes up the palate. For those seeking some heat, the spicy papaya salad never fails to deliver a fiery punch. The curry dishes, including the green curry and Massaman curry, rank among the best in New York City.
One of the standout dishes at Chao Thai Kitchen is the Pad Thai, cooked with incredibly fresh ingredients, and served on a banana leaf, it’s a key highlight. However, the kitchen’s signature dish, the Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli, has diners raving, with the crispy skin and tender pork correctly blended with the slight bitterness of Chinese broccoli. Vegetarians also have tasty options such as the Vegetarian Pad Thai, Prik King with tofu, and glass noodles.
Despite Chao Thai Kitchen’s modest appearance, the expertly made dishes speak for themselves. The food is served with care, and the staff is friendly and attentive. It’s no surprise that Chao Thai Kitchen has earned a cult following and has been featured in several food guides and local publications over the years.
