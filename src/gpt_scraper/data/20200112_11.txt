In the world of American television, Judge Judy is a household name. Known for her no-nonsense attitude and quick wit, Judge Judy has been a beloved figure on television screens for over two decades. And while the show may be centered around Judge Judy’s ability to settle disputes in the courtroom, she recently made a decision outside of her usual realm of expertise: she likes Michael Bloomberg.
The former mayor of New York City has been in the public eye for decades, but his recent presidential campaign put him in the spotlight like never before. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman and philanthropist, sought the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, but ultimately dropped out of the race after a poor showing on Super Tuesday.
Despite his defeat, Bloomberg has remained in the public eye and continued to be a vocal advocate for various causes. And it seems that his efforts have not gone unnoticed by Judge Judy, who recently voiced her support for the former mayor.
In a recent interview, Judge Judy explained her admiration for Bloomberg, citing his business acumen and dedication to philanthropy as key reasons for her support. “He’s a smart guy, he’s a good businessman, and he’s done a lot of good with his money,” she said. “I like people who put their money where their mouth is.”
But Judge Judy’s endorsement of Bloomberg goes beyond his business and philanthropic endeavors. She also believes that he has the necessary qualities to be a successful leader. “He’s got the leadership skills, he’s got the experience, and he’s got the temperament,” she said. “I think he’d make a great president.”
Of course, Judge Judy’s endorsement is just one opinion among many. And while Bloomberg has enjoyed success in the business world, his political aspirations have been met with both support and criticism. But for Judge Judy, her decision is clear: she likes Michael Bloomberg, and she believes that he would make a great president.
It’s not every day that a celebrity like Judge Judy weighs in on politics, but when she does, people take notice. And while her endorsement may not sway the opinions of millions of voters, it’s a reminder that even the most unexpected voices can have an impact on the political landscape.
