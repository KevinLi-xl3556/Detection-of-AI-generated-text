Former Nissan CEO, Carlos Ghosn, made headlines in December 2019 after he escaped from Japan and fled to Lebanon, where he currently resides. However, new information has recently come to light showcasing that Ghosn had assistance in his escape plan from a former Green Beret, Michael Taylor.
Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, were arrested in May 2020 in Massachusetts, USA, for their role in Ghosn’s escape. They are currently facing extradition to Japan, where they could face up to three years in prison for violating Japan’s immigration control law.
The Taylors had allegedly helped Ghosn escape by transporting him in a large black box usually used for musical instruments, claiming that it contained speakers. The box was then transported to a private jet, which flew Ghosn to Turkey before he ultimately landed in Lebanon.
Michael Taylor’s background as a former Green Beret has raised concerns regarding his involvement in the escape. Green Berets are a unit within the US Army Special Forces, responsible for carrying out unconventional warfare and special operations. The expertise and training that Michael Taylor gained as a part of this elite unit could have played a role in the success of Ghosn’s escape plan.
This recent development has raised questions regarding the security measures in place in Japan’s justice system. Japan is known for its strict regulations and high conviction rates, making it difficult for those who are accused of committing crimes to escape persecution. However, Ghosn’s escape plan shows that even with Japan’s tight security measures, a well-planned escape is possible.
This incident has also highlighted the power dynamic within corporations, as Ghosn was one of the most high-profile and powerful CEOs in the automotive industry. His escape has led to increased scrutiny on the inner workings of Nissan, the company he had presided over, and the company’s relationship with Japanese authorities.
The fate of the Taylors is still uncertain, but this case serves as a reminder that no matter how well-developed a country’s security system may be, there will always be individuals who can navigate the loopholes within it. The escape of Carlos Ghosn not only sheds light on the vulnerabilities within Japan’s justice system but also serves as a cautionary tale for those who believe they are above the law.
