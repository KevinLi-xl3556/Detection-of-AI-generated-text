In an opinion piece published on Christianity Today, the magazine’s editor lamented what he called the “ethical naïveté” of those who continue to support President Donald Trump despite his numerous scandals and controversial actions.
Mark Galli, the editor-in-chief of the popular evangelical Christian publication, wrote that it was a “tragic irony” that many Christians who claim to value moral principles and ethical behavior have chosen to overlook Trump’s faults in order to advance their political goals.
“Christians are supposed to be people of integrity, people who prioritize moral principles over political expediency,” wrote Galli. “Yet many of us have embraced a man who embodies everything that is antithetical to our values.”
Galli acknowledged that Trump’s policies on issues such as abortion and religious freedom may align with the views of many Christians, but argued that this did not excuse his “gross immorality” and disregard for the rule of law.
“The ends do not justify the means,” he wrote. “Christians who support Trump need to recognize that their credibility and witness are on the line. We can’t afford to be seen as hypocrites who are willing to overlook blatant wrongdoing in order to advance our own agenda.”
Galli’s column sparked a fierce debate within the evangelical community, with some conservative Christians accusing him of being too politically partisan and others applauding his courageous stance on principle.
The editorial also came amid growing scrutiny of Trump’s relationship with evangelical voters, who have been a key part of his base of support. Some commentators have suggested that Trump’s actions have caused many evangelical Christians to question their allegiance to the Republican Party and to reconsider their political priorities.
Regardless of the political fallout, however, Galli’s column has drawn attention to the vital role that Christians must play in upholding ethical standards and promoting moral values in the public sphere.
As Galli concluded in his article, “we have a responsibility to stand up for what is right, even when it is difficult or unpopular. We cannot let our political allegiances compromise our commitment to truth, justice, and righteousness.”
