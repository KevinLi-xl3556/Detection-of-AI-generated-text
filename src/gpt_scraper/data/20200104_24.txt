American Foreign Policy Is Broken. Suleimani’s Killing Proves It.
The United States of America, for years, has been synonymous with “superpower.” Its economic, military, and diplomatic influence have played a critical role in shaping the world we live in. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing concern over America’s foreign policy. Critics argue that America’s foreign policy is broken and that the US needs to revisit its priorities and methods.
The killing of the Iranian General, Qassim Suleimani, in January 2020, reignited the debate on American foreign policy. The operation, which was a result of the Iranian general’s alleged involvement in attacks against American soldiers and interests, raised serious questions about the US’s intentions and approach to foreign policy.
One of the major criticisms of American foreign policy is its overreliance on military force. The “war on terror” that began in the aftermath of 9/11 is a prime example of this approach. The US has been heavily involved in the Middle East for the past two decades, with its strong military presence and drone strikes causing casualties and destruction in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.
The Suleimani killing was a manifestation of this approach. By assassinating the Iranian General, the US was sending a message to Iran that it will not tolerate any attacks on its interests or allies. However, instead of diffusing tensions, the operation escalated the situation, with Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes and a near-war situation.
Moreover, the killing of Suleimani raised concerns about the legal and moral basis for such operations. The US has been criticized for its use of drone strikes, which have killed civilians, and for its extrajudicial killings. The Suleimani operation was no different, as it was carried out without congressional approval or consultation with allies.
Another criticism of American foreign policy is its focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability. The US has been accused of supporting dictators and authoritarian regimes, promoting democracy only when it suits its interests, and neglecting issues such as climate change, poverty, and inequality.
The killing of Suleimani was a short-sighted move that ignored the potential long-term consequences. It increased the risk of an all-out war in the Middle East and destabilized the region further. It also alienated America’s European allies, who criticized the move and called for de-escalation.
America’s foreign policy is broken, and the killing of Suleimani showcases that. The US needs to move away from its reliance on military force and focus on diplomacy and dialogue. It needs to prioritize long-term stability over short-term gains and work towards addressing global challenges like climate change, poverty, and inequality.
The US also needs to acknowledge the limits of its power as a superpower. The world is changing, with rising powers like China and Russia challenging America’s dominance. The US needs to adapt to this changing world order, work with allies, and build partnerships based on mutual respect and understanding.
In conclusion, the killing of Suleimani is a wake-up call for the United States of America. It is a reminder that American foreign policy is broken and in need of urgent reform. The US needs to move away from its reliance on military force, prioritize diplomacy, and focus on long-term stability. Only then can it regain its position as a superpower and lead the world towards a better future.
