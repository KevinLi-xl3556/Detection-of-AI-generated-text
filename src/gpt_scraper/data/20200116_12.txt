Title: Barneys Workers Feel Used as They March Store Toward Death
Barneys, the iconic luxury department store that has been a fixture of New York City since 1923, has been struggling to stay afloat in recent years. After filing for bankruptcy in 2019, the company was purchased by Authentic Brands Group, which promised to revive the brand and keep the stores open. However, it appears that the revival was short-lived, as the company has announced that it will be closing all of its physical stores and transitioning to an online-only business model.
This announcement has come as a shock to many of the workers at Barneys, who have been working tirelessly to keep the stores open and maintain the brandâ€™s reputation. They feel used and undervalued by the company, which seems to be more concerned with its bottom line than with the welfare of its employees.
According to several current and former Barneys employees, the company has been cutting corners and making cuts to employee benefits for years, all in the name of profitability. Many workers have had their hours reduced, their healthcare benefits scaled back, and their job security threatened, all while the company continued to make billions of dollars in sales.
Now, as the stores are being shuttered and the workers are being laid off, many feel as though they have been used as pawns in a larger game. They believe that the company never had any intention of keeping the stores open, but instead used them as a last-ditch effort to make a profit before moving entirely online.
The closure of Barneys has also raised concerns about the future of retail in America. As more and more stores move online, workers in the industry are finding themselves out of work and struggling to make ends meet. Many are calling for greater protections and benefits for retail workers, who often work long hours for low wages and few benefits.
The closure of Barneys is a sad moment for many New Yorkers who have grown up with the iconic store as a symbol of luxury and style. But for the workers who have given their time and energy to keep the stores open, it is a bitter reminder of the often thankless work of retail. As the industry continues to shift and change, it is important that we do not forget the workers who make it all possible.
