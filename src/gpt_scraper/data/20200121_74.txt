Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to strongly recommend John Waters’s film ‘Desperate Living’ as an essential addition to any film studies program. As a film enthusiast and educator, I have had the pleasure of viewing countless films, but ‘Desperate Living’ stands out as a unique and influential piece of cinema that should not be overlooked.
Released in 1977, ‘Desperate Living’ is a dark comedy that follows the story of Peggy Gravel, a middle-aged woman who has just killed her husband and seeks refuge in a town called Mortville, populated by outcasts and misfits. The film is a satirical take on suburban life, and explores themes such as gender and sexuality, social class, and societal norms.
What makes ‘Desperate Living’ an outstanding film is not only its content, but also its unique style and direction. Waters’s use of bright colors, exaggerated characters, and unconventional camera angles creates a surreal and captivating atmosphere that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film. The film’s low-budget production only adds to its charm and authenticity, and further showcases Waters’s ingenuity as a filmmaker.
Moreover, ‘Desperate Living’ is a notable example of Waters’s signature style and serves as a significant precursor to his later, more well-known films such as ‘Hairspray’ and ‘Pink Flamingos’. It is a crucial piece in understanding Waters’s cinematic evolution, and thus, an important film for any serious film student to study.
In addition to its cinematic value, ‘Desperate Living’ is also an important cultural artifact of its time, reflecting the societal and political issues that were present in 1970s America. Its representation of marginalized groups and its criticism of societal norms make it an invaluable piece of American counterculture.
Overall, I highly recommend ‘Desperate Living’ as an essential addition to any film studies program. Its unique style, compelling storyline, and cultural significance make it a film that should not be overlooked. It is a testament to John Waters’s talent as a filmmaker and his impact on American cinema.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
