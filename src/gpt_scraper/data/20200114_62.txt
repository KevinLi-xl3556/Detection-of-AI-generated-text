After a long wait, the International Center of Photography (ICP) is finally reopening its doors at the Essex Crossing in New York City. The ICP museum had been closed since January 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it will be welcoming visitors again starting in September 2021.
The ICP is one of the most prestigious institutions dedicated to photography and visual culture worldwide. Founded in 1974, the ICP has been an instrumental force in promoting the value and significance of photography as an art form. Not only does it provide a platform for emerging and established photographers, but it also holds an impressive collection of historic and contemporary photography that has been widely exhibited and celebrated.
The museum’s new location at the Essex Crossing is a significant move in expanding its reach and impact. Essex Crossing is a large-scale development project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan that includes residential properties, retail spaces, and cultural institutions. The ICP’s new home features a spacious 40,000 square feet area equipped with state-of-the-art facilities that allow the museum to provide more in-depth exhibitions, installations, and programs.
According to Mark Lubell, ICP’s Executive Director, the new space represents an exciting new chapter for the institution, allowing it to connect with broader audiences and engage with new communities. Lubell highlights the museum’s mission: “We are committed to inspiring, educating, and engaging with diverse audiences through the power of photography and visual culture. Our new home gives us the opportunity to do this on a larger scale, using advanced technologies and more extensive community involvement.”
To celebrate the reopening, the ICP has announced several exhibitions scheduled to run through the next year. Visitors can expect a diverse range of photographic works across various genres, including fashion, documentary, and fine art. Highlights include “But Still, It Turns: Recent Photography from the World,” featuring works by over 20 international artists exploring ideas of home, identity and displacement, “Curator’s Choice: Black Women,” a celebration of black women photographers from the ICP’s permanent collection, and “Questioning the Image: Rights, Responsibilities, and Repercussions,” which examines the role of photography in shaping social and political discourses in today’s world.
The ICP’s reopening is a significant and exciting moment for photography lovers and culture enthusiasts alike. The museum is poised to continue its transformational work in bridging communities and promoting the importance of visual storytelling. Its new location at the Essex Crossing marks an exciting chapter for the institution, allowing for more significant collaborations and connections with the city’s diverse communities. After a long period of closure, the ICP is finally ready to open its doors once again and welcome visitors to explore the fascinating world of photography.
