Lesson of the Day: ‘How’s Your Internship Going? This Teen Found a Planet’
A 17-year-old high school student, Wolf Cukier, was enjoying his summer internship at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, when he unexpectedly made a groundbreaking discovery: a planet that had never been seen before.
Cukier was going through data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite program, which scans the skies for drops in brightness that could signal a planet passing in front of a star. He came across an interesting anomaly in the data, which turned out to be a planet orbiting two stars.
The planet, now named TOI 1338 b, is the first circumbinary planet, a planet that orbits two stars, ever discovered by the TESS program. This discovery was even more impressive as it was Cukier’s first internship with NASA,
making this extraordinary experience his first entry point into the scientific community.
Cukier’s discovery has attracted and amazed many scientists, including one of the lead TESS researchers, Veselin Kostov, who had previously thought that finding such a planet would need much more work and resources in comparison to this simple yet powerful discovery, that was made by a high school student.  Cukier’s discovery and analysis of the data has assisted in shedding more light on the orbit and manner of a binary-star system, and could greatly contribute to further research into the formation and behavior of the planets.
This discovery has captured the attention of the world, making people wonder what other young and brilliant minds can achieve with access to the right resources and opportunities. Teenagers are in a unique position, as they approach challenges and problems that surround them with fresh eyes and fresh perspectives. It is inspiring to see someone so young contributing to the scientific community in such a significant manner.
Cukier’s achievement serves as a reminder and motivation for people of all ages to keep pursuing their passions and interests regardless of their backgrounds, age or experience. Every contribution, no matter how small it may seem to be, counts and can make an enormous impact.
This story is a testament to the importance of creating pathways for young people that spark their curiosity, encourage their imagination, and enable them to achieve incredible results. It is a reminder that the next breakthrough could come from the most unexpected and youthful of sources.
In conclusion, Wolf Cukier’s achievement reminds us of the power of perseverance, hard work, and determination. Furthermore, his discovery shows that age is just a number, and that everyone has the capacity to make meaningful contributions to society regardless of their backgrounds.
