One of the most important factors to consider when choosing a winter vacation rental location is weather. You want to select a place that is snow-covered yet still accessible. Ski resorts are always a highly demanded location for winter vacation rentals due to their guaranteed snow, beginner-friendly slopes, dining options and other activities for all ages.
In the United States, there are many great places to consider buying a winter vacation rental, including Park City, Colorado, Vermont or Lake Tahoe. Each of these areas is known for its picturesque scenery, winter sports, and ample opportunities for relaxing and fun.
Park City, Utah is one of the best places to consider for a winter vacation rental due to its regular snowfall and variety of ski resorts like Deer Valley, Park City Mountain, and Canyons.

Stowe, for instance, has been consistent in receiving commercial tourists, year in year out. This makes it a great choice for buyers interested in promoting their vacation rentals business.
Apart from considering weather and geography, other factors to consider include infrastructure & real estate value in the area. It’s worth doing some research and getting a clear idea of the real estate market and property values in potential locations.

Areas with strong infrastructure also tend to attract more tourists, which can increase rental potential.
