Iran, Ukrainian Airline Crash, Carlos Ghosn: Your Thursday Briefing
On January 8th, 2020, a Ukrainian passenger plane crashed near Tehran, Iran, killing all 176 people on board. The crash has left the world in shock and has prompted many questions surrounding the events leading up to the tragedy.
While early reports suggested that technical difficulties were to blame, evidence has since emerged suggesting that the plane was shot down by Iranian missiles. Iran initially denied any involvement in the crash but later admitted that it was responsible, sparking outrage from the international community.
The incident has further strained tensions between Iran and the United States, which have been at odds since the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. The U.S. has since imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, which has responded with a series of attacks on U.S. targets in the region.
Meanwhile, in Japan, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn made a dramatic escape from house arrest on December 30th, 2019. Ghosn, who was facing charges of financial misconduct, fled the country in a private jet, reportedly hiding in a box designed for transporting musical instruments.
The incident has sparked a massive manhunt for Ghosn, who has been the subject of international attention for his leadership of Nissan and his subsequent legal troubles. The escape has also highlighted the challenges facing Japan’s justice system, which has been criticized for its reliance on lengthy pretrial detentions and interrogations.
Despite his escape, Ghosn maintains his innocence and has accused Nissan and Japanese officials of conspiring against him. The case has brought renewed attention to the issue of corporate governance in Japan and has raised questions about the country’s legal system.
