Europe’s Gamble: Can It Save Iran Deal by Threatening to Kill It?
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, has been facing grave uncertainties since May 2018, when the US withdrew from the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. The other signatories of the deal, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China, have been struggling to maintain the accord and prevent Iran from abandoning it entirely. With increasing tensions in the region and the threat of a nuclear arms race, European leaders have been exploring various options to save the Iran deal, even if it means threatening to kill it.
The Iran nuclear deal, negotiated under the Obama administration, aimed to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal was considered a historic achievement, as it lowered the chances of a military confrontation between Iran and the US and its allies. However, President Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal has thrown the agreement into turmoil. Despite the US sanctions, Iran initially continued to abide by the deal but recently started to breach some of its commitments, such as increasing its uranium enrichment level.
The European signatories of the deal, known as the E3, have been trying to keep the agreement alive by offering Iran economic incentives in exchange for compliance. However, Iran has argued that the E3’s efforts have fallen short, as the US sanctions continue to impede Iran’s economic recovery. The E3 has been exploring alternative mechanisms to facilitate trade with Iran, such as a special purpose vehicle (SPV), but so far, these initiatives have not been sufficient to offset the impact of US sanctions.
In response to Iran’s recent breaches, the E3 has threatened to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism of the JCPOA, which could lead to the reimposition of UN sanctions on Iran. Although this move could deter Iran from further breaches and potentially preserve the deal, it is also a risky strategy. Iran has warned that any referral to the UN Security Council could lead to the complete collapse of the JCPOA, as well as the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Furthermore, Russia and China, who have closer ties with Iran, may veto any UN resolution against Iran, further complicating the situation.
Another option being considered by some European leaders is to defy the US sanctions and continue trading with Iran, risking retaliation from the US. This would require the establishment of a more robust and independent financial system to bypass the US-dominated global financial system. However, this strategy could further escalate tensions with the US, potentially resulting in a transatlantic rift and further damage to the EU economy.
Thus, the E3’s approach to saving the Iran deal is a gamble, with no clear outcome. However, given the risks of a nuclear arms race and a military confrontation in the region, European leaders believe it is worth exploring all possible options to preserve the JCPOA, even if it means threatening to kill it. The E3 has vowed to remain committed to the deal and work towards finding a diplomatic solution to the impasse. Ultimately, the fate of the Iran nuclear deal rests on the willingness of all parties to negotiate and compromise, rather than escalating tensions and threatening each other.
