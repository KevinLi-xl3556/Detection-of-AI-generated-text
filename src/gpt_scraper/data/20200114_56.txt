The recent documentary film, ‘Citizen K’, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year, has been making waves in the film industry. Directed by Alex Gibney, the film tries to unravel the enigmatic life of a Russian billionaire and oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Khodorkovsky, who was once considered to be one of the wealthiest men in Russia, was arrested in 2003 on charges of fraud and tax evasion. The charges were seen by many as politically motivated, as Khodorkovsky was a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He spent over a decade in prison before being released in 2013 after a pardon from Putin.
‘Citizen K’ delves into the complicated life of Khodorkovsky, who was both a ruthless businessman and a political activist. Through interviews with Khodorkovsky and his associates, the film tries to paint a picture of the man who was once considered to be a key figure in Russian politics.
Gibney’s direction is seamless, and he manages to balance the various perspectives on Khodorkovsky without taking a partisan stance. The film explores Khodorkovsky’s rise to power in the post-Soviet era, his involvement in the oil industry, his charity work, and his political ambitions.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is how it dissects the complicated relationship between Khodorkovsky and Putin. The two were once seen as allies, with Khodorkovsky even funding Putin’s presidential campaign in 2000. However, the two fell out after Khodorkovsky started to challenge Putin’s authority.
The film also touches on the wider political climate in Russia during the 2000s, with the country going through a period of rapid change and instability. The rise of Putin’s government and the influence of wealthy oligarchs like Khodorkovsky had a significant impact on the country’s politics and economy.
Throughout the film, Khodorkovsky remains an enigmatic figure. He is someone who is both admired and despised, depending on who you talk to. However, ‘Citizen K’ manages to capture the complexity of his life and legacy in a way that is both informative and engaging.
Overall, ‘Citizen K’ is a must-see documentary for anyone interested in Russian politics, the country’s complicated history and the role of oligarchs in the country. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of political freedoms and the impact of political power struggles on individuals and society.
