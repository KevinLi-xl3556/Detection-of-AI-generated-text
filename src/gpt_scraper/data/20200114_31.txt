Welcome to your Wednesday briefing! Today we will be covering the latest news and events from around the world, including developments in Iran, the Burisma scandal, and the eruption of the Taal volcano.
Let’s start with Iran. Tensions remain high in the region following the killing of General Qasem Soleimani by the United States. Iran has vowed revenge and launched missile strikes on US bases in Iraq, but it appears that there were no casualties. The situation is still fluid, and it remains to be seen how the US will respond.
Turning to the Burisma scandal, this political scandal has been making headlines since it was revealed that Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, was on the board of directors of the Ukrainian energy company. President Trump has been accused of pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens, leading to his impeachment by the House of Representatives. The Senate trial is now underway, with the President’s defense team making their case.
Finally, let’s talk about the Taal volcano. The Taal volcano, located in the Philippines, erupted on Sunday, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people in the surrounding area. The eruption caused ash clouds to spread over Manila, the capital city, resulting in the closure of schools and airport. The volcano is still active, and authorities are urging people to stay vigilant and take necessary precautions.
That’s all for today’s briefing. Stay tuned for more news and updates as the day develops.
