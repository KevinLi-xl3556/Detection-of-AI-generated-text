Comedian and host of the “Late Show” Stephen Colbert took a humorous yet pointed approach to the recent controversy surrounding the evidence of Ukraine’s involvement in the United States 2016 presidential election.
During a segment of his show, Colbert addressed the revelation that associates of President Donald Trump were pushing for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in exchange for military aid.
As the investigation into this scandal continues to unfold, Colbert drew attention to the lack of discretion in the President’s actions, stating “You don’t write the crime down, you dummy!”
In his characteristic sharp wit, Colbert used sarcasm to critique Trump’s lack of subtlety and proper political etiquette. The fact that Trump was so brazen in his approach to soliciting foreign interference in a United States election is alarming, and puts into question his loyalty and commitment to his duties as President.
Colbert’s commentary highlights the gravity of how improper political behaviour can lead to significant damage to the country. Although satire may seem like an unusual way to present the situation, humour can be used as a powerful tool to bring attention to serious issues.
It is critical that we take all appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of our democracy, and Colbert’s commentary serves as a reminder that we must call out criminal and unethical behaviour, regardless of who perpetrates it.
As the impeachment inquiry continues, it is essential that we remain vigilant and demand transparency and accountability from our elected officials. Colbert’s comedic take on the scandal is a welcome reminder that hope and humour can be found, even in times of great political uncertainty.
