In the long and tumultuous history of civil rights movements, there are few stories more heartbreaking than that of Bayard Rustin. A brilliant strategist, tireless organizer, and key figure in the Civil Rights Movement, Rustin’s legacy has been unfairly overshadowed by his sexuality.
As an openly gay man in the 1950s and '60s, Rustin faced persecution and discrimination even from within the movement he was fighting for. Despite his instrumental role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom—where he was the chief organizer behind Martin Luther King Jr’s “I Have a Dream” speech—Rustin was forced to work quietly behind the scenes, unable to take the public leadership role he deserved.
But now, more than 30 years after his death, Rustin’s legacy may finally be getting the recognition it deserves. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to honor Rustin for his contributions to the civil rights movement and to acknowledge the homophobia that kept him in the shadows for so long.
One major victory came in 2013, when President Barack Obama awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. In his speech, Obama praised Rustin as “an openly gay man at a time when many of his compatriots in the Civil Rights Movement would not have been comfortable with that prospect,” and recognized him as “one of the greatest organizers and strategists on behalf of human rights ever.”
Since then, Rustin has continued to receive posthumous honors and recognition. In 2019, the New York City Council announced plans to rename a street in Brooklyn after Rustin, while California named February 2019 “Bayard Rustin LGBT Freedom Month.”
But perhaps even more importantly, Rustin’s story has become an inspiration and a rallying cry for a new generation of activists fighting for the rights of marginalized people. In 2020, Rustin was featured in an exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture titled “Men of Change: Power. Triumph. Truth.” The exhibit explores Rustin’s life and work alongside other civil rights icons like James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali.
For those fighting for LGBTQ+ rights, Rustin’s life is a powerful reminder of the intersectionality and interconnectedness of different struggles for justice. As one LGBTQ+ activist put it in a recent interview, “Bayard Rustin was a hero not just for black people, but for all people who are fighting for justice and equality. He reminded us that we’re all in this together, and that our struggles are interconnected.”
As we continue to grapple with issues of racism, homophobia, and injustice in our society, it’s more important than ever to remember the legacy of Bayard Rustin. His life is a testament to the power of organizing, the importance of intersectionality, and the possibility of creating real, lasting change.
