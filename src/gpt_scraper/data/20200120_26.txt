Bess Myerson was a beloved figure in American culture, having won the Miss America pageant in 1945 and gone on to become a successful television personality and politician. However, her life was not without its challenges, as her daughter, Barra Grant, reveals in her memoir “Ugly Daughter: A Memoir.” In this review, we’ll take a closer look at this powerful book and what it tells us about the complex relationship between a mother and daughter, and the impact of fame on a family.
“Ugly Daughter” is a deeply personal and often painful exploration of Barra Grant’s relationship with her mother, Bess Myerson. While Myerson was adored by millions of fans across the country, her daughter struggled with feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, feeling constantly overshadowed by her mother’s fame and success. Throughout the book, Grant recounts the many ways in which she felt neglected, rejected, and misunderstood by her mother, and the toll that this took on her own mental health and self-esteem.
At the heart of “Ugly Daughter” is the story of two women struggling to find their place in the world, and the ways in which their paths diverged. While Myerson was celebrated for her beauty, charm, and intelligence, her daughter felt like an outsider, never quite fitting in with the high society circles her mother moved in. As Grant writes, “I didn’t look like my mother, I didn’t talk like my mother, I didn’t dress like my mother…I was the ugly daughter, the one who didn’t quite measure up.”
Despite these challenges, however, Grant’s memoir is ultimately a testament to the enduring bond between mother and daughter, and the power of forgiveness and compassion. Through her honest and vulnerable storytelling, Grant invites us into her world, showing us the highs and lows of her relationship with her mother and the many lessons she learned along the way. She writes with a rare combination of wit, insight, and humility, and her story will resonate with anyone who has ever struggled to find their own voice in the shadow of someone else’s success.
In the end, “Ugly Daughter” is a powerful and poignant memoir that sheds light on the often complicated and messy realities of family life. It is a testament to the enduring power of love, and a reminder that even in the most difficult of circumstances, we can find the strength to heal and grow. If you are a fan of memoirs, or simply looking for a compelling and thought-provoking read, then “Ugly Daughter” is definitely a book worth checking out.
