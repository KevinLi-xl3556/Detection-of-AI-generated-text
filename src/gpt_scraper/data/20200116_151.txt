Marrakesh, a city in Morocco, is well-known for its vibrant arts scene, with traditional artisanal crafts and contemporary artworks showcased in its art galleries and museums. But for those seeking a more immersive experience, a visit to the sculptor’s estate in the outskirts of Marrakesh should not be missed.
Tucked away in the desert landscape, the estate is a wonderland of whimsical artwork. The sculptor, whose name is kept anonymous, has spent years crafting a menagerie of creatures from steel, stone, and wood.

Its fiery breath is sculpted from recycled copper wire and its scales are crafted from sheet metal. The dragon’s massive size and intricate detail are a testament to the sculptor’s skill and imagination.
But the estate is not just about the artwork. The sculptor has created a sanctuary for nature, with lush gardens and a small zoo that houses rescued animals from the surrounding area.
