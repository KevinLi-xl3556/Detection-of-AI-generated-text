The New #TheStew: A Trendy and Delicious One-Pot Dish
One-pot meals are becoming increasingly popular among busy people who want to prepare a delicious and healthy meal without spending too much time in the kitchen. Among the many one-pot dishes that have gained a following in recent years, the newest craze is the #TheStew.
The #TheStew was popularized by the New York Times food columnist Alison Roman in early 2019. Roman’s recipe, which she called “spiced chickpea stew with coconut and turmeric,” quickly went viral, with thousands of people sharing photos of their own versions on social media under the hashtag #TheStew.
What sets #TheStew apart from other one-pot dishes is its unique combination of spices and flavors. The recipe typically includes chickpeas, coconut milk, turmeric, cumin, and paprika, as well as a variety of other vegetables and herbs. The result is a hearty, warming dish that is both satisfying and nutritious.
One of the reasons for the popularity of #TheStew is its versatility. The basic recipe can be adapted to include different types of vegetables or proteins, making it a great option for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. It can also be served over rice, quinoa, or another grain, or eaten on its own as a filling and flavorful meal.
Another reason for the popularity of #TheStew is its simplicity. The dish can be prepared in just one pot, which means less time spent washing dishes and more time spent enjoying the meal. It’s also a great option for meal prep, as it can be made in advance and stored in the fridge or freezer for easy reheating later.
In addition to being delicious and easy to make, #TheStew is also a healthy choice. Chickpeas are a good source of protein and fiber, while coconut milk is rich in healthy fats. Turmeric, cumin, and paprika are all anti-inflammatory spices that can help boost the immune system and improve overall health.
If you’re looking for a new one-pot dish to add to your repertoire, #TheStew is definitely worth a try. With its unique combination of spices and flavors, it’s a dish that is sure to impress your taste buds and satisfy your hunger. So grab a pot, some chickpeas, and your favorite veggies, and get cooking!
