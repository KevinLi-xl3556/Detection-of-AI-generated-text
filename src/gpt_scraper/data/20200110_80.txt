On Saturday, Congress passed a new law that expands the uses for 529 college savings accounts, giving parents and grandparents more flexibility when saving for their children’s education. This change in the law presents an opportunity for individuals to increase their financial planning, as well as provide a better future for their loved ones.
Until now, 529 college savings accounts were only able to be used for qualified higher education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, and supplies. However, the new law now allows families to also use these savings accounts to pay for apprenticeships and student loan repayment, up to $10,000 each.
This is great news for families who want to support their children’s higher education dreams, but also want to be prepared for other options that may come along. Many people don’t realize that an apprenticeship can be just as good, if not better, than traditional college. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, nearly 90% of apprentices are employed after they complete their program, with an average starting salary of around $60,000.
Not only does this new law expand the uses for 529 college savings accounts, it also provides relief for those who are drowning in student loan debt. With student loan debt topping $1.6 trillion in the U.S., many recent graduates struggle to pay back their loans and are unable to contribute to the economy by buying homes or starting their own businesses. By allowing 529 savings to be used for student loan repayment, families can help alleviate some of the burden that comes with paying for higher education.
It’s important to remember that while the new law does expand the uses for 529 college savings accounts, it also has some limitations. For example, the student loan repayment option only applies to the account holder, which means that if a grandparent opened the account for their grandchild, they may not be able to use the funds for this purpose.
Regardless of the limitations, the expansion of 529 college savings accounts is a positive move towards better financial planning and preparing for the future. Saving for higher education can be stressful, but with this new law, families can rest a little easier knowing that they have more options available to them.
