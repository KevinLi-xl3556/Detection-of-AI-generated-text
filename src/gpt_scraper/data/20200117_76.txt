A former landlord, who was convicted for his role in a deadly explosion in the East Village neighborhood of New York City, has been sentenced to a minimum of four years in prison.
Dilber Kukic, 44, was convicted of manslaughter, assault, and reckless endangerment for his role in the March 2015 gas explosion that killed two people and injured many others. The blast was caused by an illegal gas setup at one of Kukic’s buildings.
Kukic, who appeared in court on Tuesday, apologized to the victims and their families, stating that he was “truly sorry for what happened”. However, the judge noted that Kukic had shown a “total disregard for human life” and had put others at risk by ignoring building codes and safety regulations.
The explosion destroyed three buildings and displaced dozens of people. Moises Locon, 27, and Nicholas Figueroa, 23, both died in the blast. Figueroa’s family was present in court and delivered emotional statements during the sentencing, calling for justice for their son’s death.
Kukic’s sentence was met with mixed reactions. Some praised the judge for holding the landlord accountable for the explosion, while others believed that the sentence was too lenient. One victim, who suffered serious injuries in the explosion, stated that “four years is not enough time for the pain and suffering that we have endured”.
The case highlights the importance of building safety regulations and the dangers of illegal gas setups. Landlords who ignore these regulations not only put their tenants at risk but also endanger the lives of those in the surrounding area. The tragedy in the East Village serves as a reminder of the need for proper building inspections and the enforcement of safety codes.
Overall, Kukic’s sentencing should serve as a warning to other landlords and property owners who neglect the safety of their tenants and the community. The justice system has made it clear that those who violate safety regulations will face serious consequences.
