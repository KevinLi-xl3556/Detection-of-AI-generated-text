I Thought This Was an All-Inclusive Resort: A Cautionary Tale For Your Next Vacation
We’ve all heard the horror stories about people who go on vacation and are sorely disappointed by their accommodations. Maybe the hotel wasn’t as advertised or the beaches weren’t as pristine as the brochure made them out to be. But what if you thought you booked an all-inclusive resort but ended up with just the basics? That’s exactly what happened to me on a recent trip I took, and I wanted to share my cautionary tale with you so that you can avoid the same mistake.
It all started when my friend and I decided to book a last-minute trip to Mexico. We were looking for a relaxing getaway where we wouldn’t have to worry about a thing, so we opted for an all-inclusive resort. We found one online that looked perfect - beautiful photos of the property, glowing reviews, and all the amenities we could ask for. We booked it without hesitation.
Unfortunately, our excitement turned to disappointment as soon as we arrived. Yes, the property was beautiful, but it quickly became clear that the “all-inclusive” amenities were not what we had expected. The restaurant we were excited to try only offered a la carte menus, and some dishes came with an extra charge. The drinks we wanted to enjoy by the pool had to be purchased separately. Even the beach chairs weren’t included in the package we had booked!
We felt frustrated and misled, but after some digging, we realized that the resort had different packages with varying levels of inclusions - and we had unknowingly booked the lowest-tier package. It was a harsh lesson to learn, but we came away from the experience with some valuable takeaways:


Do your research. Don’t rely solely on the resort’s website or brochure - make sure you read reviews and double-check what’s included in your package.


Ask questions. Call the resort or your travel agent and ask specific questions about what’s included and what’s extra. Don’t leave anything to chance.


Consider your priorities. Are you willing to pay extra for certain amenities or experiences? If so, make sure you know what to expect in terms of cost.


Have a backup plan. If things don’t turn out as expected, have a backup plan in place. Research nearby restaurants or activities that you can enjoy without breaking the bank.


Overall, our experience taught us that “all-inclusive” doesn’t always mean what we think it means. It’s important to do your due diligence and ask the right questions to ensure you’re getting the experience you want. With a little extra effort, you can avoid disappointment on your next vacation - and have a truly all-inclusive, stress-free getaway.
