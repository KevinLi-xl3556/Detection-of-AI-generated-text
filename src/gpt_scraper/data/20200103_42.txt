A History of War in Six Drugs
Throughout history, wars have been fought over various reasons, including territory, resources, power, and religious beliefs. But it’s not just ideology that fuels conflicts; drugs have played a significant role in several wars. Here’s a detailed account of how six drugs have affected the course of wars across different eras and regions.


Opium
Opium is one of the oldest drugs used in warfare. During the Opium Wars between 1839 and 1860, Britain and China battled over trade regulations, and opium was one of the key items. Britain smuggled opium into China, leading to widespread addiction and social problems. The conflict resulted in two wars, with the British army emerging victorious and gaining control of Hong Kong.


Cocaine
Cocaine played a role in World War II, with both Allied and Axis powers using the drug to improve soldiers’ performance. For the Germans, cocaine was an essential ingredient in designing their fighter planes, as it was believed to improve pilots’ focus and concentration. The Japanese also distributed the drug to their troops, hoping to increase their fighting abilities.


Heroin
Heroin became a weapon of choice for the United States during the Vietnam War. The CIA played a significant role in trafficking heroin into the country, using the money generated to fund their operations. The widespread addiction among American soldiers also helped keep them docile and less resistant to orders.


Methamphetamine
Methamphetamine, commonly known as crystal meth, has been implicated in several conflicts, but its use is most notable in the war in Afghanistan. The Taliban relies on drug trafficking to fund their insurgency, with meth being the primary drug produced in the country. The drug is used both by the Taliban fighters themselves and as a commodity for trade.


Krokodil
Krokodil is a synthetic drug invented in Russia and widespread in Eastern Europe. Its production does not require complex technology or expensive ingredients, making it a popular drug among war-torn populations. However, homemade drug production leads to terrible health consequences. In regions such as Ukraine and Russia, where drug use is rampant, Krokodil has contributed to a decline in life expectancy and an increase in mortality rates, among other health problems.


Cannabis
Cannabis has played a significant role in modern conflicts, especially in those involving militaries in the Middle East. The US army in Iraq and Afghanistan has been documented as using marijuana as a way of coping with the stress of combat. The drug’s calming and pain-reducing effects made it an attractive alternative to traditional treatments.


In conclusion, drugs have played a significant role in the cause and conduct of many wars, both ancient and modern. From the early days of opium trade to the current conflict in Afghanistan, drugs continue to shape our world and have far-reaching impacts on global peace and stability. While some may argue that drugs have been used to gain a competitive advantage in warfare, their effects are often devastating to both soldiers and civilians.
