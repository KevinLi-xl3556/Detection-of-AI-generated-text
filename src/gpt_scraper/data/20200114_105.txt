How Does President Sanders Sound to You?
As the United States approaches its next presidential election in 2020, voters face a crowded field of candidates from both major parties and many independents. Among the Democratic contenders, one name stands out for his progressive agenda, grassroots support, and populist rhetoric: Bernie Sanders, the Senator from Vermont who ran a surprisingly strong campaign in 2016 and has since become a leading advocate of progressive policies such as Medicare for All, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage.
Sanders, who is 78 years old, announced his candidacy on February 19, 2019, and quickly raised over $5.9 million in the first 24 hours, more than any other Democratic candidate had in their first day of fundraising. Sanders also enjoys high name recognition, especially among younger voters who appreciate his authenticity, consistency, and boldness. However, Sanders also faces challenges from some Democrats who claim that his socialist label, his age, or his gender could weaken his appeal to the broader electorate, especially in swing states that Democrats need to win to defeat President Trump.
So, how does President Sanders sound to you? That might depend on your political ideology, your personal values, and your assessment of his strengths and weaknesses. Some people might see Sanders as a visionary leader who can inspire millions of Americans to demand justice, equality, and sustainability in their society. They might agree with his critique of income inequality, political corruption, and corporate power, and support his policies of expanding access to healthcare, education, and affordable housing. They might also appreciate his record of fighting for civil rights, workersâ€™ rights, and environmental protection in Congress, and his ability to mobilize millions of people through online platforms and grassroots organizations such as Our Revolution and the Democratic Socialists of America.
Other people might see Sanders as a divisive figure who could fracture the Democratic Party and alienate moderate or independent voters. They might worry that his proposals, such as a Green New Deal that aims to transform the economy and society within a decade, are too ambitious or unrealistic, and could create economic dislocation or political backlash. They might also doubt his ability to navigate the complex foreign policy challenges facing the US, such as the Syrian conflict, the tensions with North Korea, or the Russian meddling in US democracy, and they might see his isolationist tendencies as a liability for national security. They might also question his electability, given his past loss to Hillary Clinton in the primary and his low favorability ratings among some demographics.
Yet, regardless of what one thinks about Sanders, his campaign already has an impact on the national conversation and the Democratic platform. His call for a political revolution that puts people over profits, his rejection of big money and corporate influence in politics, and his insistence on systemic change rather than incremental reforms have shifted the debate among Democrats and influenced other candidates such as Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker to adopt some of his ideas. Moreover, Sanders has galvanized a new generation of activists who see him as a role model and a symbol of hope for a better future.
Therefore, the question of how President Sanders sounds to you might be less important than the question of how his campaign can help shape the political agenda and mobilize the grassroots for social change. Whether Sanders wins or loses the nomination or the election, his impact on American politics cannot be denied, and his legacy will continue to inspire and challenge future generations of leaders and citizens to strive for a more just and equitable society.
