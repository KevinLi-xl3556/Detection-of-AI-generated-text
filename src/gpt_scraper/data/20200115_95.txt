The 2020 United States Presidential Election is mostly remembered for the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter Movement, and the numerous debates that pitted Republican incumbent Donald Trump against Democratic nominee Joe Biden. These debates were highly anticipated, as they were seen as the platform for the candidates to articulate their visions and to give voters a chance to evaluate their platforms side by side.
The ‘On Politics’ team, composed of journalists and political pundits from various media outlets, was tasked to provide in-depth coverage of the debates. Their insights allowed the electorate to have a deeper understanding of the political discourse and to analyze the candidates’ policies.
The first presidential debate, held on September 29th, 2020, in Cleveland, Ohio, lead to a chaotic evening filled with interruptions and name-calling. Both candidates failed to address crucial issues and instead focused on personal attacks. On Politics commentators concluded that Biden emerged the clear victor as he was able to express his message and platform more competently.
The Vice Presidential debate between Mike Pence, the incumbent Vice President, and Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, was held on October 7th, 2020. It was a more civil event, albeit underpinned by far-reaching policy differences. Nevertheless, Harris was the clear winner according to the On Politics team, mainly due to her calmness and articulated responses.
The second Presidential debate, which was scheduled for October 15th, 2020, became a victim of the Coronavirus pandemic. Trump, who contracted COVID-19, refused to participate in a virtual event, leading to its cancellation.
The final Presidential debate took place on October 22nd, 2020. The discussions were marked by a rather significant shift, with the tone and substance more measured and focused compared to the first debate. Trump was seen as more composed and punctual, while Biden maintained his steadiness and clarity of message. The On Politics team analyzed the debate and concluded that Biden won due to his ability to articulate his policies and attack Trump on his controversial policies.
The debates played an essential role in shaping the election’s outcome. They helped voters to understand the candidates’ values and the direction of the respective parties. The ‘On Politics’ team was instrumental in bringing an in-depth analysis of the debates, highlighting both the potential and the failures of the candidates. In the end, the debates were only one part of the electoral process, but they added an essential dimension to the public’s understanding of American politics.
