Impeachment, Russia, Puerto Rico: Your Thursday Briefing
As the week comes closer to an end, news from around the world continues to make front-page headlines. From impeachment proceedings to international politics, here are some of the latest updates on the world stage to keep you informed.
Impeachment Hearings Begin
The US House Intelligence Committee began public impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump on Wednesday. William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, testified on the first day. Both officials testified that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to pressure the country to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. The hearings are set to continue on Friday, with Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, scheduled to appear.
Russia Returns Ukrainian Naval Ships
Ukraine and Russia made headlines on Monday as Russia returned three naval ships it had seized from Ukraine during a naval confrontation last year. The return of the ships comes ahead of peace talks between the two countries that are scheduled for next month. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine and has long sought the return of the ships as a sign of goodwill.
Puerto Rico in Political Turmoil
Protests continue in Puerto Rico as residents call for the resignation of Governor Ricardo Rosselló. The protests, which have been ongoing since July, were sparked by a leaked chat that showed Rosselló and several top aides exchanging messages that were misogynistic and homophobic. Rosselló initially resisted calls to resign, but on Tuesday, he announced that he would step down on August 2. In the meantime, the political turmoil continues.
