In the race for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker have been raising impressive amounts of money, but they still trail far behind the frontrunners in the race. Both candidates have been working hard to build support and raise funds, but they have a long way to go if they hope to catch up to the likes of Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders.
As of the latest fundraising reports, Klobuchar has raised $12 million, while Booker has raised $6 million. These are both impressive numbers, but they pale in comparison to the amount of money raised by the leaders of the pack. Joe Biden has raised over $40 million, Elizabeth Warren has raised $35 million, and Bernie Sanders has raised $25 million.
So why are Klobuchar and Booker lagging so far behind? There are a number of factors at play. For one thing, they are relatively unknown compared to the frontrunners, which makes it harder for them to attract big donors. Additionally, they have not been in the race for as long as some of their competitors, which has limited their ability to build up momentum and attract support.
But despite these challenges, Klobuchar and Booker remain optimistic about their chances. They have both been crisscrossing the country, meeting with voters and laying out their visions for the future of the country. They have also been using social media and other digital tools to reach out to voters and build up their support base.
One thing that may give Klobuchar and Booker a boost is their ability to appeal to a broad range of voters. Klobuchar has been positioning herself as a pragmatic, centrist candidate who can appeal to voters in the middle of the political spectrum. Booker, on the other hand, has been emphasizing his experience as a mayor and his commitment to social justice issues.
In the end, the 2020 Democratic nomination race is still wide open, and there is plenty of time for candidates like Klobuchar and Booker to gain ground. But if they hope to catch up to the frontrunners, they will need to continue working hard, building support, and raising money. It will be a tough road, but with perseverance and determination, they may yet have a chance to emerge as serious contenders in the race for the White House.
