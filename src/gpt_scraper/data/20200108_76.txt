Iran, Boeing 737, Carlos Ghosn: Your Wednesday Briefing
As the world continues to turn, there are three major stories dominating the headlines today: Iran’s recent missile attack, the Boeing 737 crisis, and former Nissan CEO, Carlos Ghosn’s escape from Japan to Lebanon. Here’s what you need to know:
Iran’s Missile Attack
On Tuesday evening, Iran launched a missile strike on two Iraqi military bases that house US troops. The attack was in response to the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Luckily, no US or Iraqi casualties were reported, and President Trump responded by stating that Iran “appears to be standing down.”
Boeing 737 Crisis
Boeing has been in the hot seat for months over their 737 MAX plane, which was involved in two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. Yesterday, a new bombshell was dropped when internal Boeing documents were released that showed employees mocking regulators and the FAA, as well as expressing concerns about the safety of the plane. Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was also fired from his position last month, and the company is still working to get the 737 MAX approved for flight again.
The Carlos Ghosn Escape
In November 2018, Carlos Ghosn, former CEO of Nissan, was arrested in Japan on charges of financial misconduct. After being released on bail, Ghosn fled the country and ended up in Lebanon. His escape has captivated the world and raised serious questions about Japan’s legal system. Ghosn held a press conference in Lebanon yesterday and called the charges against him “baseless.”
As we move forward into 2020, it’s clear that these three stories will continue to unfold and have a significant impact on the global community. Stay informed and stay safe.
