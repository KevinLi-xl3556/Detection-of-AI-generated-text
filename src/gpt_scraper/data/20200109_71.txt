In a shocking turn of events, the leadership of the Romance Writers of America (RWA) has resigned. This comes after months of controversy and upheaval within the organization, which has been struggling with accusations of racism and lack of diversity.
The RWA is one of the largest and most influential organizations for romance writers in the world, with over 9,000 members. It has been around for almost 40 years and is dedicated to promoting and supporting romance writing and writers.
However, in late 2019, the organization was rocked by a scandal involving allegations of racism against one of its members, Courtney Milan. Milan, a Chinese-American author and former RWA board member, had criticized a book by a fellow member for its racially insensitive content.
In response, the RWA took action against Milan, which led to accusations of racism and discrimination against the organization. Many members resigned in protest, and the RWA was forced to cancel its annual conference.
Since then, the organization has been struggling to regain its footing. Its leadership has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and there have been calls for more diversity and inclusion within the organization.
Now, the entire RWA board has resigned, including President Damon Suede and Executive Director Carol Ritter. In a statement, the board said that they were resigning “in the best interest of the organization and its members.”
The statement also acknowledged that the RWA had “failed to uphold its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion” and that “significant work” needed to be done to address these issues.
The RWA’s future is now uncertain, as the organization will need to find new leadership and rebuild its reputation. Many members are calling for a complete overhaul of the organization, with a focus on diversity and inclusion.
Some are also calling for a new organization to be formed, one that is specifically dedicated to promoting and supporting romance writers from diverse backgrounds.
Whatever happens, it is clear that the romance writing community is at a crossroads. The RWA has played a crucial role in the development and success of romance writing over the past four decades, but it is now facing significant challenges.
The resignation of its leadership is just the latest chapter in a long and difficult story, one that will likely continue to unfold for some time to come.
