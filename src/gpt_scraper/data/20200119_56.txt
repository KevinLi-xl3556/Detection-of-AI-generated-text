In Syria, the civil war has brought a lot of hardships, and women have suffered immensely. A lot of Syrian women, especially in more conservative communities, have been confined to their homes and were only allowed to go out in the company of men, be it their fathers, brothers, or husbands. But when the men disappeared due to the war, these women were left with limited options making their lives incredibly difficult.
As the war continued, men started disappearing at an alarming rate, either because they had joined the opposition, defected to the government side, or tried to escape the conflict. This had a profound effect on women’s lives. All of a sudden, they had to take on roles that traditionally belonged to men, such as being the breadwinners, protecting their families, and making decisions on their own.
Many of these women were ill-equipped for this sudden change and faced significant challenges. They struggled to find ways to make ends meet, facing financial difficulties and unable to provide for their families adequately. Some of them even had to resort to begging on the streets to survive.
With the loss of their male family members, the women were also vulnerable to violence, including crimes such as sexual assault, theft, and kidnapping. They faced harassment and abuse and were sometimes even targeted by extremist groups who sought to exploit their vulnerability.
However, despite these challenges, some women refused to give up. They managed to find ways to adapt to their new circumstances and even flourish under difficult conditions. They became businesswomen, starting small businesses to provide for their families.
One such woman is Amal. She lost her husband and two sons in the war and was left to provide for her seven children on her own. With no education or experience, she started a small food business selling locally made sweets. It was difficult, but with hard work and determination, she managed to succeed, providing for her family and even expanding into new markets.
Other women, like Rania, found solace in activism. With the war drawing attention to the plight of Syrian women, they banded together to advocate for their rights and fight against patriarchal restrictions. They organized meetings, workshops, and events to raise awareness of issues like domestic violence, child marriage, and female genital mutilation.
In conclusion, the disappearance of men due to the war in Syria had grave consequences for women. However, it also created new opportunities for them, forcing them to adapt and innovate to survive. While the war is still ongoing, it’s essential to remember the strength and resilience of Syrian women and the unique challenges they continue to overcome.
