First up, let’s talk about breakfast. For a filling, savory breakfast option, try making a breakfast casserole. This recipe is easy to customize based on your preferences, but here’s a basic one to get you started:
Ingredients:

6 slices of bread, cubed
8 eggs
1 cup of milk
1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: breakfast sausage, diced bell pepper, diced onion, chopped spinach

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.
Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish and spread the cubed bread evenly in the bottom.
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until well combined.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread in the baking dish.
Sprinkle the cheese over the top, then add any additional toppings you like.
Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

For lunch or dinner, why not try making shrimp skewers? This recipe is quick and easy, but packs a ton of flavor.
Ingredients:

1 pound of raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 tablespoon of olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

Preheat your grill or oven to 400 degrees F.
Thread the shrimp (and any additional veggies you like) onto skewers.
In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
Brush the mixture all over the shrimp skewers.
Grill or bake the skewers for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the shrimp are pink and opaque.

Finally, for something sweet, try making homemade ice cream sandwiches. These are a great way to cool down on a hot afternoon, and you can customize them with any flavors you like.
Ingredients:

Your favorite ice cream flavor
1 package of cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal, and ginger snaps all work well)

Instructions:

Soften the ice cream by leaving it out at room temperature for 5-10 minutes.
Using an ice cream scoop or spoon, place a small scoop of ice cream onto the bottom of a cookie.
Top with another cookie and gently press down to make a sandwich.
Repeat with remaining cookies and ice cream.
Optional: Roll the edges of the ice cream sandwiches in crushed nuts, sprinkles, or chocolate chips.
Freeze for at least 30 minutes before serving.
