Senator Marco Rubio has been a vocal critic of U.S. investment in China, and he continues to argue that doing business with the world’s second-largest economy is simply not a good deal.
According to Rubio, the Communist Party of China has engaged in a long pattern of bad behavior that has undermined American interests and values. From human rights abuses to intellectual property theft, Rubio points to a laundry list of grievances that he believes should dissuade U.S. companies from investing in China.
In recent years, as China’s economic power has continued to grow, Rubio has become increasingly worried about the threat the country poses to U.S. national security. He recently introduced a bill that would restrict federal pension funds from investing in Chinese firms listed on U.S. exchanges.
Rubio’s concerns are not without merit. China’s authoritarian government has a history of using economic leverage to exert political influence, both at home and abroad. This has included everything from pressuring foreign companies to censor their content to using economic sanctions to punish countries that refuse to toe the party line.
But while Rubio’s critiques of China are valid, some experts argue that his proposed solutions are too simplistic. For example, restricting investment in Chinese companies could hurt U.S. pension funds and could also drive up the cost of borrowing for U.S. companies.
Moreover, some argue that the U.S. should be engaging with China rather than pushing it away. China is a global economic giant, and isolationism could ultimately weaken the U.S.'s position in the global economy.
Ultimately, the question of whether business with China is a good deal is a complex one with no easy answer. While it is clear that the U.S. must be wary of China’s economic, political, and military power, there are also potential benefits to engaging with the country.
As the U.S. continues to navigate its relationship with China, it is essential that lawmakers like Rubio take a nuanced and balanced approach to these complex issues. Rather than rushing to impose stiff restrictions on Chinese investment, the U.S. must carefully consider the implications of its actions and work to build a relationship that is mutually beneficial for both countries.
