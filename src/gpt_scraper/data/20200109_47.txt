Prince Harry and Meghan Stepping Back, Explained
The royal world shook on January 8, 2020, when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their decision to step back as senior members of the British Royal Family. This announcement caused a stir among the media and royal watchers around the world, leaving everyone questioning the reasons behind it.
So why did they make this decision? In a statement released on their social media platforms, the couple cited their desire to become financially independent and pursue their philanthropic work as the leading reasons for their departure from royal duties. The couple also stated that they will be splitting their time between the UK and North America, primarily Canada, to raise their son Archie in a more private setting.
The couple’s decision to step back from their royal duties has been dubbed “Megxit” by the media, and the royal family faced a wave of criticism as a result of the announcement. Questions have been raised about how this decision will affect the royal family and the monarchy as a whole.
Harry and Meghan’s decision to become financially independent by becoming self-employed has evoked criticism, as some believe that it is not possible for a member of the royal family to do so. Others believe that the couple’s decision is an indication of the changing tide in royal traditions, where members of the royal family are expected to take on their duties with little to no autonomy.
In response to the criticism, the Queen released a statement of her own stating that she understood the couple’s decision and that the Royal Family was working through a “complex series of issues” in order to support their move. The statement also expressed the Queen’s desire for the matter to be resolved quickly, acknowledging the sensitivity of the topic.
The couple’s withdrawal from their senior positions raises new questions about the future of the monarchy. Harry and Meghan represented a new generation of royals, known for their charitable work and forward-thinking attitudes. By stepping back from their positions, they have drawn attention to the need for the Royal Family to adapt to changing times and focus on a more modern approach to their roles.
In conclusion, the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to step back from their royal duties was a shock to many but has brought to light the need for the Royal Family to be more flexible and adaptive. As the royal family works through the “complex issues” surrounding the move, the world watches on with interest, eager to see how the monarchy will evolve in the coming years.
