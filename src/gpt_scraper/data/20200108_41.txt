Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to provide specifics regarding the terms that will apply to any Senate impeachment trial. His refusal to do so has shrouded in uncertainty the fate of the impeachment process against President Trump.
Pelosi had suggested on Tuesday that the House of Representatives would hold the articles of impeachment until she was given guarantees that the Senate trial would be fair, with witnesses who could testify to President Trump’s conduct towards Ukraine.
McConnell rejected Pelosi’s proposal on Wednesday, bluntly stating that the Senate will follow its own rules and “our structure will be based on what we did for the Clinton impeachment trial”. He added that Pelosi needed to “end the political gamesmanship”, and held firm to his position that he would not negotiate the terms of the Senate impeachment trial with the House.
During Wednesday’s floor speech, McConnell declared that the Senate was well aware of the expectations and responsibilities that would come with holding an impeachment trial. He stated that any trial would be conducted with “the same rules of fair play” that have been applied throughout the course of American history.
McConnell’s decision not to negotiate made it clear that it is unlikely that Pelosi’s plan of delaying a Senate impeachment trial would work. Senator Lindsey Graham went so far as to suggest that Pelosi was considering an unconstitutional act, as the articles of impeachment belong to the Senate once approved.
Despite warnings from some Democratic leaders, however, it is likely that the impeachment articles against President Trump will eventually be transmitted to the Senate. At that point, the Senate would be required by the Constitution to hold a trial, one which is expected to exonerate the President because of the slim Republican majority in the Senate.
The Senate Majority Leader McConnell went on to accuse Democrats of unseemly conduct, stating that they “held the country hostage” with their “shoddy work product.” He criticized them for their rushed process, and for pushing an impeachment vote without allowing important witnesses to testify.
The impeachment articles against President Trump claim that he abused his power when he allegedly sought Ukraine’s help in investigating the son of his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The second article alleges obstruction of Congress, as the President refused to cooperate with the investigation.
As of now, Pelosi and McConnell are in a standoff over the terms of the Senate impeachment trial. The House is scheduled to vote on the articles of impeachment next week, which will then be transmitted to the Senate. The Senate is expected to hold a trial in January, despite the growing tensions between the two leaders.
