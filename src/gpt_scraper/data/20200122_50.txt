The U.S. Department of Transportation has proposed a new rule that would restrict the types of animals allowed to fly on planes. If the rule goes into effect, all animals except for dogs would be banned from flying as service animals.
The proposed rule is intended to address concerns from airlines and passengers about the increasing number of animals on flights. In recent years, passengers have been bringing a wide variety of animals on board, from emotional support peacocks to miniature horses. This has led to several in-flight incidents, including animal attacks and disruptions.
Under the proposed rule, only dogs that are specifically trained to assist people with disabilities would be allowed to fly as service animals. This would include guide dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired, as well as psychiatric service dogs for people with mental health conditions.
Any other animals, including cats, miniature horses, and birds, would be classified as pets and would not be allowed to fly in the cabin. Passengers would still be allowed to bring pets on board, but they would need to be kept in a carrier under the seat in front of them.
The proposed rule has sparked a heated debate among animal advocates and disability rights groups. Some argue that it unfairly targets people with disabilities who rely on non-dog service animals, such as miniature horses for mobility assistance. Others argue that the proliferation of untrained animals on flights has created safety risks that need to be addressed.
The Department of Transportation has opened the proposed rule up for public comment, with a deadline of April 6, 2020. It remains to be seen whether the controversial rule will be implemented, and what impact it will have on the millions of Americans who rely on service animals for their daily lives. However, itâ€™s clear that the issue of animals on planes is not going away anytime soon, and airlines and regulators will need to continue to grapple with this complex and emotionally charged issue.
