Richard Gere and Peter Dinklage are set to star in the new film ‘Three Christs’. The two actors were spotted on set recently wearing warm winter coats in preparation for filming in the cold weather. Gere was seen wearing a thick navy blue coat and a grey scarf, while Dinklage wore a dark green parka with a fur-lined hood. These two actors have been in the film industry for many years and have made a name for themselves through their exceptional acting skills.
‘Three Christs’ is said to be based on a true story and follows Dr. Alan Stone (played by Richard Gere) as he attempts to treat three patients who all believe they are Jesus Christ. The story is set in the early 1960s and explores the themes of mental illness and the blurred line between reality and delusion.
Peter Dinklage’s character, Leon, is one of the patients under Dr. Stone’s care. Leon is a small and intense man who is convinced that he is the messiah. Dinklage’s portrayal of the character is said to be hauntingly accurate and intense.
The film is directed by Jon Avnet, who has previously directed popular movies such as ‘Fried Green Tomatoes’ and ‘Up Close & Personal’. The script was written by Eric Nazarian and Jon Avnet, based on the book ‘The Three Christs of Ypsilanti’ by Milton Rokeach.
‘Three Christs’ has a solid supporting cast, including Walton Goggins, Bradley Whitford, and Julianna Margulies. The film is produced by Molly Hassell and Richard Rothstein, with Richard Gere serving as executive producer.
The film is set to be released in 2019 and is already generating buzz in the film industry. With its impressive cast and talented crew, ‘Three Christs’ is sure to be a thought-provoking and engaging film that will stick with audiences long after the credits roll.
