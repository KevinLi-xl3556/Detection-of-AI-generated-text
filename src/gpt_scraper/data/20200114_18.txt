The Dance Theater of Harlem, a renowned ballet company that has been promoting diversity and inclusivity in dance for over 50 years, has just received its biggest gift to date.
On Monday, the company announced that it had been awarded a $25 million gift from philanthropist and arts patron MacKenzie Scott. The donation is part of Scott’s ongoing efforts to support organizations that are working to promote equity and justice in the United States.
“We are deeply grateful to MacKenzie Scott for this incredible gift,” said Anna Glass, the executive director of the Dance Theater of Harlem. “This donation will allow us to continue our mission of using ballet to break down barriers and bring people together.”
Founded in 1969 by Arthur Mitchell, the Dance Theater of Harlem was created as a response to the lack of opportunities for black dancers in traditional ballet companies. Mitchell, a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, saw the need for a company that would give black dancers the chance to showcase their talents and be recognized for their artistry.
Over the years, the Dance Theater of Harlem has become known for its groundbreaking performances and its commitment to diversity and inclusion. The company has toured extensively, both in the United States and abroad, and has performed for audiences of all ages and backgrounds.
With this latest gift from MacKenzie Scott, the Dance Theater of Harlem will be able to expand its reach and impact even further. The company plans to use the funds to support its education and outreach programs, as well as to invest in new works and initiatives that will help to diversify the field of ballet.
“We believe that ballet should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience,” said Glass. “With this gift, we can continue to break down barriers and bring the joy of dance to communities that might not otherwise have access to it.”
Scott’s gift comes at a time when many arts organizations are struggling to survive in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dance Theater of Harlem, like many other companies, was forced to cancel its live performances and in-person classes last year. Despite these challenges, the company has continued to innovate and find new ways to connect with audiences.
“We are confident that the Dance Theater of Harlem will continue to be a beacon of hope and inspiration for dancers and audiences alike,” said Glass. “Thanks to this incredible gift from MacKenzie Scott, we can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in ballet and beyond.”
