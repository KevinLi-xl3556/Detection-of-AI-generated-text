On January 13, 2020, the United States officially removed China from its list of currency manipulators. This decision was announced by the U.S. Treasury Department in its semi-annual report on international economic and exchange rate policies.
The decision marks a significant shift in the U.S.-China economic relationship, which has been strained by trade tensions and accusations of unfair practices. China had been designated as a currency manipulator in August 2019, after its central bank allowed the yuan to weaken against the dollar in response to U.S. tariffs.
However, the U.S. Treasury Department now says that China has made “enforceable commitments” to refrain from devaluing its currency for competitive purposes and to increase transparency around its exchange rate practices.
“China has made significant progress since August 2019 in rectifying the exchange rate practices that led to the August 2019 designation,” the report said. “China has committed to refrain from competitive devaluation, to not target China’s exchange rate for competitive purposes, and to increase transparency and disclosure.”
The U.S. government’s decision to remove China from the list of currency manipulators has been welcomed by many economists and business leaders, who see it as a positive step towards resolving the trade tensions between the two countries.
“Removing China from the list of currency manipulators is a positive development that will help to defuse tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It’s important that the U.S. and China continue to work together to address the remaining economic issues that are impacting bilateral trade and investment flows.”
However, some critics have raised concerns about the timing of the decision, which comes just days before the U.S. and China are expected to sign a “Phase One” trade deal that aims to address some of the key issues in their economic relationship.
“Removing China from the list of currency manipulators just before the signing of the Phase One trade deal raises questions about the sincerity of the U.S. government’s commitment to holding China accountable for its trade practices,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Regardless of these criticisms, the decision to remove China from the list of currency manipulators is a significant development in the U.S.-China economic relationship. It suggests that the two countries are making progress in addressing their differences and finding ways to work together to promote economic growth and stability.
