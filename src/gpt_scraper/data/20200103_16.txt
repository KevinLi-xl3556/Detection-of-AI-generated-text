The Dallas Cowboys have parted ways with their head coach Jason Garrett after a week of uncertainty surrounding his future with the team. This move comes as no surprise to many fans and analysts who have criticized Garrett’s performance and leadership over the past few years.
Garrett had been with the Cowboys organization for a total of 10 years, first as an offensive coordinator and then as head coach for the past nine seasons. During his tenure, the Cowboys had a record of 85-67, with three playoff appearances and just two postseason wins.
Despite having a talented roster on paper, the Cowboys underperformed this season with a disappointing 8-8 record and missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. The team’s lackluster performance led to speculation about Garrett’s job security throughout the season.
The uncertainty surrounding Garrett’s future came to a head on Sunday, the day after the Cowboys’ final game of the season, when team owner Jerry Jones declined to give a definitive answer on whether Garrett would return as head coach for the 2020 season. Instead, Jones said that he would take his time to evaluate the situation and make a decision in the coming days.
Many fans and analysts saw this as a sign that Garrett’s time with the Cowboys was coming to an end. And they were proven right when news broke on Thursday that Garrett had been fired by the team.
In a statement released by the Cowboys, Jones said, “We are extremely grateful to Jason Garrett for his more than 20 years of service to the Dallas Cowboys as a player, assistant coach, and head coach. His dedication and commitment to excellence have been an inspiration to us all.”
Jones also thanked Garrett for his contributions to the team’s success over the years, but added, “This was not an easy decision. It is in the best interest of the Dallas Cowboys to move forward with a new head coach.”
The search for a new head coach has already begun, with a number of candidates being considered for the job. Among them are former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike McCarthy, former Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis, and former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer.
Whoever takes over as head coach of the Cowboys will have big shoes to fill, but fans are hoping that a new leader can bring the team back to its winning ways. The Cowboys have one of the most talented rosters in the NFL, and with the right leadership, they could be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.
