In the world of men’s fashion, the city of Paris has long been known as one of the foremost trendsetters. From haute couture to ready-to-wear, this metropolitan hub of style is a hotbed of creativity and boundary-pushing design. However, in recent years, a new trend has emerged that is shaking up the fashion world: weirdness, emotion, and provocation.
Weirdness in men’s fashion may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the truth is that these designers are embracing the unconventional and unexpected in everything from materials to silhouettes. Designers such as Rick Owens and Yohji Yamamoto have long been celebrated for their avant-garde approaches to clothing, and now a new generation of designers is joining their ranks. Brands like Comme des Garcons and Vetements are pushing the boundaries of traditional tailoring with shapes that are exaggerated, asymmetric, and often downright surreal.
But it’s not just about looking strange. Emotion is a huge part of this movement, with many designers attempting to tap into the feelings and experiences of the modern man. The artistry of fashion is being pushed beyond just aesthetics and moving into a more cerebral level.
For example, in his Fall/Winter 2021 show, French designer Ludovic de Saint Sernin created a collection inspired by the isolation and loneliness of the pandemic, with models walking alone down an empty runway. The clothes themselves were beautifully crafted, but it was the sense of melancholy and introspection that really resonated with the audience.
Provocation, too, is a key element of this new direction in men’s fashion. Designers like Gosha Rubchinskiy and Demna Gvasalia are using their platforms to make bold statements about everything from sexuality to politics. They are no longer just making clothes, but instead, using their collections as a form of artistic expression.
Of course, with all of this weirdness, emotion, and provocation comes some risk. Not every designer will be successful in pushing the boundaries of men’s fashion, and not every customer will be willing to embrace such unconventional designs. At times, designers run the risk of being seen as gimmicky or trying too hard.
Ultimately, however, what we are witnessing is a thrilling evolution of men’s fashion in Paris. These designers are moving beyond the confines of what has traditionally been considered “masculine” or “fashionable” and creating something truly new and exciting. Whether it’s weirdness, emotion, or provocation, there is no denying the impact that these designers are having on the fashion world.
