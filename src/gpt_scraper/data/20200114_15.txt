Delta Airplane Dumps Jet Fuel on Los Angeles Schools
On January 14, 2020, a Delta Air Lines flight bound for Shanghai was forced to return to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) shortly after takeoff due to an engine issue. In an effort to reduce the aircraft’s weight for landing, the pilots made the decision to dump fuel. Unfortunately, the fuel release resulted in dozens of schoolchildren and teachers being drenched in jet fuel as it fell from the sky.
The incident occurred over several elementary schools in the Los Angeles area, including Park Avenue Elementary, San Gabriel Avenue Elementary, and Tweedy Elementary. The fuel drenched playgrounds and students who were outside during recess or sports activities.
The school district immediately activated its emergency response protocols, and paramedics were dispatched to the affected schools. Over 50 students and teachers were treated for skin irritation and respiratory issues. Several of the affected students and teachers were taken to nearby hospitals for further treatment.
Parents and teachers were understandably outraged by the incident, with many questioning why the pilots did not choose to dump the fuel over less populated areas. Delta Air Lines issued a statement apologizing for the incident, stating that the pilots followed established procedures for fuel dumping but acknowledging that the incident had caused “concern and inconvenience.”
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched an investigation into the incident to determine whether Delta Air Lines had followed proper procedures for fuel dumping. The investigation also aimed to determine whether the schools had been properly notified of the fuel dumping, as required by federal regulations.
Fuel dumping is a common practice for airplanes experiencing mechanical issues shortly after takeoff. When an aircraft takes off, it is carrying a full load of fuel to ensure that it can complete its journey. However, if an emergency occurs that requires the aircraft to return to the airport, the weight of the fuel can make it unsafe for landing. In these cases, pilots may choose to dump fuel to reduce the weight of the aircraft.
Fuel dumping is typically done at high altitudes to allow the fuel to evaporate before it reaches the ground. However, in this case, the fuel was dumped at a lower altitude, resulting in it landing on several schools.
The incident has raised concerns about the safety of fuel dumping procedures and the need for better notification procedures. Many are calling for stricter regulations and more comprehensive safety protocols to be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
In conclusion, the Delta Airplane jet fuel dump on Los Angeles schools was a shocking incident that raised concerns about the safety of fuel dumping procedures. While investigations are ongoing, it is clear that stricter regulations and better notification procedures are needed to ensure the safety of all those who may be affected by fuel dumping.
