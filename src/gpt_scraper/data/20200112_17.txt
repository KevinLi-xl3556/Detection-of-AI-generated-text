The New Pope on HBO is the much-anticipated follow-up to the critically acclaimed series The Young Pope, which premiered in 2016. The new series features Jude Law as the young and charismatic Pope Pius XIII, who has fallen into a coma, leaving the Vatican in a state of turmoil. Enter John Malkovich as the new pope, Sir John Brannox, a charming and enigmatic English aristocrat who is chosen to lead the Catholic Church out of its crisis.
The New Pope is a visually stunning series, with beautiful cinematography and production design that captures the grandeur of the Vatican and the opulence of the papal lifestyle. The show is full of lush imagery, from the ornate costumes worn by the cardinals and bishops to the breathtaking views of Rome.
But what makes The New Pope truly compelling is its exploration of faith, hope, and the human condition. The show delves into complex issues such as religion, politics, power, and sexuality, challenging viewers to examine their own beliefs and values.
At the heart of The New Pope is the relationship between Pope John Paul III and his loyal assistant, Sister Mary, played by the talented and engaging actress, Silvio Orlando. Sister Mary is a devout Catholic who is deeply committed to her faith, but she is also a woman who has lived a full and complex life. Her interactions with the new pope are both touching and thought-provoking, as they grapple with the challenges facing the Catholic Church and their own personal struggles.
The New Pope also features an impressive cast of supporting actors, including Cécile de France as a French journalist investigating the Vatican, Henry Goodman as the ambitious Cardinal Spalletta, and Mark Ivanir as the troubled Cardinal Voiello.
One of the standout episodes of the series is “Third Episode,” which features a powerful and moving performance by Sharon Stone as a wealthy American who comes to the Vatican seeking a miracle. Stone’s character is at once vulnerable and manipulative, and her interactions with the pope and Sister Mary reveal a complex web of emotions and desires.
Overall, The New Pope is a must-watch for fans of intelligent, thought-provoking television. It is a beautifully crafted series that explores complex issues with sensitivity and nuance, and features outstanding performances from its cast. Whether you are a devout Catholic or a secular humanist, The New Pope is a show that will challenge you to examine your beliefs and values, and to think deeply about what it means to be human.
