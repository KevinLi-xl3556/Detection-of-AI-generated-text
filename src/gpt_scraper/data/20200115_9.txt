The Second-Biggest Diamond in History Has a New Owner
One of the world’s largest diamonds has been sold to a new owner for an estimated record-breaking price.
The diamond, known as the Lesedi La Rona, was discovered in 2015 in Botswana by Canadian mining company, Lucara Diamond Corp. This diamond is the second-largest in the world, with a weight of over 1100 carats.
After several attempts to sell the diamond at auctions, it remained unsold. However, Graff Diamonds, a British luxury jeweler, recently acquired the Lesedi La Rona for an undisclosed price. The sale is rumored to be valued at over $53 million.
The Lesedi La Rona is a Type IIa diamond, which is the purest and rarest type of diamond. Experts are predicting that the diamond will be cut into smaller pieces to create several high-end luxury pieces of jewelry.
The diamond’s previous owners, Lucara Diamond Corp, had hoped to auction the diamond in 2016 in a public sale in London. However, the highest bid, which was made by the British diamond dealer, Laurence Graff, was not enough to meet the reserve price, and the diamond was temporarily taken off the market.
The CEO of Graff Diamonds, Mr. Laurence Graff, said that he and his team have been working on the diamond for a long time, and they are delighted to have finally acquired it. They plan to incorporate the diamond into their private collection, which includes other notable diamonds such as the Graff Pink, which sold for $46 million in 2010.
The Lesedi La Rona, which means “our light” in the Tswana language, is considered a national treasure of Botswana. The government of Botswana had previously rejected an offer made by Lucara Diamond Corp, which offered to sell 10% of the diamond to the government. However, officials from the country have congratulated the new owners of the diamond, stating that they are excited to see what the diamond will be transformed into.
In conclusion, the Lesedi La Rona is a historically significant diamond that has captured the attention of many people worldwide. The recent sale of the diamond to Graff Diamonds for an estimated record-breaking price demonstrates the continued importance of diamond investment in the luxury market. We eagerly await the new pieces of jewelry that will undoubtedly be created from this magnificent diamond.
