Two critically acclaimed books are now available in paperback: Toni Morrison’s “The Source of Self-Regard” and Barry Lopez’s “Horizon.”
“The Source of Self-Regard” is a collection of Toni Morrison’s essays, speeches, and meditations on various topics, including literary criticism, race, gender, history, politics, and spirituality. The book is divided into three sections: “The Foreigner’s Home,” “Race Matters,” and “God’s Language.” In each section, Morrison shares her insights and perspectives on the complexities and contradictions of the human experience.
One of the most powerful essays in the book is “The Dead of September 11.” In it, Morrison reflects on the terrorist attacks of September 11, and what it reveals about the human capacity for violence and empathy. She writes, “Every citizen has responsibilities that are essential to our survival, and those responsibilities are love, compassion, and empathy.”
Another standout essay is “Women, Race, and Memory,” in which Morrison explores the intersectionality of gender and race. She argues that black women’s experiences are often dismissed or overlooked in discussions of feminism and civil rights. “Memory is the foundation of identity, and every identity is vulnerable to erasure,” she writes.
Overall, “The Source of Self-Regard” showcases Morrison’s brilliance as a writer and thinker. Her writing is insightful, illuminating, and deeply moving. It is a must-read for anyone interested in literature, politics, and the human condition.
“Horizon,” by Barry Lopez, is a travelogue that explores the author’s travels to six continents over the course of several decades. Lopez is known for his evocative descriptions of nature and his keen observations of the cultures and people he encounters along the way.
The book is divided into two parts: “Stories,” which recounts Lopez’s experiences traveling to places such as Antarctica, Australia, and Kenya, and “Essays,” which focuses on his reflections on topics such as environmentalism, spirituality, and art.
One of the most poignant essays in the book is “The Passing Wisdom of Birds,” in which Lopez reflects on the significance of birds in cultures around the world. He writes, “The world is full of stories about birds. They fly in our dreams, they appear in our myths, they have crept into our superstitions.”
Another standout essay is “The Rediscovery of Meaning,” in which Lopez argues that we have lost touch with the natural world and with our own sense of purpose. He writes, “We are losing faith in the world, and in ourselves. We are losing the sense that there is meaning in the world, that there is a reason why we are here.”
Overall, “Horizon” is a stunning achievement of prose and insight. Lopez’s writing is beautiful, lyrical, and thought-provoking. It is a book that will inspire readers to see the world in a new way and to reflect on their own place in the universe.
In conclusion, both “The Source of Self-Regard” and “Horizon” are exceptional books that deserve a place on any reader’s shelf. They are works of brilliance and beauty that offer insights into the human experience and the natural world. Whether you are interested in literature, travel, or philosophy, these books will not disappoint.
