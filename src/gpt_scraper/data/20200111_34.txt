Donald Trump Is a Hostage to 1979
Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is a man who is often criticized for being out of touch with the times. He is known for his divisive rhetoric, his tendency to stir up controversy, and his steadfast refusal to admit when he is wrong. But there is one area where Trump’s inability to move forward is particularly striking: his foreign policy, which seems to be frozen in the year 1979.
The year 1979 was a momentous one in world history. It was the year of the Iranian Revolution, which saw the overthrow of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini. It was the year that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, beginning a long and bloody conflict that would last for a decade. And it was the year that the United States experienced the first major terrorist attack on its soil, with the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
For Donald Trump, however, 1979 seems to be the only year that matters. He is obsessed with the events of that year, and he seems to view all of his foreign policy decisions through the lens of those events. This is particularly true when it comes to his approach to the Middle East.
Trump’s Middle East policy is based on a few key assumptions, all of which are rooted in the events of 1979. The first assumption is that the United States needs to be tough on Iran. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Obama administration for its efforts to negotiate with Iran, arguing that Iran cannot be trusted and that the only way to deal with the country is through force.
The second assumption is that the United States needs to support Israel at all costs. Trump has been a staunch ally of Israel since taking office, and he has gone out of his way to support the country in the face of international criticism.
The third assumption is that the United States needs to be skeptical of the Muslim world as a whole. Trump has repeatedly expressed his belief that Islam is a fundamentally violent religion, and he has sought to restrict travel from Muslim-majority countries.
All of these assumptions are rooted in the events of 1979. The Iranian Revolution created a regime that was hostile to the United States and Israel, and which sought to spread its revolutionary message throughout the Middle East. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan created a conflict that would help to destabilize the region for years to come. And the hostage crisis in Iran created an image of the Muslim world as a dangerous and unpredictable place.
The problem with Trump’s approach to foreign policy is that it is based on outdated assumptions that do not reflect the reality of the world today. Iran, for example, is a complex and multifaceted country that cannot be reduced to a caricature of a hostile regime. And the Muslim world is not a monolithic entity that can be painted with a broad brush.
Moreover, Trump’s obsession with 1979 has caused him to overlook other important events in world history that have shaped the Middle East. For example, he has paid little attention to the Arab Spring, which saw a wave of protests and uprisings across the region in 2011. He has also largely ignored the Syrian civil war, which has created a humanitarian crisis of staggering proportions.
In the end, Donald Trump’s foreign policy is a hostage to 1979. His inability to move beyond the events of that year has led him to adopt a simplistic and outdated approach to the Middle East, one that ignores the complexities of the region and the world as a whole. If the United States is to truly engage with the Middle East in a productive way, it will need to move beyond the ghosts of 1979 and embrace a more nuanced and forward-looking approach to foreign policy.
