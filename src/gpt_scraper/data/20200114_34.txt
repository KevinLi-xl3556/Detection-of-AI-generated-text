China is using its increasing global influence to silence critics and suppress dissent, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW). The report, titled “Bullying and Intimidation by China Abroad,” documents a pattern of harassment and intimidation by Chinese authorities against individuals and groups who speak out against the Chinese government or challenge its policies.
The report notes that China’s growing economic and diplomatic clout has given it a powerful tool to silence critics. As Chinese companies invest in and trade with countries around the world, they are able to pressure governments and businesses to adopt policies that align with Chinese interests. This has allowed China to use its economic leverage to stifle criticism of its human rights record and other controversial policies.
In addition to economic pressure, China has also used legal and diplomatic channels to intimidate and harass its critics. The report details cases of Chinese authorities filing baseless lawsuits against individuals and organizations critical of the government, as well as using diplomatic channels to pressure foreign governments to extradite or deport Chinese citizens who are critical of the regime.
One particularly troubling trend highlighted in the report is China’s use of its influence within international organizations to silence dissent. HRW notes that China has worked to fill key positions within the United Nations and other international organizations with individuals sympathetic to its agenda, allowing it to shape the global conversation on human rights and other issues in its favor.
The report also notes that China has sought to extend its influence over media and academic institutions abroad. Chinese media outlets and Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture, have come under scrutiny in recent years for their ties to the Chinese government and alleged efforts to influence public opinion. HRW notes that China has also sought to control academic discourse by pressuring universities to censor course material and disinvite speakers critical of the Chinese government.
Overall, the HRW report paints a disturbing picture of China’s efforts to suppress dissent and silence critics abroad. As China’s economic and diplomatic clout continue to grow, it is likely that these efforts will only intensify. The report calls on governments and businesses around the world to resist Chinese pressure and stand up for human rights and free expression, even when it may be politically or economically costly to do so.
