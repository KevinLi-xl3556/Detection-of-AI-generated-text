“How ‘The Irishman’ Maligns My Stepfather”
Martin Scorsese’s 2019 crime drama “The Irishman” is considered by many as a masterpiece, a cinematic triumph that explores the dark underbelly of organized crime in America. However, for some viewers, the film hits closer to home and brings up painful memories. For me, “The Irishman” maligns my stepfather and his legacy.
My stepfather, let’s call him Tom, was a devoted family man and a hardworking truck driver. He was also a proud Irish-American who had a deep love and respect for his heritage. Growing up, I always looked up to Tom as a role model, and his values and work ethic have shaped my own life in many ways.
So, when “The Irishman” was released, I was excited to watch it with Tom. I thought it would be a great opportunity to bond over our shared love of movies and our shared heritage. But as the film progressed, I began to feel uneasy. The characters in the movie were not like the Irish-Americans I knew, including Tom. Instead, they were violent, ruthless criminals who operated outside the law and showed little regard for human life.
The main character, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, is a hitman who claims to have killed Jimmy Hoffa, the famous labor leader who disappeared in 1975. In the movie, Sheeran is portrayed as a loyal soldier who follows orders without question, even when it means killing his friends. The film also depicts Sheeran as a lonely, regretful old man who is haunted by his past sins.
But this portrayal is far from accurate, according to Tom and many other Irish-Americans. In real life, Sheeran was a liar and a fraud who made up stories to sell books and make money. He never had any connection to Hoffa or the mafia, and his claims have been debunked by multiple sources.
Furthermore, Tom and other Irish-Americans take offense at the way the film portrays their heritage. They feel that “The Irishman” perpetuates negative stereotypes about Irish-Americans as violent, drunken thugs who are prone to criminal activity. This stereotype has a long history in America, dating back to the 19th century when Irish immigrants were often portrayed as a threat to American society.
In reality, Irish-Americans have made significant contributions to American society in a variety of fields, from politics to the arts to sports. They have also faced discrimination and prejudice, particularly in the early years of their immigration. To reduce them to caricatures of gangsters is not only inaccurate but also disrespectful.
“The Irishman” may be a great film, but for me and many others, it misses the mark in its portrayal of Irish-Americans and their culture. My stepfather Tom was a proud Irish-American who worked hard and loved his family. He was not a criminal or a murderer, and to see his heritage maligned in this way is deeply hurtful. I hope that future films can offer a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of Irish-Americans and their contributions to American society.
