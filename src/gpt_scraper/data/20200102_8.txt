Don Larsen Became an Unlikely Legend in 9 Perfect Innings
On October 8, 1956, Don Larsen achieved one of the most remarkable feats in baseball history. The little-known New York Yankees pitcher, who had a career record of 30-40 and was acquired by the Yankees in a trade just a few months prior, tossed a perfect game in the World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was a moment that would forever cement Larsen’s place in baseball folklore.
The perfect game, which lasted 97 minutes and 97 pitches, was the first and only perfect game in World Series history. It was a moment that seemed impossible for a pitcher like Larsen, who had been inconsistent throughout his career. In fact, his pitching was so erratic that he was almost removed from the game early on.
But the stars aligned for Larsen that day. He hit his spots and kept the Dodger batters off-balance with an arsenal of pitches that included fastballs, sliders, and curveballs. His catcher, Yogi Berra, also played a critical role in keeping the perfect game alive. Berra was known for his ability to call a great game and Larsen trusted him completely.
As the game went on, the tension in Yankee Stadium grew. The crowd was on its feet with every pitch as Larsen continued to retire Dodger after Dodger. When pinch-hitter Dale Mitchell stepped up to the plate in the top of the ninth inning, the crowd held its breath. Mitchell, who was known for his ability to put the ball in play, swung and missed at Larsen’s final pitch, a devastating curveball that sent the stadium into a frenzy.
Larsen had done the unthinkable. He had thrown a perfect game in the World Series, a feat that had never been accomplished before and has only been repeated once since. He had gone from a journeyman pitcher to a baseball legend overnight.
In the years that followed, Larsen embraced his newfound fame, recounting the day’s events countless times and making appearances at baseball events around the country. He understood the significance of what he had accomplished and took pride in being a part of baseball history.
Don Larsen passed away on January 1, 2020, at the age of 90. But his legacy will live on forever. His perfect game remains one of the most remarkable achievements in baseball history and a testament to the fact that anything is possible. Larsen may have been an unlikely legend, but he will always be remembered as one of the greatest pitchers to ever play the game.
