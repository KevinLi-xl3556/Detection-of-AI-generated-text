After more than two years of being banned, Turkey has finally lifted its restrictions on Wikipedia. The decision came after a ruling by the country’s top court that the ban violated freedom of expression.
The ban on Wikipedia began in April 2017, after the Turkish government accused the site of being part of a “smear campaign” against the country. The government claimed that Wikipedia had refused to remove content that linked Turkey to terrorist organizations, and that it had also allowed content that insulted the country’s leaders.
Since then, Turkish citizens have been unable to access the site, which is one of the world’s largest online encyclopedias. The ban has been a source of frustration for many in Turkey, who have relied on Wikipedia for information on a wide range of topics.
The decision to lift the ban was met with widespread relief and celebration among Turkish citizens. Many took to social media to express their joy at being able to access the site again. Some even thanked Wikipedia for fighting against the ban and for defending freedom of expression.
In a statement, Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that runs Wikipedia, welcomed the decision, saying that it was a victory for freedom of expression and access to information. The foundation also praised the Turkish people for their perseverance in fighting against the ban.
However, the foundation also acknowledged that the decision was just the first step in restoring access to Wikipedia in Turkey. It noted that the site would need to be unblocked by internet service providers, and that access to it would need to be restored to all parts of the country.
The decision to lift the ban was not without its critics, however. Some members of the Turkish government have voiced their opposition to the ruling, arguing that it undermines the country’s sovereignty and security.
Despite these concerns, the lifting of the ban is seen as a positive development for freedom of expression in Turkey. It is hoped that the decision will pave the way for greater openness and transparency in the country, and for a more informed and engaged citizenry.
In conclusion, the lifting of the ban on Wikipedia in Turkey is a welcome development. It represents a victory for freedom of expression and access to information, and it is hoped that it will lead to greater openness and transparency in the country. While there are still challenges ahead in fully restoring access to the site, this decision is a positive step forward for Turkey and its people.
