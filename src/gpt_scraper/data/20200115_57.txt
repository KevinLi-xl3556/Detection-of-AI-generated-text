In a landmark decision, a federal judge has halted a controversial policy initiated by President Donald Trump that allowed states to bar refugees from settling within their borders.
The policy, which was introduced last year, gave states the power to veto the resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions. This move was criticized by human rights advocates as a violation of federal law and an affront to the country’s tradition of welcoming refugees.
In his ruling, Judge Peter J. Messitte of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland said that the Trump administration had exceeded its authority by creating a policy that gave state and local governments a veto power over the resettlement of refugees.
“The [executive order] does not appear to serve the overall public interest,” Judge Messitte wrote. “In fact, it appears to frustrate it…”
The judge’s ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought by three refugee resettlement agencies that argued that the Trump policy created confusion and uncertainty about the resettlement process, and placed an undue burden on refugees seeking to rebuild their lives in the United States.
The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, was among the state officials who had exercised the power granted by the Trump policy to refuse the resettlement of refugees in his state. The governor’s move had been widely criticized by human rights groups and refugee advocates.
The judge’s ruling will now allow refugees who come to the United States under the federal resettlement program to settle anywhere in the country, without fear of being turned away by state and local officials.
The decision is a major victory for refugee resettlement agencies, which had argued that the Trump policy would reduce the number of refugees who are able to settle in the United States and create additional obstacles for those already facing difficult circumstances.
Human rights advocates praised the ruling as a major step forward in the fight to protect refugees and asylum seekers from the Trump administration’s harsh policies.
“The decision is a critical rebuke of the Trump administration’s attempts to undermine the refugee resettlement program and to politicize the issue of refugee admissions,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, one of the resettlement agencies involved in the lawsuit.
The Trump administration has not yet indicated whether it will appeal the ruling, but the decision is likely to face continued legal challenges from the administration and its allies.
In the meantime, however, the judge’s decision provides a critical reprieve for refugees seeking to start new lives in the United States, and reaffirms the country’s longstanding commitment to providing safe haven to those fleeing persecution and violence around the world.
