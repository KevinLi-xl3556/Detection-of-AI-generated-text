Why ISIS Is Delighted That Suleimani Is Dead
The recent killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Suleimani has sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East and beyond. While some see this as a significant blow to Iran’s influence in the region, others believe it will only lead to more violence and instability. One group that is undoubtedly thrilled with Suleimani’s demise is ISIS.
ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, is a jihadist militant group that at its peak controlled large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. While the group has been weakened in recent years, it still poses a significant threat to regional stability and international security. So, why is ISIS so happy that Suleimani is dead?
Firstly, it’s important to understand the complex web of relationships and alliances that exist in the Middle East. Iran has long been a major player in the region, supporting various militant groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Suleimani was seen as the architect of this Iranian policy, and his death is a significant blow to Iran’s regional ambitions.
However, this also means that Iran’s proxies in the region, including various Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, are now vulnerable. These militias were instrumental in the fight against ISIS, and their weakened state could create a power vacuum that ISIS could exploit.
Furthermore, Suleimani’s death has also created a sense of chaos and confusion in the region. This uncertainty could make it easier for ISIS to operate, as the focus of regional powers is now on internal divisions rather than the fight against militant groups.
In addition to all of this, Suleimani was also a key figure in the fight against ISIS. He played a major role in coordinating various forces on the ground, including the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. His death could disrupt these operations and lead to a resurgence in ISIS’s activity.
Finally, ISIS and Iran are bitter enemies, with the former seeing the latter as a sectarian Shia power trying to establish hegemony over the Sunni-dominated region. Suleimani’s death is seen as a victory for the Sunni jihadists, and they will undoubtedly try to capitalize on this.
In conclusion, the killing of Qassem Suleimani may have been seen as a victory for some in the region, but it has also created an opening for ISIS. The militant group will undoubtedly try to exploit the chaos and confusion that has now engulfed the Middle East, and this could lead to a resurgence in its activity. The fight against ISIS is far from over, and the death of one man may prove to be a pyrrhic victory in the long run.
