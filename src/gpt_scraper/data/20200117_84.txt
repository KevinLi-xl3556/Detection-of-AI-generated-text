An Old Army Myth That Went Unchallenged for Too Long
For decades, armies across the world have upheld certain myths and traditions that have remained largely unchallenged. One such myth, widely believed by soldiers, was that it was necessary to break in new boots before going on operations or long marches. This belief persisted despite a lack of evidence to support it and, in many cases, caused unnecessary discomfort and even injury among soldiers.
The origins of this myth are unclear, but it is likely to have emerged during the early days of modern armies. Soldiers, often conscripted and lacking prior military training, may have received ill-fitting or uncomfortable boots. The break-in period, during which the boots would stretch and mold to the shape of the wearer’s foot, was thus seen as a necessary step before embarking on any demanding activities. Over time, this practice became entrenched in military culture, despite a lack of evidence to support its effectiveness.
In recent years, however, scientific studies have shown that the belief in the necessity of a break-in period is largely misplaced. While it is true that leather boots can stretch slightly when worn, the difference is minimal and unlikely to significantly impact comfort or fit. Furthermore, modern manufacturing techniques have made it possible to create boots that are comfortable and ready to wear straight out of the box.
The persistence of this myth has led to unnecessary discomfort and injury among soldiers. Breaking-in boots involves wearing them for extended periods, often leading to blisters, sore feet, and other foot-related injuries. In some cases, soldiers may have continued to wear boots that were not suitable for them, believing that the discomfort was a natural part of the process.
Fortunately, the military has begun to dispel this myth in recent years. Many armies now provide soldiers with pre-broken boots, negating the need for a break-in period. This has led to more comfortable and effective footwear for soldiers, and has reduced the incidence of foot-related injuries.
In conclusion, the belief in the need for a break-in period for new boots is an old army myth that has persisted for too long. While it may have originated from practical concerns in the past, it has been shown to be largely ineffective and has caused unnecessary discomfort and injury among soldiers. The military’s move towards pre-broken boots is a welcome step towards more effective and comfortable footwear for soldiers, and a reminder that traditional practices should always be challenged and questioned in the quest for improvement.
