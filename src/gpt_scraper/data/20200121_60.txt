After months of tension and retaliatory measures, France and the United States appear to be edging closer to a temporary truce in their ongoing trade war.
The dispute centers around France’s Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 3% tax on the revenues of certain digital companies with global revenues of over €750 million, including big tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. The U.S. government argues that the tax unfairly targets American companies and violates international trade rules.
In response, the U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4 billion worth of French goods, including champagne, cheese, and handbags. France has threatened to retaliate with tariffs of its own, raising the specter of a wider transatlantic trade war.
However, recent developments suggest that both sides are willing to explore a temporary truce to avoid further escalation.
In early January, France announced that it would suspend collection of the Digital Services Tax until December 2020 in order to give time for ongoing negotiations at the OECD to reach a multilateral agreement on digital taxation. The U.S. responded by suspending plans for its retaliatory tariffs, although it stopped short of lifting the threat entirely.
In mid-February, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin traveled to Paris for a meeting with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. Following the meeting, Le Maire announced that both sides had reached a “very good agreement” and that “there won’t be any American tariffs on French goods… we consider that the agreement we have reached is good enough.”
Details of the agreement have not been released, but both sides have acknowledged that it includes a commitment to continue negotiating at the OECD in order to reach a multilateral agreement on digital taxation. The U.S. has also reportedly agreed to hold off on any further retaliation until at least the end of the year.
While the temporary truce has been welcomed by both sides, it should be noted that the underlying issues are far from resolved. The OECD negotiations are likely to be lengthy and complex, and there is no guarantee of reaching a satisfactory outcome. In addition, the Trump administration has been critical of the OECD process and may choose to take unilateral action if it feels the negotiations are not moving quickly enough or producing the desired results.
For now, however, both France and the U.S. have taken a step back from the trade war brink. This is welcome news for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, who stand to suffer if the dispute was to escalate further. A temporary truce is not a permanent solution, but it is a promising sign that cooler heads are prevailing and that negotiations are underway to find a long-term resolution.
