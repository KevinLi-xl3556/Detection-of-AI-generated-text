Tracy Letts is a name that many moviegoers may not recognize, but the American actor and playwright has been a force in Hollywood in recent years. In 2019, Letts appeared in the sports drama “Ford v Ferrari,” and his performance in one particular scene left audiences stunned.
“Ford v Ferrari” tells the story of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari during the 1960s, specifically the lead-up to the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1966. The film stars Matt Damon as American car designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as British driver Ken Miles. Letts plays Henry Ford II, the CEO of Ford Motor Company.
The scene in question takes place during a test drive of the Ford GT40, a car designed to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Letts’ character, Ford, is brought along for the ride with Shelby and Miles. As they speed around the track, Ford becomes increasingly terrified and eventually orders Miles to stop the car. Letts’ performance in this scene is nothing short of extraordinary.
Letts captures the fear and vulnerability of a man who is used to being in control but is suddenly faced with his own mortality. His facial expressions and body language convey a sense of panic and desperation that is palpable. It’s a masterclass in acting, and one that has left many viewers in awe.
Letts’ scene in “Ford v Ferrari” is just one example of his talents as an actor. He has received critical acclaim for his performances in films like “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” as well as his work on stage. Letts won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2008 for his play “August: Osage County,” which was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.
Overall, Tracy Letts is a powerhouse performer who deserves more recognition for his work. His scene in “Ford v Ferrari” is just one example of his ability to captivate audiences and leave them speechless. If you haven’t seen the film yet, it’s worth watching for Letts’ performance alone.
