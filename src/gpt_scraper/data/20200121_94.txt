In the race to be President of the United States, having strong support from the Black community is crucial for any candidate. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has long touted his support from African Americans, but in recent months, some have expressed doubts. However, Biden has dismissed these doubts, telling critics that “you know better. You know better.”
Biden’s statement came during a virtual town hall meeting with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on September 23rd. The meeting came as a way for Biden to connect with Black voters and talk about his plans for addressing systemic racism if he is elected.
During the town hall, Biden was asked about the concerns Black voters may have about his candidacy. He specifically addressed a recent polling data that showed a dip in his support among African Americans. Biden responded by saying “We have to earn our votes every time we run. Nobody’s vote should be taken for granted.”
However, Biden quickly pivoted, acknowledging that he had been supported by African Americans throughout his political career. “I’ve never, ever, ever, ever taken for granted the African American community,” said Biden. “I’ve been supported by them. I’ve won because of them. And so, by the way, I’ve overwhelming support. You all know it. You all know it.”
Some may see Biden’s response as dismissive or defensive, but others may interpret it as confidence in his support from the Black community. Throughout his campaign, Biden has emphasized his commitment to criminal justice reform, addressing systemic racism, and economic opportunities for Black Americans.
Despite concerns about his age and suitability for office, Biden’s campaign has maintained that he is the best candidate for upholding the rights and protections of all Americans, including the Black community. The recent controversy surrounding the death of Breonna Taylor and the ongoing protests against systemic racism have only underscored the importance of addressing these issues head-on, and Biden has promised to do just that.
As the election approaches, both Biden and his opponent Donald Trump will be vying for the support of Black voters. While some may question the sincerity of Biden’s commitment to those issues that matter most to African Americans, his long history of garnering support from the Black community speaks for itself. Ultimately, the decision of who to vote for will be up to individual voters, but it is clear that Joe Biden will continue to emphasize the importance of Black support as he tries to win the presidency.
