As the world continues to turn, the news never stops. Here is your Thursday briefing on three major topics currently making headlines: the Wuhan coronavirus, Brexit, and the Australian Open.
The Wuhan coronavirus, which first emerged in the city of Wuhan in China, has now spread to various countries around the world. The virus has infected over 7,000 people and caused over 170 deaths as of January 30th. Governments around the world, including the United States, have taken measures to contain the virus and prevent further spreading. Many airlines have cancelled flights to and from China, and some countries are quarantining citizens who have recently traveled to affected areas. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global emergency and is working with countries to coordinate a response.
Brexit, the United Kingdom’s plan to withdraw from the European Union, is still a topic of uncertainty and debate. On January 31st, the UK is set to officially leave the EU, but the details of their future relationship with the EU is still unclear. Negotiations on trade, security, and other key issues are expected to continue throughout the year. The UK government has promised that Brexit will bring new opportunities for the country, but many experts are still concerned about the potential economic impact of the move.
Finally, in the world of sports, the Australian Open tennis tournament is currently underway in Melbourne. The first Grand Slam event of the year, the tournament features some of the world’s top players, including Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The tournament has already seen its share of upsets, with top-seeded players like Naomi Osaka and Alexander Zverev being knocked out in the early rounds. The tournament will continue until February 2nd, when the men’s singles final will take place.
