The Senate, on Thursday (Jan. 16), passed the revised version of the 25-year-old trade agreement known as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Senate’s approval comes after months of debate and negotiations between the Trump administration and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) brings significant changes to the original NAFTA, which went into effect in 1994. The new deal includes updated rules on labor and automotive manufacturing, as well as provisions on digital trade and intellectual property. It also includes new provisions aimed at supporting American farmers and boosting U.S. production of steel and aluminum.
For years, President Trump has railed against NAFTA, calling it a “disaster” for American workers and industry, and pledged to renegotiate the deal. The USMCA represents one of his administration’s biggest victories, fulfilling a key campaign promise.
Despite concerns from some Democrats about the new deal’s labor and environmental protections, the USMCA passed the Senate with bipartisan support, by a vote of 89 to 10.
In a statement released shortly after the Senate’s decision, President Trump praised the agreement, calling it a “massive win” for American farmers, workers, and businesses. “This is a colossal victory for our farmers, ranchers, energy workers, factory workers, and American workers in all 50 states,” Trump said. “The USMCA is the largest, most significant, modern, and balanced trade agreement in history.”
The passage of the USMCA is likely to have a significant impact on the economies of the three countries involved. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, the deal is expected to bring an increase in U.S. economic growth of 0.35% and a boost in exports of $27 billion.
The new trade agreement will also provide greater market access for U.S. goods and services, particularly in the agriculture, technology, and energy sectors. For example, the USMCA eliminates Canada’s Class 7 dairy program, which restricted imports of U.S. dairy products, and provides new protections for American intellectual property.
The USMCA now heads to President Trump’s desk for his signature. Upon signing, the deal will then be ratified by Canada, which is expected to happen without significant opposition. The agreement will then need to be passed by Mexican lawmakers.
In conclusion, the passage of the USMCA represents a significant milestone for American trade policy, particularly in light of the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. It remains to be seen how the new agreement will impact businesses, workers, and consumers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, but supporters believe it will lead to increased economic growth and job creation across North America.
