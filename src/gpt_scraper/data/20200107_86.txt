When Rear Admiral Habibollah “Habeeb” Sayyari was just nine years old, he fled Iran with his family during the country’s revolution in 1979. Little did he know then that he would go on to become a commanding officer in the United States Navy, leading one of the most advanced and powerful warships in the world.
Sayyari’s journey to the top of the naval ranks was far from easy. After arriving in the United States as a child, he faced many challenges, including learning a new language and adapting to a new culture. However, he persevered and eventually joined the Navy in 1981, motivated by a desire to serve his adopted country and repay the opportunities it had given him.
Sayyari’s early years in the Navy were marked by hard work and dedication. He quickly rose through the ranks, serving on a variety of ships and in a variety of roles. His skills and leadership abilities did not go unnoticed, and he was eventually selected to attend the prestigious Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.
Following his graduation from the War College, Sayyari continued to excel in his career, taking on increasingly important roles within the Navy. He served as the Executive Officer of the USS Nimitz, one of the Navy’s largest and most powerful aircraft carriers, before being appointed as the commanding officer of the USS Kitty Hawk, another carrier in the fleet.
Sayyari’s experience and leadership skills were put to the test during his time commanding the Kitty Hawk. Under his leadership, the ship participated in a number of high-profile missions, including supporting the U.S. response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and providing humanitarian aid to earthquake victims in Pakistan.
Sayyari’s impressive track record did not go unnoticed, and he was eventually appointed as the commander of Carrier Strike Group 2, a group of ships that included the USS George H.W. Bush, one of the Navy’s most advanced aircraft carriers. In this role, Sayyari oversaw a range of missions and operations, including supporting U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and conducting freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea.
Sayyari’s success in the Navy is a testament to his determination, hard work, and leadership skills. Despite facing numerous obstacles and challenges throughout his life, he has risen to the top of his profession and continues to serve his country with distinction. His story is a reminder of the incredible opportunities that America offers to those who are willing to work hard and pursue their dreams.
