It’s been an eventful week in the 2020 presidential race, with endorsements and surprising debate performances shaking up the political landscape. However, one issue that has dominated headlines is Iran and the escalating tensions between the United States and the Middle Eastern nation.
The week began with news that Iran had surpassed the uranium enrichment limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This move came after the Trump administration withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and imposed sanctions on Iran, prompting the country to retaliate.
In response, the U.S. has sent additional troops to the region, and President Trump has threatened Iran with “obliteration” if it continues to provoke the U.S. military. The situation has put foreign policy and national security front and center in the presidential race, with candidates offering their own takes on how to handle the situation.
Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, endorsements have been making waves. Former Vice President Joe Biden received the endorsement of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who dropped out of the race last year. The endorsement was seen as a significant boost for Biden, as Harris is a popular figure among Democrats and could help him appeal to key demographics, including women and people of color.
However, another endorsement caused a stir in the race this week, as progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announced her support for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement is seen as a blow to the other progressive candidate in the race, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been struggling to gain traction in recent weeks.
But perhaps the biggest surprise of the week came during the Democratic debate on Wednesday night, where former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made his debut appearance. Bloomberg, who has been spending heavily on advertising and building a ground game in states yet to vote, had a rocky performance, with other candidates attacking him over his past comments and policies, particularly regarding women and people of color.
Despite the criticism, Bloomberg has vowed to stay in the race, and his presence on the stage could continue to shake up the race in the weeks to come.
As the primaries continue, the race remains fluid, with candidates vying for endorsements and trying to set themselves apart on key issues. But with Iran and foreign policy now taking center stage, the stakes have never been higher for the candidates vying to be the next president of the United States.
