Medicine in the Middle Ages
The Middle Ages, also known as the Medieval period, spanned roughly from the 5th century to the 15th century AD. During this time, Europe saw great changes in the fields of art, culture, and science. One area of study that was particularly important during this era was medicine. In this article, we will explore the medical practices of the Middle Ages, including the beliefs, treatments, and medical practitioners of the time.
Beliefs about Medicine
The people of the Middle Ages had a complex and often superstitious view of medicine. They believed that health was governed by the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These humors were thought to be responsible for a person’s physical and mental health, and any imbalance between them could lead to illness.
The Middle Ages also saw the rise of the idea of miasma, or “bad air,” as a cause of disease. People believed that disease was caused by breathing in bad air, and so they often tried to avoid it by staying indoors or wearing masks.
Treatments
Given their beliefs about the causes of disease, it is perhaps not surprising that the medical treatments of the Middle Ages often involved bloodletting, or the intentional removal of blood from the body. This was thought to help balance the humors and promote healing.
Other treatments included the use of herbal remedies, which were often administered in the form of poultices or teas. Some of these remedies, such as willow bark (which contains salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin), are still used in modern medicine today.
Surgery was also practiced during the Middle Ages, although it was often performed without anesthesia or antiseptics. Surgeons would sometimes use opium or alcohol to dull the pain, and they would often wash their hands and tools in wine or vinegar to help prevent infection.
Medical Practitioners
The medical practitioners of the Middle Ages were a diverse group, ranging from university-trained physicians to wandering healers and midwives. The most highly respected practitioners were the physicians, who were typically educated in universities and trained in the theories of ancient Greek and Roman medicine.
However, many people could not afford the services of a physician, and so they turned to local healers and midwives for medical care. These practitioners often relied on folk remedies and herbal medicine, and they were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the medical establishment.
Conclusion
Medicine in the Middle Ages was a complex and often superstitious field of study. Despite the limitations of their knowledge and technology, however, the medical practitioners of the time made important contributions to the development of medicine as a science. Their beliefs and practices laid the foundation for the modern medical practices that we take for granted today.
