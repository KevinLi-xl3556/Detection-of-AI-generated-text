Peter Larkin, Stage Designer With a Funky Asterisk, Dies at 93
Peter Larkin, a prominent stage designer known for his funky and unconventional approach to theatrical productions, has passed away at the age of 93. Larkin, who started his career designing sets for puppet shows and children’s theater, went on to create stunning and innovative stage designs for some of the most celebrated productions of his time.
Larkin’s career spanned several decades, during which he collaborated with some of the biggest names in theater. He worked with director Robert Wilson on several productions, including the acclaimed “Einstein on the Beach,” which premiered in 1976. Larkin also designed sets for Broadway productions, including “The Iceman Cometh” and “The Crucible.”
What set Larkin apart from other stage designers was his knack for incorporating unexpected elements into his designs. He was not afraid to shake up traditional theatrical conventions and was known for adding a touch of humor and whimsy to his sets. Larkin often used asymmetrical designs, bold colors, and abstract shapes in his sets, creating a surreal and dream-like atmosphere on stage.
Larkin’s designs were not only visually stunning but also deeply meaningful. He used his sets to comment on social and political issues, addressing topics such as war, racism, and the environment. His designs were often layered with symbolism, inviting the audience to explore deeper meanings and interpretations.
Despite his many achievements and accolades, including winning two Tony Awards, Larkin remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He believed that the purpose of theater was to connect with the audience and evoke an emotional response. He once said, “I try to make the set as honest and as alive as the actors. I want the audience to feel like they are stepping into a different world.”
Larkin’s legacy continues to inspire and influence stage designers today. His bold and unconventional approach to theatrical design has paved the way for a new generation of designers to experiment and push boundaries.
As news of Larkin’s passing spreads, tributes are pouring in from the theater community. Playwright Tony Kushner, who worked with Larkin on the revival of “Angels in America,” called Larkin “a genius” and praised him for his “infectious joy.” Director Julie Taymor, who collaborated with Larkin on “The Lion King,” remembered him as “a true original” and “a brilliant artist.”
Peter Larkin may have passed away, but his influence on theater will continue to be felt for years to come. He leaves behind a rich legacy of innovative and meaningful stage designs that will continue to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.
