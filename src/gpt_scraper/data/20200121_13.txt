The Census Begins Where It Has Struggled Before: Remote, Frozen Alaska
The census is a vital exercise carried out by the United States government every ten years. It involves collecting information about the population, which is then used to determine various aspects of life, such as how federal funds are allocated, how many representatives each state should have in Congress, and more. However, not all parts of the country make the census easy. One prime example of this is remote, frozen Alaska.
Alaska is the largest state in the country and has a population of just over 731,000 people. The state is also home to many indigenous communities, who live in remote areas that are often difficult to access. These communities have historically been undercounted in previous censuses, leading to various issues such as insufficient federal funding and inaccurate representation in Congress.
The 2020 census faces additional challenges in Alaska due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has made travelling to remote areas even more difficult and dangerous. Additionally, many members of these communities are wary of outsiders due to fears of the virus being brought in from the outside world.
To overcome these challenges, Census Bureau officials have implemented various strategies. These include hiring more census takers from within Alaskaâ€™s own communities, working with local leaders, and offering the option for households to self-respond to the census online or over the phone.
Despite these efforts, there are still concerns about the accuracy of the count. Many remote communities lack reliable internet and phone service, making it difficult for residents to self-respond. Additionally, language barriers and cultural differences can make it challenging for census takers to connect with locals and gather information accurately.
The impact of an inaccurate count in Alaska could be significant. Underfunded schools, inadequate medical care, and poor transportation infrastructure are just a few examples of the consequences of an undercount. Accurate representation in Congress is also essential to ensure that the voices of Alaskans are heard at the national level.
In conclusion, the census is an essential process that helps determine how our government functions. However, it is not without its challenges, as seen in remote areas like Alaska. The Census Bureau has implemented various strategies to ensure an accurate count, but it remains to be seen how effective they will be. One thing is certain - an accurate census count in Alaska is vital to ensuring the needs of these remote communities are met.
