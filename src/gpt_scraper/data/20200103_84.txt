The Killing of Gen. Qassim Suleimani: What We Know Since the U.S. Airstrike
On January 3, 2020, a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport, sparking fears of a major conflict between the United States and Iran. Since then, much has been speculated about the killing and its implications. In this article, we will look at what we know since the U.S. airstrike.
Who was Qassim Suleimani?
General Qassim Suleimani was a powerful figure in Iran, serving as the commander of the Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for Iran’s extraterritorial military and intelligence operations. He was widely considered to be one of the most influential people in the Middle East, and he played a key role in Iran’s military and foreign policy for decades.
Why was he targeted?
The U.S. government justified the airstrike on the grounds that Suleimani was planning imminent attacks on American interests in the region. According to U.S. officials, Suleimani had been involved in the planning of attacks on U.S. forces and interests in Iraq and throughout the region, and the airstrike was carried out to prevent these attacks from happening.
What was the reaction to the killing?
The killing of Suleimani was met with mixed reactions in the Middle East and around the world. In Iran, there was widespread anger and mourning for the loss of a national hero, and Iran vowed to retaliate against the United States. Tensions between the two countries escalated rapidly, with Iran launching a missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq in response to the killing.
The international community expressed concern about the possibility of a wider conflict in the region, with many countries urging restraint and diplomacy. The United Nations Security Council also held a meeting to discuss the situation, but failed to agree on a joint statement.
What has happened since then?
Since the killing of Suleimani, tensions between the United States and Iran have remained high, with both sides engaging in a war of words and occasional military actions. Iran has continued to vow revenge for the killing, and there have been several incidents of attacks on U.S. targets in the region, including a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
The Biden administration has taken steps to deescalate tensions with Iran, including rejoining the nuclear deal and engaging in talks with Iranian officials. However, there are still concerns about the possibility of a wider conflict in the region, and the killing of Suleimani remains a contentious issue between the two countries.
Conclusion
The killing of Qassim Suleimani was a significant event that has had far-reaching consequences for the United States, Iran, and the wider Middle East. While the U.S. government justified the airstrike on the grounds of preventing imminent attacks on American interests, the killing has been widely criticized for its legality and potential to escalate tensions in the region.
Since the airstrike, tensions between the United States and Iran have remained high, with both sides engaging in occasional military actions and rhetoric. While the Biden administration has taken steps to deescalate tensions, the killing of Suleimani remains a contentious issue that will likely continue to shape the relationship between the two countries in the years to come.
