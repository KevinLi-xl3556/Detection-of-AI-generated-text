Quotation of the Day: Democratic Candidates Struggle to Win the Trust of Black Voters
With the 2020 US presidential election approaching ever closer, the candidates are beginning to hit the campaign trail in earnest. However, as they try to win over voters from all backgrounds, one group has proven particularly challenging to win the trust of - black voters.
In a recent interview, civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said, “Black voters don’t just want promises; they want action.”
This sentiment is echoed by many in the black community, who are skeptical of politicians who make big promises during election season but then fail to follow through once they are in office. Black voters have traditionally been one of the most reliable voting blocs for the Democratic party, but recent polls suggest they are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the political establishment.
One issue that has been particularly contentious is criminal justice reform. Black Americans are disproportionately affected by police brutality and mass incarceration, and many are calling for concrete measures to be taken to address these issues. However, some candidates’ past records on criminal justice reform have come under scrutiny, leaving them open to accusations of insincerity.
Joe Biden, who recently announced his candidacy for president, has been criticized for his role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, which many say contributed to the mass incarceration of black Americans. Kamala Harris, another Democratic candidate, has faced backlash over her record as Attorney General of California, during which she opposed the release of certain nonviolent offenders.
In order to win over black voters, candidates must do more than just pay lip service to the issues that matter to them. They must be willing to listen to the concerns of the community, engage with activists and experts, and propose real solutions that will make a difference in the lives of black Americans.
As Reverend Sharpton said, “It’s not about speeches, it’s not about rallies; it’s about policies that make a difference in the lived experiences of black people.”
If Democratic candidates want to win the trust of black voters, they must prove that they have the courage and conviction to fight for justice and equality, not just during election season, but throughout their time in office.
