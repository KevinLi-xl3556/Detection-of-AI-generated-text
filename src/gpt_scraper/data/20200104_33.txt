How to Buy? Say You’ll Sell.
Are you looking to make a purchase, but unsure how to negotiate the best deal? One tried and true method is to utilize the power of persuasion by saying you’ll sell.
This technique involves presenting the seller with the idea that if they lower their price, you will in turn sell their product to others and bring them more business. This presents a win-win situation for both the buyer and the seller, as the buyer gets a better price and the seller potentially gains more customers.
Here are a few tips to successfully execute this method:


Do your research: Before approaching the seller with this technique, make sure you have a solid understanding of the product, its value, and the market demand. This will give you more credibility and bargaining power in your negotiations.


Use your network: If you have a large network and the potential to bring in more customers, mention this to the seller. They may be more inclined to offer you a better deal if they see the potential for increased business.


Build rapport: Be friendly and respectfully negotiate with the seller. Show genuine interest in their product and ask questions to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding. This can help to build a good relationship and increase the chances of getting a better deal.


Be confident: Confidence is key in any negotiation. If you believe in your ability to sell the product, the seller is more likely to have faith in you as well. This can help to create a sense of trust between the buyer and seller and make the transaction smoother.


Overall, saying you’ll sell can be a powerful technique to negotiate a better deal when buying. By showcasing your potential as a customer and promoter of the product, you may be able to secure a lower price and foster a positive relationship with the seller. Happy buying!
