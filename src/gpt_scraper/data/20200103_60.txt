In the world of opera, there are countless masterpieces that have stood the test of time and continue to captivate audiences all over the world. However, there are also many lesser-known works that have been forgotten over the years, languishing in obscurity while more popular operas take center stage. But sometimes, these forgotten works can make a big comeback, surprising audiences with their beauty and brilliance. In this article, we will explore the story of one such opera that has recently made a triumphant return to the stage.
The opera in question is called “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau,” which translates to “The Postilion of Lonjumeau.” It was written by Adolphe Adam, a French composer who lived in the 19th century. “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau” premiered in Paris in 1836 and was an instant hit, quickly becoming one of the most popular operas of its time. However, as the years went by, the opera fell out of favor and was largely forgotten.
That is, until a few years ago, when a small opera company in France decided to revive the work. The company, called Opéra Comique, specializes in producing lesser-known operas, so “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau” was a natural fit for them. They staged a new production of the opera in 2019, and it was a resounding success.
The story of “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau” is a charming and lighthearted one. It follows the adventures of Chapelou, a young postilion (a person who rides in the saddle of the lead horse of a carriage) who has a beautiful singing voice. He falls in love with a soprano named Madeleine, who also happens to be the daughter of the local innkeeper. However, Madeleine’s father has promised her hand in marriage to a wealthy nobleman, and Chapelou’s lowly station in life seems to make their love impossible. But when the king of France hears Chapelou sing, he is so impressed that he elevates him to the rank of baron, making him a suitable match for Madeleine. The opera ends with a joyful celebration of their love and Chapelou’s newfound status.
One of the reasons why “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau” fell out of favor in the 20th century was because of its demanding vocal requirements. The role of Chapelou is particularly challenging, requiring a tenor with a strong upper register and an ability to hit high notes with ease. However, the tenor who performed the role in Opéra Comique’s production, Michael Spyres, proved more than up to the task. His virtuosic singing was one of the highlights of the production, and it helped to showcase the opera’s many musical pleasures.
Another reason why “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau” has made a comeback is because of its relevance to our current moment. The opera’s themes of love, class, and social mobility feel particularly resonant in a time when many people are struggling to make ends meet and are looking for ways to rise above their circumstances. The opera’s message of hope and possibility is a welcome one in an age of cynicism and disillusionment.
All in all, the revival of “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau” is a heartwarming story of a forgotten work finding new life. It shows that there is still room in the world of opera for works that may have been overlooked in the past, and that with the right approach, these works can still captivate audiences today. As long as there are artists who are willing to take a chance on these forgotten gems, we can look forward to many more surprises and delights in the years to come.
