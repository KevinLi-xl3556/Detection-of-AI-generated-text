As the 2020 US Presidential Elections quickly approach, the field remains as crowded as ever. While the likes of Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have dominated the headlines of the Democratic primary, a handful of celebrities have also entered the race. This group includes veteran actor Danny Glover, television personality Judge Judy, and singer/actress Mandy Moore.
Although these celebrities are certainly well-known, their entrance into the race has been met with mixed reactions. Some believe that their fame and recognition will help to draw attention to important issues, while others feel that it takes away from the seriousness of the race.
Danny Glover, best known for his roles in popular movies such as “Lethal Weapon” and “The Color Purple,” has been a vocal activist for years. His primary platform focuses on topics like income inequality and systemic racism. While he has not held any political office, many believe that his years of activism make him a strong candidate.
Judge Judy, whose real name is Judy Sheindlin, has been a fixture on daytime television for over two decades. She is known for her no-nonsense attitude and is often viewed as a tough but fair judge. Her platform focuses on criminal justice reform and advocating for victims of domestic violence.
Mandy Moore, who started her career as a teenage pop star in the late 1990s, has since transitioned into acting. She is best known for her role on the hit television show “This Is Us.” Her platform focuses on issues related to family and child welfare, including access to affordable child care and reforming the foster care system.
Despite their shared celebrity status, these candidates have vastly different backgrounds and platforms. However, many have criticized their entrance into politics, arguing that it detracts from the seriousness of the election. Additionally, some worry that their celebrity status will overshadow important policy issues and distract from important debates.
Despite these concerns, the Celebrity Primary does raise important questions about the role of celebrities in the political process. While some may argue that their fame gives them an unfair advantage, others believe that their status can be used to draw attention to important issues.
Looking ahead, it remains to be seen how the Celebrity Primary will impact the overall race. While their presence may create additional media attention, it’s still unclear whether or not they will be able to capture the hearts and minds of the American people.
In the end, it’s up to voters to decide what qualities they’re looking for in a candidate, and whether or not they’re willing to support a celebrity in the White House. Until then, the 2020 Democratic Primary will continue to be a crowded and unpredictable field.
