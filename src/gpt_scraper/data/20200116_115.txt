Larry Kramer Wishes More People Wrote About Gay History
Larry Kramer was an American playwright, author, and activist who was one of the pioneers of the LGBT rights movement in the United States. He was also an outspoken advocate for gay history and believed that it was important for more people to write about it.
In an interview with The New York Times, Kramer expressed his disappointment with the lack of interest in gay history, saying, “I wish there were more people who wrote about gay history. I wish there were more people who were interested in it.”
Kramer’s activism was rooted in his own personal experiences as a gay man. He was born in 1935 and grew up in a time when being gay was considered a mental illness and a crime. He saw how society treated homosexuals and was appalled by the discrimination, violence, and stigma that they faced.
This led Kramer to become involved in the LGBT rights movement, and he played an instrumental role in founding a number of organizations that fought for gay rights, including the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP.
But for Kramer, it wasn’t just about fighting for gay rights in the present – it was also about preserving the history of the LGBT community. He believed that it was important for people to know about the struggles and triumphs of the LGBT community throughout history, and that this knowledge could be a powerful tool for social change.
Kramer’s call to action is more important now than ever. While there has been progress in terms of LGBT rights in recent years, there is still a lot of work to be done. Discrimination against the LGBT community still exists in many forms, and many people are still ignorant about the history and struggles of the LGBT community.
By writing about gay history, we can educate people about the contributions and sacrifices of the LGBT community throughout history, and help to create a better understanding and acceptance of the LGBT community in the present.
Larry Kramer passed away on May 27, 2020, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to gay rights and gay history inspired a generation of activists, authors, and scholars, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations to continue the fight for equality and justice.
In conclusion, Larry Kramer’s advocacy for gay history underscores the importance of recognizing and preserving the past while fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. He has shown how writing about gay history can create a more accepting and inclusive society, and it is our duty to continue his work by continuing to learn and teach about the important contributions of the LGBTQ+ community throughout history.
