The Work Diary of Anna Bond, Whose Work Includes … Making Diaries
Anna Bond is a woman who wears many hats. She’s an artist, a designer, an entrepreneur, and the co-founder of Rifle Paper Co. - a company known for their beautiful stationery and paper goods. Anna’s work is centered around creating products that inspire people to connect, create, and celebrate life’s moments. And perhaps one of the most fitting products that Anna creates is diaries - a tool that helps people keep track of their time and memories.
As someone who spends much of her day creating beautiful diaries, it’s no surprise that Anna herself is a lover of journals and planners. In fact, she has been keeping a work diary for years, and it has become an integral part of her daily routine.
Anna’s work diary is a place where she records everything from meetings and appointments to design ideas and creative inspiration. She starts each day by reviewing her previous entries and making a plan for the day ahead. Throughout the day, she takes notes on phone calls, brainstorming sessions, and anything else that comes up.
One of the things that Anna loves about keeping a work diary is that it helps her stay organized and focused. By writing down her goals and priorities, she’s able to stay on track and make progress towards her larger projects. It also helps her stay mindful of her time and avoid getting caught up in distractions.
But Anna’s work diary isn’t just a tool for productivity - it’s also a place for her to reflect and process her thoughts and emotions. As an artist, Anna is constantly seeking inspiration and exploring new ideas. She uses her diary as a place to capture those moments of inspiration and reflect on what they mean to her.
In addition to her work diary, Anna also keeps a personal journal. This is a place where she writes about her experiences, thoughts, and feelings outside of work. While her work diary is focused on productivity and creativity, her personal journal is a place for introspection and self-care.
For Anna, keeping a work diary is more than just a habit - it’s a way of life. It helps her stay organized, focused, and inspired, while also giving her a space to reflect and grow. And as someone who creates diaries for a living, it’s clear that Anna understands the value of this simple yet powerful tool.
So whether you’re an entrepreneur, artist, or simply someone looking to stay organized and focused, take a page from Anna’s book and start keeping a work diary. You might be surprised at how much it can transform your productivity, creativity, and overall well-being.
