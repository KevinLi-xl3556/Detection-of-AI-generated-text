On January 3, 2020, President Donald Trump made a stunning claim that four U.S. embassies had been targeted by Iranian forces. This announcement came just days after the United States assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian military commander, in a drone strike.
The claim was made during an interview with Fox News, where Trump defended the decision to kill Soleimani and suggested that the attack was necessary to prevent imminent attacks on U.S. embassies. When pressed for evidence, Trump simply stated that he had “reason to believe” that the embassies were in danger.
The claim immediately raised eyebrows, as no other U.S. officials had mentioned any threat to embassies prior to Trump’s comments. When pressed for more information, the White House was unable to provide any details or evidence to support the claim.
In the days following Trump’s announcement, several top officials within the U.S. government contradicted his claims. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that he had not seen any evidence of an imminent threat to embassies, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he did not know the specific targets that Trump was referring to.
The lack of evidence and conflicting statements from top officials led many to question the veracity of Trump’s claims. Some even accused him of exaggerating or fabricating the threat in order to justify the assassination of Soleimani.
Despite the controversy, Trump continued to defend his statements, insisting that he had been briefed on the threat to embassies and that the attack on Soleimani was justified. He also accused the media of downplaying the threat and spreading fake news.
In the end, it remains unclear whether or not there was an imminent threat to U.S. embassies in the region. The lack of evidence and conflicting statements from top officials only served to fuel speculation and controversy. However, what is clear is that Trump’s claim added to the already tense and volatile situation between the United States and Iran.
