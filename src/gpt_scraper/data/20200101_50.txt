Pete Buttigieg’s Campaign Says It Raised $24.7 Million in the Fourth Quarter
The Democratic primary race is heating up, with candidates vying for the nomination to take on President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. One of the top contenders, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, has announced that his campaign raised $24.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Buttigieg’s impressive fundraising numbers put him in the top tier of candidates in terms of financial resources. This is a significant achievement for a candidate who was relatively unknown at the beginning of the year and has only been in public office for a few years.
The Mayor’s campaign credits its success to a strong grassroots fundraising effort, with the average donation size being around $33. The campaign has also been successful in attracting high-dollar donors, with over 326,000 donors contributing to the campaign in the fourth quarter alone.
Buttigieg has also gained momentum in the polls, consistently placing in the top four candidates in national polls. He has also performed well in early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where he has invested significant time and resources.
The Buttigieg campaign’s success in fundraising and polling reflects a broader trend in the Democratic primary race. As the field narrows, candidates with strong fundraising and grassroots support are emerging as front-runners. This is in contrast to previous election cycles, where candidates with name recognition and support from party leaders often dominated the field.
Buttigieg’s campaign has also been successful in attracting a diverse range of supporters, including young people and voters of color. This has helped to distinguish him from some of the other candidates, who have struggled to attract a diverse base of supporters.
Despite his successes, Buttigieg faces significant challenges in the coming months. He will need to continue to build momentum and support in order to win the nomination. He will also need to contend with more established candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
The race for the Democratic nomination is far from over, and anything can happen between now and the convention. However, Buttigieg’s strong fundraising numbers and growing support suggest that he is a serious contender for the nomination. As the race continues to unfold, it will be interesting to see how Buttigieg and the other candidates adapt to the changing political landscape.
