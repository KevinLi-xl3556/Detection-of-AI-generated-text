As the world moves towards more autonomous vehicles, one of the most significant challenges that individuals will face is avoiding carsickness. This problem was insignificant in normal cars where humans had full control of the vehicle’s movements. But with self-driving cars, humans are no longer in control, and this may cause motion sickness for some passengers.
Motion sickness is a common problem that affects many individuals regularly. When in motion, the brain receives mixed signals from the visual sense and the inner ear’s balance sensors. This mixed information can cause discomfort and lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Unfortunately, self-driving cars may make this problem worse due to their unique and unfamiliar driving patterns.
However, there are several ways to avoid carsickness when in a self-driving car. The tips below can help individuals enjoy the benefits of automated driving without the discomfort of motion sickness.


Sit in the front seat - The front seat offers a better view of the road, providing more accurate visual cues. This helps to reduce the mixed signals between the visual sense and the inner ear’s balance sensors, reducing motion sickness.


Keep your eyes on the road - Keeping your eyes focused on the road helps to reduce the mixed signals in the brain. Avoid reading or using electronic devices while the car is in motion. Instead, engage in conversations with other passengers or enjoy the view outside.


Take breaks - If you start to feel unwell, it is essential to take a break. Ask the car to stop or pull over if necessary, get out of the car and take a few deep breaths. This helps to reduce motion sickness and improve your comfort level.


Avoid heavy meals before travel - Eating a heavy meal before the trip can cause stomach discomfort, making motion sickness worse. It is best to avoid a large meal and eat light snacks or meals in small portions throughout the journey.


Use medication - Over-the-counter medication such as anti-nausea or motion sickness pills can help alleviate motion sickness. Consult with a doctor to find the best medication for you.


In conclusion, self-driving cars are the future of transportation, bringing many benefits such as improved safety, convenience, and productivity. However, motion sickness could be a significant setback for some passengers. With the tips above, passengers can avoid carsickness and enjoy the benefits of autonomous vehicles.
