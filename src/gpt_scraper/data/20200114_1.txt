Lev Parnas Adds New Details on Push to Oust U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine
Lev Parnas, an associate of President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has added new details to the ongoing saga surrounding the push to oust the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Parnas, who has become a key player in the impeachment inquiry against Trump, recently sat down for an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and shared some new revelations about the campaign to remove Yovanovitch from her position in Kiev.
According to Parnas, the effort to remove Yovanovitch started as early as late 2018 and involved several individuals, including Giuliani and John Solomon, a journalist with ties to conservative media outlets. Parnas claims that Yovanovitch was seen as an obstacle to the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
Parnas alleges that Giuliani and his associates viewed Yovanovitch as disloyal to Trump and considered her to be part of the “deep state” conspiracy against the president. Parnas also claims that the involvement of Solomon was crucial to the operation, as he helped provide negative media coverage of Yovanovitch that helped to sway public opinion against her.
In the interview, Parnas also discussed his relationship with Ukrainian officials, including former prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko and current President Volodymyr Zelensky. Parnas claims that he was tasked with delivering messages from Giuliani to the Ukrainian government, including demands for investigations into the Bidens.
Parnas’ testimony adds to the mounting evidence that the push to remove Yovanovitch was part of a larger effort to leverage U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for political favors. The impeachment inquiry against Trump centers on allegations that he solicited Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid and a White House meeting.
Yovanovitch was recalled from her position as ambassador to Ukraine on May 20, 2019, following a smear campaign against her by Giuliani and his associates. Her testimony before Congress was seen as a crucial piece of evidence in the impeachment inquiry, as it shed light on the efforts to pressure Ukraine and the role played by Giuliani and his associates.
Parnas’ latest revelations are likely to add to the growing pressure on Trump and his administration, as the impeachment inquiry moves forward. Already, several high-ranking officials, including acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Advisor John Bolton, have been subpoenaed to testify before Congress. The White House has refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, but the mounting evidence against Trump is making it increasingly difficult for his defenders to maintain their position.
As the impeachment inquiry continues to unfold, the role played by Giuliani and his associates in the campaign to oust Yovanovitch is likely to become an even bigger focus. Parnas’ latest revelations are just the latest example of how his testimony has helped to shed light on the shadowy world of backroom deals and political machinations that are at the heart of this scandal.
