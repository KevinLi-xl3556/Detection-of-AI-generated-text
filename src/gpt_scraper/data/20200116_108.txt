The Russian parliament has approved President Vladimir Putin’s pick for prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, in a move that has been received with mixed reactions from both the public and the international community.
Mishustin, the former head of the Federal Tax Service, was nominated by Putin following the surprise resignation of former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and his Cabinet. The shakeup came after Putin proposed constitutional amendments that would broaden the powers of both the parliament and the State Council.
Despite being a relatively unknown figure, Mishustin quickly gained the support of 383 lawmakers in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. Only 41 parliamentarians opposed his nomination, marking a landslide victory for the new prime minister.
In his first address to parliament, Mishustin pledged to continue the work of his predecessor and focus on economic growth, social welfare, and the wellbeing of the Russian people. He also promised to crack down on corruption and implement new tax policies to boost the country’s revenue.
While some have hailed Mishustin’s appointment as a positive step for the Russian government, others have expressed concern about the lack of transparency in the selection process. Some opposition politicians have accused Putin of trying to consolidate his power by installing a loyal ally as prime minister.
Furthermore, some observers have noted that Mishustin’s background in tax collection could be a red flag for potential increases in taxes or greater tax collection efforts, which could hit taxpayers hard. However, those who support Mishustin’s appointment argue that his experience in managing taxes could lead to more efficient and transparent tax policies.
The appointment of Mishustin comes at a time when Russia is facing a number of domestic and international challenges, including growing social and economic inequality, strained relations with Western countries, and ongoing conflicts with neighboring countries in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.
It remains to be seen how Mishustin will address these challenges, and whether he will be able to build consensus and cooperation within the government and with opposition factions. Nevertheless, his appointment is a significant development in Russian politics and will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the future of the country.
