If you’re looking for a taste of Georgia, look no further than Chama Mama, a cozy restaurant in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood that specializes in traditional Georgian cuisine. Tucked away on West 17th Street, Chama Mama may not look like much from the outside, but the food inside is nothing short of exceptional.
One thing that sets Chama Mama apart from other restaurants is its commitment to serving Georgian rarities. While many Georgian restaurants in the United States focus on familiar dishes like khachapuri and shashlik, Chama Mama goes the extra mile to bring lesser-known Georgian delicacies to the table.
One standout example is the chikhirtma, a traditional Georgian soup made with chicken, egg yolks, and lemon juice that has been cooked down until it is thick and creamy. Chama Mama’s version is a true rarity, not often seen on menus even in Georgia itself. Order it and you’ll be rewarded with a bowl of silky, tangy soup that delights the taste buds and warms the soul.
Another must-try dish is the adjapsandali, a Georgian take on ratatouille made with roasted eggplant, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes. The vegetables are stewed together until they reach a state of tender perfection, then seasoned with traditional Georgian spices for an extra kick. Served with a side of fluffy, buttery mchadi (cornbread), it’s a meal that will leave you feeling satisfied and nourished.
Of course, Chama Mama also serves up tried-and-true Georgian classics like khinkali (dumplings) and pkhali (vegetable spreads), but it’s the rare and unusual dishes that really set this restaurant apart. And the best part? None of these dishes come with any fanfare or pretension. Chama Mama is all about letting the food speak for itself, and it does so beautifully.
If you’re a lover of Georgian cuisine (or just a lover of good food in general), Chama Mama is a must-visit spot in New York City. So next time you’re in the mood for something different, head to Chelsea and let the Georgian rarities at Chama Mama transport you to a world of flavor and delight.
