Kiley Reid Has Done Her Share of Soul-Searching in Coffee Shops
Kiley Reid is a young writer who has quickly made a name for herself with her debut novel, “Such a Fun Age.” The book, which was published in late 2019, has been a critical and commercial success, with reviewers praising Reid’s sharp writing and incisive social commentary.
But the road to success wasn’t easy for Reid. In fact, much of the work that went into “Such a Fun Age” was done in the quiet corners of coffee shops, where Reid spent countless hours wrestling with her ideas and trying to find her voice.
Reid, who grew up in Arizona and now lives in Philadelphia, began writing in earnest while working as a nanny in New York City. She would spend her days taking care of young children and her nights writing, often at the kitchen table after the kids had gone to bed.
As she honed her craft, Reid began to take her writing more seriously. She enrolled in an MFA program at the University of Iowa and spent two years there studying and writing. But even with the support of her professors and classmates, Reid found it difficult to make progress on her novel.
“I was struggling a lot with the book,” Reid said in an interview with The New York Times. “I would work on it for a while, then put it aside, then come back to it and realize it wasn’t working.”
It wasn’t until Reid moved to Philadelphia and started frequenting a local coffee shop that things began to click. The shop, which she calls her “office,” became a place where she could work through her ideas and find the rhythm of her writing.
“I think it’s just the act of physically leaving your house and going somewhere else to work,” Reid said. “It’s a small change, but it makes a big difference. And there’s something about being surrounded by other people who are also working that’s really motivating.”
Reid’s routine at the coffee shop was simple but effective. She would arrive early in the morning and order a coffee and a croissant, then settle in at a table with her laptop. She would write for a few hours, then take a break to read or people-watch. After lunch, she would return to her writing until it was time to go home.
The routine paid off. Reid finished her novel, and it was quickly picked up by her literary agent and then by her publisher. “Such a Fun Age” has since been translated into several languages and has been optioned for a television series.
But even with the success of her first book, Reid knows that writing is a lifelong pursuit. She still spends time at her local coffee shop, working on new projects and experimenting with new ideas.
“I think the most important thing for a writer is to be persistent,” Reid said. “You have to keep showing up, day after day, even when it’s hard. And sometimes, all it takes is a change of scenery and a good cup of coffee to get you there.”
