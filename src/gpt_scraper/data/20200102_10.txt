Which Subway Seat Is Best? Your Answer Is Obviously Wrong
When you ride a subway train, do you have a favorite seat? Perhaps you prefer the window seat to enjoy the view or the aisle seat to stretch your legs. Or maybe you avoid the seats near the door or the ones next to strangers. Whatever your preference, you might think that your choice is the best one. However, according to science, your answer could be wrong.
A recent study published in the journal Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications analyzed the movement of passengers in a crowded subway car and found that the optimal seat for each individual depends on various factors, such as the number of stops, the direction of the train, and the density of people. In other words, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the seat dilemma.
To understand the rationale behind this conclusion, let’s examine some of the common assumptions that people make about subway seats.

The Window Seat Is Better

Many subway riders prefer the window seat because it offers a view of the passing scenery, reduces claustrophobia or motion sickness, and provides a barrier against potential germs or harassment. However, the window seat can also be a trap if you need to exit quickly or if the train stops abruptly. Moreover, if the train is crowded, you might have to lean against the window or avoid eye contact with other passengers, which could make you feel exposed or isolated.

The Aisle Seat Is Better

On the other hand, some subway riders prefer the aisle seat because it allows easier access to the door or the platform, enables a quicker escape in case of emergency or discomfort, and offers more mobility or privacy. However, the aisle seat can also put you in the path of other passengers who want to pass or sit, as well as expose you to air drafts or noise from the door. Moreover, if you sit on the side of the aisle that coincides with the direction of the train, you might experience more motion sickness or annoyance from the sway or rumble of the carriages.

The Middle Seat Is Worse

Few subway riders willingly choose the middle seat, the one squeezed between two other seats, unless the train is relatively empty. Most people avoid the middle seat because it feels constrained, uncomfortable, or inconvenient. However, the middle seat could actually be the best option in some situations. For example, if you have a bulky item such as a backpack, shopping bag, or instrument, you could put it on the empty seat next to you and reduce the chance of bumping and spilling on other passengers. Also, if the train is full, the middle seat might offer more stability and balance than the two end seats, which could sway more due to the curves or turns of the track.

The Edge Seats Are Safer

Many subway riders believe that the seats next to the door or the end of the car are safer and easier to use. They think that sitting near the door allows them to get in and out more quickly, avoid getting trapped between other people, and have a better chance of finding a seat again if they have to transfer or change trains. However, sitting near the door also exposes them to more noise, wind, and disruption from the opening and closing of the door, as well as increases their risk of injury in case of a collision or derailment. Moreover, sitting near the end of the car might make them more vulnerable to theft or harassment from people who try to snatch their belongings or touch them.
Given these conflicting opinions and trade-offs, how can we determine the best subway seat? The answer is that we can’t. Or, more precisely, the best subway seat varies depending on the individual’s situation, preferences, and goals. Some factors that could influence the choice of seat include:

The distance of the stop you want to get off
The direction of the train (forward, backward, sideways)
The expected duration of the ride
The level of crowding in the car
The frequency of stops and transfers
The time of day and the type of passengers around you (e.g. tourists, commuters, students, seniors)
The activities you plan to do during the ride (e.g. reading, working, listening to music, sleeping)
The health condition and sensory sensitivity you have (e.g. vision impairment, hearing loss, allergy)

Therefore, next time you board a subway train, don’t assume that your answer to the seat question is the only right one. Instead, take a moment to assess your circumstances and choose the seat that suits your needs at that moment. If you want to be more adventurous, you could also experiment with different seats and see how they affect your experience. Who knows, you might discover a new favorite spot that you never considered before. Just be prepared to change it again the next time you ride.
