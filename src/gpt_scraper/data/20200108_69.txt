Robert Caro, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of biographies of Lyndon B. Johnson and Robert Moses, has announced that he will be donating his papers to the New-York Historical Society.
Caro is one of the most celebrated biographers of our time, known for his meticulous research and masterful storytelling. His biographies of Johnson and Moses are considered among the greatest works of American history, and have earned him numerous awards and accolades.
The donation of his papers will provide scholars and researchers with an unprecedented glimpse into the mind of one of America’s greatest historians. According to the New-York Historical Society, the collection includes “notes, drafts, outlines, and research materials for Caro’s books, as well as his interviews, correspondence, and speeches, and other materials that have never been made public.”
Caro said in a statement that he chose the New-York Historical Society because he believes they are “the perfect place” for his papers. “They share my commitment to the importance of understanding the past, and they have the resources and expertise to ensure that my research is preserved for future generations,” he said.
Louise Mirrer, the president and CEO of the New-York Historical Society, praised the donation, saying that Caro’s work has “deepened our understanding of the people and events that have shaped our country.” She added that the collection would be “a vital resource for generations of scholars and researchers to come.”
The donation of Caro’s papers is a significant moment for both the New-York Historical Society and the wider community of historians and researchers. It demonstrates the importance of preserving the records of our greatest thinkers and storytellers, and it underscores the crucial role that institutions like the New-York Historical Society play in advancing our understanding of the world around us.
As Caro himself put it in his statement, “History isn’t just about what happened in the past. It’s about how we understand ourselves in the present, and how we shape the future. I’m thrilled that my papers will be part of that ongoing conversation.”
