On September 23rd, 2019, Steph Korey, the CEO of popular luggage brand, Away, stepped down from her position amidst a wave of criticism over her management style. However, just weeks after her resignation, Korey has returned to the company as the co-CEO alongside co-founder, Jen Rubio.
Korey’s resignation followed an article in The Verge that exposed a toxic company culture at Away, including Korey’s alleged abusive behavior towards employees. In the wake of the article, Korey issued an apology and announced her resignation.
The decision to bring Korey back as co-CEO has generated mixed reactions among consumers and former employees. While some believe in her leadership abilities, others fear that her return signals a lack of accountability for her past actions.
In a statement, Rubio defended the decision, saying, “Steph and I have always shared the same vision for Away, and her expertise and experience will be invaluable to the company moving forward. We’re committed to creating a positive and supportive culture for our employees and delivering the best possible products to our customers.”
Since her departure, Away has implemented several changes to improve its workplace environment. The company hired a new head of HR and launched an anonymous feedback platform for employees to address any concerns. Additionally, Away has donated $125,000 to an organization dedicated to supporting mental health in the workplace.
Despite these efforts, some former employees have spoken out against Korey’s return, citing concerns over the company’s commitment to change. In response, Korey has pledged to work towards a more inclusive and supportive work culture at Away.
As Away moves forward with Korey in a co-CEO role, the company faces a critical juncture. It must reconcile its past mistakes while charting a sustainable course for growth and innovation. Only time will tell if the company can successfully navigate these challenges and emerge stronger on the other side.
