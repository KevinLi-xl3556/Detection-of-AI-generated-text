On Tuesday, May 18th, a chemical plant explosion in the northern Spanish city of Avilés killed one person and prompted authorities to issue an order for residents to stay indoors.
The incident occurred at around 11:00 AM local time at a chemical plant owned by the company IQOXE, which produces ethylene oxide, a highly flammable and explosive substance used in the production of solvents, antifreeze, and detergents. A tank containing the substance exploded, causing a massive fire that took several hours to put out.
The explosion caused significant damage to the surrounding area, shattering windows and causing roofs to collapse. The victim of the explosion was a man who lived near the plant and was hit by falling debris.
Following the explosion, authorities issued an order for residents within a one-mile radius of the plant to stay inside with doors and windows closed. The order was lifted several hours later, after firefighters had managed to contain the blaze and ensure that there was no risk of further explosions.
IQOXE has said that it is cooperating fully with the investigation into the cause of the explosion, and has expressed its condolences to the family of the deceased.
The incident is not the first time that an IQOXE plant has experienced an explosion. In January of 2020, a similar accident occurred at the company’s plant in Tarragona, killing three people and injuring several others. The cause of that explosion was also a tank of ethylene oxide.
The incidents have raised questions about the safety of chemical plants and the protocols in place to prevent accidents. Some residents of Avilés have criticized the company and the authorities for not taking adequate safety measures, and have called for tighter regulations on chemical plants.
The government of Spain has promised to investigate the incident thoroughly and to work to prevent similar accidents in the future. In the meantime, the people of Avilés and the surrounding areas will be left to mourn the loss of the one person who lost their life in the explosion, and to reflect on the potential dangers that exist in their community.
