In China, the Communist Party has long sought to cement its rule by instilling a sense of national pride and loyalty to the party among the country’s citizens. One way the party has tried to achieve this goal is by promoting the idea of “red tourism,” which involves visits to sites of historical and cultural significance to the Communist Party. One such site is the “sacred” lake of Hongjiannao in Inner Mongolia, where Chinese citizens have been flocking in droves to declare their love for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party.
The lake, which covers an area of over 60 square kilometers, has been a site of pilgrimage for many years, with visitors coming to see its crystal-clear waters and beautiful surroundings. But in recent years, the lake has taken on a new significance, becoming a symbol of the party’s power and the love that Chinese citizens are expected to have for their leaders.
Visitors to Hongjiannao are greeted by propaganda banners and signs extolling the virtues of President Xi and the Communist Party. The lake’s surroundings are also adorned with statues of revolutionary heroes and other symbols of Communist Party history. For many Chinese citizens, the lake has become a must-visit destination, a place where they can publicly express their support for the party and its leadership.
One visitor to the lake, a woman in her 50s, told reporters that she had come to Hongjiannao to “show my love for our country and our leader.” She added that “we are lucky to have such a great leader who cares about the people and is leading our country to a better future.”
But not everyone is convinced by the party’s propaganda. Some critics have accused the Communist Party of using Hongjiannao and other sites of red tourism to manipulate public opinion and suppress dissent. They argue that the party’s emphasis on national pride and loyalty to the party is a means of diverting attention away from the country’s many problems, including corruption, economic inequality, and human rights abuses.
Despite these criticisms, the party’s efforts to promote red tourism and instill loyalty to its leaders have been largely successful. Chinese citizens are increasingly identifying with the party’s message of national pride and loyalty, and are expressing their support in ever more vocal and public ways.
For the Communist Party, Hongjiannao and other sites of red tourism represent a powerful tool for maintaining its grip on power and promoting its message of national pride and loyalty. But for many Chinese citizens, these sites are a place to celebrate their love for their country and its leaders, and to express their hopes for a brighter future.
