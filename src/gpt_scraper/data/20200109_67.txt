The Oscars, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the film industry, has been a tradition showcasing the best of Hollywood since 1927. For decades, the event became as much about who would host as who would win. Unfortunately, for the 2020 Oscars, there won’t be a host, marking the second consecutive year without one.
In previous years, the Academy has selected popular comedians, actors or actresses to act as the host and entertain the audience. For example, in 2019, the Academy initially asked Kevin Hart, a popular comedian and actor, to host the show. However, he was forced to step down after a series of old homophobic tweets resurfaced. The search for a new host was on, yet, after much discussion, the Academy decided not to have one.
Many were skeptical about how the Oscars would function without a host, and yet the 2019 event ran smoothly without serious glitches or awkward exchanges. The show was instead opened by Queen and Adam Lambert in a performance that electrified the audience. The rest of the event was filled with breathtaking musical performances and stand-up comedy segments by various celebrities.
The decision has been somewhat of a revelation; the event became more focused on the art of film-making and the achievements of the talented nominees. Without a host, the connection between the audience and the nominees was emphasized, as they were given more time to speak about their experiences and thank those who helped them on their artistic journey.
It is not uncommon for the Oscars to face controversy or changes. Back in the 1960s, the ceremony moved from a dinner-party style event to a more formal format. Over the years, the introduction of new categories and the possibility of expanding Best Picture nominee numbers were all subject to debate. However, the absence of a host for the second year in a row has brought with it a positive change that better aligns the awards ceremony with the award’s true purpose.
In conclusion, despite skepticism initially surrounding the choice, the Oscars have been able to create an appealing show that prioritizes the nominees and their achievements, and rightly so. The decision to ditch the tradition of having a host has not only heightened the celebratory ambiance for those nominated, but created a fresh and exciting viewing experience for those watching from home. With the recent pandemic, the event had to make other adjustments, including hosting at Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. It will mark a new era marked by innovation and adaptation, with or without a host.
