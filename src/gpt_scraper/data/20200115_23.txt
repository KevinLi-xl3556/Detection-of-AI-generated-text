The 2020 Democratic Presidential race has officially kicked off with the first Democratic debate held in Iowa on January 14th, 2020. With the Iowa caucuses fast approaching on February 3rd, this debate was crucial for the candidates to make a strong impression on voters and differentiate themselves from their rivals.
According to Nielsen ratings, the debate drew in 7.3 million viewers across multiple channels, making it the most-watched Democratic primary debate ever. The previous record was held by the October 2015 debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, which drew in 15.8 million viewers.
The Iowa debate featured six candidates on stage: former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, and businessman Tom Steyer. The candidates discussed a range of issues including healthcare, climate change, foreign policy, and gun control.
One of the standout moments of the debate was when Warren and Sanders were caught on a hot mic having a tense exchange after the debate. Warren had accused Sanders of telling her that a woman couldnâ€™t win the presidency, which Sanders denied. The incident sparked a heated debate in the media and among voters, with some calling for more civility and others calling for transparency and honesty.
Overall, the debate was seen as a success for Warren, who was praised for her detailed policy proposals and commanding presence on stage. Buttigieg also received positive reviews for his eloquence and ability to connect with voters. Biden, on the other hand, faced criticism for his gaffes and lack of energy on stage, while Klobuchar and Steyer struggled to stand out among the more established candidates.
As the Iowa caucuses approach, the candidates will continue to make their case to voters in the state and across the country. With the Democratic field still crowded and no clear front-runner, every debate and campaign event is crucial for the candidates to make a lasting impression and gain support.
The next Democratic debate is scheduled for February 7th, just days after the Iowa caucuses. With the stakes high and the competition fierce, the race for the Democratic nomination is sure to be one of the most exciting and closely watched political contests in recent memory.
