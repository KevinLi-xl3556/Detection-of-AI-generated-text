A recent book has unveiled the alleged attempts made by former US President Donald Trump to eradicate the Anti-Bribery Rule, which he regarded as an unfair regulation. The claims were disclosed in a new book by investigative journalist David Cay Johnston, who portrays Donald Trump’s years in office in a negative light. The book, titled “The Big Cheat: How Donald Trump Fleece America and Enriched Himself and His Family,” delves into detailed accounts of alleged misconduct by the former President.
According to the book, Donald Trump had allegedly sought ways to abolish the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) during his tenure as President. The FCPA is a federal law that imposes strict penalties on businesses engaged in bribery and corruption of foreign officials. The law also requires all publicly traded companies to maintain accurate accounting records as a measure to prevent corruption.
Johnston stated that Trump had criticized the FCPA, claiming that it hindered American businesses abroad while allowing foreign companies to engage in corrupt practices unpunished. The former President allegedly considered the regulation unfair because it placed too many restrictions on companies wanting to do business overseas, resulting in fewer opportunities for American companies to expand.
The allegations by Johnston are no minor issue. They raise questions about the integrity of the Trump administration and its stance against corruption. Trump had promised to tackle corruption during his term, yet he now stands accused of seeking to weaken the very laws that prevent corruption and bribery.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is considered a powerful tool to curb corruption around the world. It has been implemented for over four decades, and major corporations have become accountable under its scrutiny. Any efforts to diminish the law would have a severe impact on the global fight against corruption.
In recent years, many corporations have been held accountable under the FCPA for their corrupt practices. This has resulted in large fines and significant damage to business reputations. Had Trump succeeded in his attempts to abolish the law, consequences for the economy and the global fight against corruption could have been dire.
In conclusion, David Cay Johnston’s book sheds light on alleged attempts by former President Donald Trump to weaken the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which he regarded as unfair. The allegations raise concerns about the integrity of the Trump administration, particularly regarding its stance on corruption. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been instrumental in promoting accountability and transparency in the international business community. Any attempts to weaken it could jeopardize the global fight against corruption.
