In a Crowded New York City, Should Newcomers ‘Go Back to Iowa’?
New York City is known as the city of dreams. It is where people from all over the world come to live, work and fulfil their aspirations. However, with its massive population and sky-high prices, some New Yorkers are staring to ask if newcomers should go back to where they came from. One of the increasingly common statements is “Go back to Iowa!” But is this line of thinking fair, and does it hold any weight?
On the one hand, it is easy to see why some people might feel that way. New Yorkers are notoriously territorial and proud of their city, and they may feel that outsiders don’t belong there. Some might argue that the city’s population is already too high, and that newcomers are only adding to the problem. From this perspective, urging newcomers to return to their hometowns might seem like the logical solution.
However, this type of thinking is misguided and flawed. Firstly, it ignores the fact that New York City has always been a city of newcomers. Whether people are moving from Iowa, California or further afield, they all bring new ideas, perspectives and energy to the city. This mix of cultures and communities is what makes New York City so dynamic and exciting.
Secondly, it is deeply unfair to tell people to return to where they came from. The vast majority of newcomers to New York City are hard-working, ambitious people who only want to build a better life for themselves and their families. To tell them to leave the city they have chosen as their home is not only insensitive but also goes against the values that America was founded on.
Moreover, New York City has always been a place of opportunity. People flock there from across the US to pursue their dreams, and to the exclusion is contrary to the city’s spirit. Forcing newcomers to leave will do nothing to address the very real issues of overcrowding, housing price hikes and inequality that the city faces.
It’s time for longtime New Yorkers to welcome newcomers with open arms and work together to create a better future for everyone. Instead of telling people to leave, we should be working to improve the city’s infrastructure, create jobs, promoting education, climate change action, affordable housing and a healthy environment for every NYC resident.
In conclusion, the statement “Go back to Iowa!” is a misguided and shortsighted attitude towards newcomers in New York City. Not only does it go against the principles of inclusivity, but it also ignores the fact that newcomers have always been a vital part of the city’s success. Instead of pushing them away, we should embrace them and work towards making New York City a better place for all.
