Title: Carlos Ghosn Skipped Bail. This Man Was Left Behind.
Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan and Renault, made headlines in 2018 when he was arrested in Japan on charges of financial misconduct. He was released on bail but then fled the country in a daring escape that involved hiding in a box used for audio equipment.
While the world was fixated on Ghosn’s escape, another man was left behind. This man was Greg Kelly, an American executive who had worked alongside Ghosn at Nissan for years.
Kelly was arrested along with Ghosn in 2018 and faced similar charges of financial misconduct. However, unlike Ghosn, Kelly did not have the option to flee the country. He was released on bail and remained in Japan, awaiting trial.
Kelly maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal, insisting that he had not committed any wrongdoing. However, his legal battle dragged on for years, taking a toll on his health and personal life.
Meanwhile, Ghosn’s escape only added insult to injury for Kelly. Not only was he left to face the consequences of their shared alleged wrongdoing, but he also had to deal with the fallout from Ghosn’s dramatic escape.
The media frenzy surrounding Ghosn’s story overshadowed Kelly’s plight, as he struggled to fight his case in a foreign legal system. He was eventually acquitted in September 2020, but the damage had already been done.
The case of Carlos Ghosn and Greg Kelly highlights the inequality that can exist in the justice system. While Ghosn was able to use his wealth and resources to flee justice, Kelly was left behind to face the consequences.
The media should take note of this and ensure that every person involved in a case is given equal attention, regardless of their status or situation. Justice should be blind to one’s position and should be equal for all.
In conclusion, Greg Kelly’s story serves as a reminder of the collateral damage that can be caused by high-profile cases. As we continue to follow the story of Carlos Ghosn and his escape from justice, we must also remember the man who was left behind.
