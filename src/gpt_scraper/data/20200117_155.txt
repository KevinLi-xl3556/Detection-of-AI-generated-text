Tyler Perry’s latest film, “A Fall From Grace,” is a trope-filled thriller that will leave audiences questioning its supposed twists and turns. The movie focuses on the fall from grace of Grace Waters, an older woman who is accused of murdering her husband. But behind the investigation and trial lies a web of deceit that goes beyond the murder.
The movie stars Crystal Fox in the role of Grace, a middle-aged divorcee who meets a charming and handsome younger man named Shannon (Mehcad Brooks) at a diner. They quickly fall in love, and Grace marries him without much consideration for his past life. However, after some tumultuous events, Grace finds herself in jail, with her fate hinging on the skills of her lawyer, Jasmine (Bresha Webb).
The movie aims to be a thriller filled with twists and turns, but it feels more like a list of common tropes seen in other dramas of this genre. There are the seemingly perfect couple that isn’t what it seems, the sassy best friend, the corrupt police force framing a suspect, and the ultimate twist that isn’t terribly surprising.
One of the problems with the movie is its pacing. The first half of the movie feels sluggish and slow, with much of the action happening off-screen. The second half is where the movie picks up speed, but it is too little too late. The character development is thin, which makes it difficult for the audience to care about the fate of the characters.
Crystal Fox’s portrayal of Grace is one of the few bright spots in the movie. She manages to capture the nuances of a woman who has lost everything and is trying to regain control of her life. Her chemistry with Mehcad Brooks is enjoyable to watch, but their relationship is not given enough screen time to really develop.
In conclusion, “A Fall From Grace” is a trope-filled thriller that fails to deliver a suspenseful and engaging story. While there are some shining moments, they are overshadowed by the drag of the movie’s pacing and predictable twists. Tyler Perry has shown that he has the potential to create engaging and thought-provoking films, but this one falls short of the mark. It’s a disappointing addition to his body of work.
