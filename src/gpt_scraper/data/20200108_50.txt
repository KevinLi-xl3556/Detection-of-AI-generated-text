In the 1990s, Elizabeth Wurtzel was the voice of a generation. Her memoir, “Prozac Nation,” chronicled her battle with depression and addiction and resonated with many young people who were also struggling to find their place in the world. But in the years that followed, Wurtzel’s behavior became increasingly erratic, and she seemed to be stuck in a perpetual state of adolescence. Now, however, it appears that Wurtzel has finally grown up, like the rest of her generation.
Wurtzel, who passed away in 2020, was born in 1967 and came of age in the 1980s and 1990s. This was a time of great social and cultural upheaval, as Generation X came of age in the shadow of the Baby Boomers. Like many of her peers, Wurtzel was drawn to the counter-culture of the time, experimenting with drugs and challenging societal norms.
In “Prozac Nation,” Wurtzel chronicled her struggles with depression and addiction, which were common themes among her generation. But while her writing was raw and honest, it also had a certain self-indulgence to it. Wurtzel seemed to revel in her own misery, and her behavior off the page was often just as self-destructive as the behavior she described in her book.
This continued into the 2000s, as Wurtzel’s personal life became increasingly chaotic. She wrote about her experiences with drugs, sex, and relationships in various essays and books, but her work was often criticized for being narcissistic and lacking in self-awareness.
However, in the last years of her life, Wurtzel seemed to have finally grown up. She began to take responsibility for her actions, and to acknowledge the impact that her behavior had on others. In an essay for The Guardian in 2015, Wurtzel wrote about the importance of forgiveness, both for herself and for others. She also acknowledged that she had been “a difficult person to deal with” in the past, and that she was working to change that.
Wurtzel’s shift in attitude was not unique. Many members of Generation X have also gone through a similar transformation as they have entered middle age. As the responsibilities of adulthood set in, many have come to see the world in a different light, and to prioritize relationships and personal growth over self-indulgence and rebellion.
This shift has been particularly pronounced in recent years, as the world has become more uncertain and unstable. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people to confront their own mortality and to re-evaluate their priorities. In this context, the kind of nihilistic self-indulgence that characterized much of Generation X’s youth seems increasingly out of place.
In conclusion, Elizabeth Wurtzel was a representative of a generation that was defined by its struggles with depression, addiction, and self-destructive behavior. But in the last years of her life, she seemed to have finally grown up and taken responsibility for her actions. This shift is part of a broader trend among members of Generation X, as they enter middle age and prioritize personal growth and relationships over rebellion and self-indulgence. Ultimately, this shift represents a maturation of the generation that once seemed determined to never grow up.
