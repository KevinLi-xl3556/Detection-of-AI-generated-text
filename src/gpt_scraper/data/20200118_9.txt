On January 15, 2009, Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger was piloting a US Airways flight that struck a flock of geese shortly after takeoff, causing both engines to fail. With no time to spare, Sullenberger made the split-second decision to land the plane on the Hudson River rather than risk crashing into the densely populated streets of New York City. All 155 passengers and crew on board survived, and Sullenberger became an instant hero.
But what most people don’t know is that Sullenberger, like President Joe Biden, once struggled with a speech impediment. As a child, he struggled with stuttering and was often teased and bullied because of it. In a recent interview with The Atlantic, Sullenberger spoke candidly about his experiences with stuttering and the impact it has had on his life.
“I was teased, I was bullied, I was isolated. I grew up feeling like a burden,” Sullenberger said. “But what saved me was that I had a few people in my life who saw something in me that I didn’t even see in myself.”
Sullenberger credits his mother, a teacher, with helping him overcome his stutter. She would often read to him and encourage him to try speaking in different voices and accents, which helped him learn to control his speech muscles.
But even after he overcame his stutter, Sullenberger still struggled with anxiety and self-doubt. He recalled a particularly difficult moment when he was asked to read a passage aloud in front of his entire high school English class.
“My worst fear came true: I stuttered,” Sullenberger said. “Everyone laughed. I was mortified.”
Despite this setback, Sullenberger eventually went on to pursue a career in aviation and became a highly respected pilot. But the memories of his struggles with stuttering and the fear of being mocked or ridiculed never completely went away.
“I still worry about it,” Sullenberger admitted. “I still have moments of anxiety, especially when I’m under stress or fatigue.”
But he also recognizes the power of his story and hopes that by speaking out about his own experiences, he can help others who may be struggling with similar challenges.
“I dare anyone to mock me,” Sullenberger said. “I’ve already faced my worst fears and come out on the other side. Nothing anyone can say could hurt me more than the pain I’ve already been through.”
Sullenberger’s story is a powerful reminder that even the most successful and accomplished people can face challenges and setbacks in their lives. But with perseverance, determination, and the support of others, we can overcome these obstacles and achieve our goals.
