Conor McGregor, the Irish professional mixed martial artist, is undoubtedly one of the most popular and controversial figures in the world of combat sports. Known for his quick wit, cocky attitude, and flashy fighting style, McGregor has captured the attention of fight fans all over the world.
Despite his recent retirement announcements, fighters of all kinds still have their sights set on McGregor. From boxers to mixed martial artists, everyone wants a piece of “The Notorious.”
One of the most notable fighters who has called out McGregor is boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. The two fighters faced off in what was dubbed “The Money Fight” in 2017, which saw Mayweather emerge victorious after a 10th-round TKO. However, since that fight, rumors of a potential rematch between the two have circulated.
Another boxer who has expressed interest in fighting McGregor is Manny Pacquiao. The Filipino boxer and politician even went as far as to tweet out a poll asking his followers who they would like to see him fight next, with McGregor being one of the listed options.
In the world of mixed martial arts, there are no shortage of fighters who would love to face off against McGregor. One of the most notable is Khabib Nurmagomedov, the undefeated Russian fighter who defeated McGregor in a highly publicized bout in 2018. Despite since retiring from the sport, Nurmagomedov has repeatedly stated that he would be willing to come out of retirement for a rematch with McGregor.
Other MMA fighters who have expressed interest in fighting McGregor include Tony Ferguson, Justin Gaethje, and Nate Diaz.
Even professional boxers who have never competed in MMA are getting in on the action. Former world champion boxer Paulie Malignaggi has called out McGregor, claiming that he would be willing to step into the octagon to face him.
So why is everyone so eager to fight McGregor? For starters, the Irishman’s brash personality and public antics have made him one of the most polarizing figures in combat sports. But beyond that, his popularity has made him a lucrative opponent for anyone who steps into the ring or octagon with him.
Despite his recent retirements and legal troubles, it seems that McGregor’s star power is not waning anytime soon. And as long as that star power remains, there will be no shortage of fighters who want to take their shot against “The Notorious.”
