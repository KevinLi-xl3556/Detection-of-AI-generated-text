The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has announced its nominations for the best screenplays of 2019, and the list is a testament to the exceptional writing talent that was on display in the year’s most critically acclaimed films. Among the nominees are the Korean-language thriller “Parasite,” the heart-wrenching family drama “Marriage Story,” and the darkly comic supervillain origin story “Joker.”
“Parasite,” written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won, tells the story of a poor family that infiltrates the household of a wealthy family by posing as skilled workers. The film won the Palme d’Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and has been widely hailed as one of the best films of the year. Its nomination for the WGA award is a well-deserved recognition of its masterful screenplay, which deftly blends elements of comedy, drama, and suspense.
“Marriage Story,” written by director Noah Baumbach, follows a couple going through a painful divorce and the impact it has on their young son. The film has been praised for its honest and empathetic portrayal of the complexities of marriage and divorce, and for its nuanced character development. Baumbach’s nomination for the WGA award is his second, following his nomination for “The Squid and the Whale” in 2006.
“Joker,” written by director Todd Phillips and Scott Silver, is a gritty and violent exploration of the origins of one of the most iconic supervillains in comic book history. The film has been praised for its powerful performances and its commentary on issues of mental health and social inequality. Its nomination for the WGA award is a recognition of its bold and ambitious screenplay, which pushes the boundaries of what a comic book movie can be.
Other nominees for the WGA award for best original screenplay include “Knives Out,” written by Rian Johnson, “Booksmart,” written by Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel, and Katie Silberman, and “1917,” written by Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns. The nominees for best adapted screenplay include “The Irishman,” written by Steven Zaillian, “Little Women,” written by Greta Gerwig, “Jojo Rabbit,” written by Taika Waititi, and “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster.
