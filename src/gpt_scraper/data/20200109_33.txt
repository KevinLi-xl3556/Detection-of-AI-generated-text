On a seemingly ordinary day in January 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced their intention to step back from their royal duties and pursue a life outside of the British monarchy. The news sent shockwaves through the royal family and the world at large, as the couple’s decision to go rogue caught the palace off guard.
The announcement, made on the Sussexes’ official Instagram account, stated that the couple intended to “carve out a progressive new role” within the royal family and become financially independent. The statement also revealed that the couple planned to split their time between the United Kingdom and North America.
While it had been rumored that Harry and Meghan were unhappy with their roles in the royal family, the announcement still came as a surprise to many. The palace had not been consulted before the couple made their statement, and senior members of the royal family were said to be “hurt” by the news.
The decision to step back from royal duties was seen as a bold move by the couple, and it quickly became clear that they were determined to do things their own way. In the months that followed, Harry and Meghan embarked on a series of high-profile initiatives, including launching their own charitable foundation and signing a multi-year deal with Netflix to produce documentaries, feature films, and children’s programming.
The couple’s decision to go rogue was met with mixed reactions from the public. While many praised Harry and Meghan for charting their own path and putting their own happiness first, others criticized the couple for abandoning their duties and responsibilities as members of the royal family.
The controversy surrounding the couple’s decision was only heightened by the fact that they chose to speak out about their experiences in the royal family. In an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired in March 2021, Harry and Meghan made a series of explosive allegations about their treatment at the hands of the royal family, including claims of racism and a lack of support for Meghan’s mental health struggles.
The interview sent shockwaves through the royal family and the world at large, and it reignited debates about the role of the monarchy in modern society. While some defended the royal family and criticized Harry and Meghan for airing their grievances in public, others praised the couple for speaking out and shining a light on the issues of racism and mental health.
As the dust settles on Harry and Meghan’s decision to go rogue, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the couple and the royal family. While the couple has made it clear that they intend to continue living their lives on their own terms, the palace has also made it clear that they expect Harry and Meghan to fulfill their royal duties and responsibilities.
Only time will tell how this saga will play out, but one thing is certain: the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan to go rogue caught the palace off guard and set in motion a chain of events that has forever changed the royal family.
