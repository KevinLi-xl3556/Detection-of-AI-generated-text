Tom Railsback, a former Congressman who played a significant role in ousting President Nixon during the historic Watergate scandal, passed away on January 20, 2020. He was 87 years old.
Railsback, a Republican from Illinois, was often considered a moderate during his time in Congress from 1967 to 1983. But it was his pivotal role in the Watergate scandal that cemented his legacy in American political history. Railsback was one of only a handful of Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching Nixon in 1974, helping to build the bipartisan coalition that ultimately forced the president to resign.
Railsback’s path to impeachment began in 1973, when he was a member of the House Judiciary Committee. As the panel began investigating Watergate – the break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., in 1972 that ultimately led to Nixon’s downfall – Railsback initially expressed skepticism about the allegations. But as the evidence mounted and the White House stonewalled the committee’s requests for information, Railsback began to see that Nixon had likely been involved in a cover-up.
In July 1974, Railsback and five other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee broke with their party and voted in favor of three articles of impeachment against Nixon, including obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The vote helped to convince Nixon that he could no longer survive in office, and he announced his resignation just weeks later.
Railsback’s vote was controversial at the time, and he received a great deal of criticism from his fellow Republicans for his role in the impeachment process. But he remained steadfast in his belief that it was the right thing to do.
“I felt that my job as a member of the Judiciary Committee during that critical time was to try to establish the truth and report to the American people what we found,” he said in an interview with the Illinois News Network in 2014. “I felt that the information that we had developed, through the evidence and the testimony, was credible and convincing.”
Railsback’s decision to vote for impeachment had a lasting impact on the Republican Party as well. In the years that followed, the party gradually began to move away from the hardline conservatism that had defined it in the past, and started to embrace a more moderate, centrist approach to politics.
Despite his historic role in the Watergate scandal, Railsback remained a humble and down-to-earth public servant throughout his life. After leaving Congress, he returned to his hometown of Moline, Illinois, where he continued to serve his community in a variety of ways.
His passing marks the end of an era in American history, but his legacy as a principled and courageous lawmaker will live on for many years to come.
