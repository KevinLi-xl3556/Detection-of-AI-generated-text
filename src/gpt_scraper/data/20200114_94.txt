Democratic Debate, Apple, L.S.U.: Your Tuesday Briefing
Good morning readers,
Here are the top stories for your Tuesday briefing.
Democratic Debate:
The United States continues to embark on its political journey as the presidential primary season heats up. The latest democratic debate which was held last night in Charleston, South Carolina, became a heated exchange between Senator Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. The candidates largely focused on each other’s policy positions and movements in the polls, with moderators pressing the candidates on the hot topics of gun violence, race relations and climate change. In the end, the debate was long on drama and energy, but short on specifics.
Apple:
Yesterday, Apple unveiled a new version of its popular iPad Pro, featuring a new camera configuration, faster performance, and a new microphone array. In addition, the technology giant also launched a new keyboard with a built-in trackpad for the iPad, which is expected to compete directly with Microsoft’s Surface. This surprise announcement comes as Apple works to expand its tablet market share, while also jumping into the hybrid laptop market.
L.S.U:
The Louisiana State University Tigers basketball program is under investigation after the release of a wire-tap recording, revealing that the acting head coach, Tony Benford, paid a player’s father $300,000. This type of payment is a violation of NCAA rules and could lead to serious consequences for the Tigers program, including the voiding of their 2019-20 season, wherein they currently hold a $21-10 record. It remains to be seen how this investigation will impact the team moving forward.
That’s all for today’s briefing. Stay tuned for further updates on these and other stories.
Have a great day!
