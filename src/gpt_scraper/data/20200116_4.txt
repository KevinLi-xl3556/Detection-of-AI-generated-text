Apple’s highly anticipated movie, “The Banker,” which was initially set to release in 2019, was delayed due to allegations of sexual abuse against the son of the real-life protagonist. However, the tech giant recently announced that the film will now be released on December 6, 2019, exclusively through Apple TV+.
“The Banker” tells the story of two African American entrepreneurs, Bernard Garrett (played by Anthony Mackie) and Joe Morris (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who team up to challenge the racial and economic prejudices of the 1960s. The film is directed by George Nolfi and written by Niceole Levy, David Lewis Smith, Stan Younger, and Brad Kane.
The movie’s delay came amid allegations of sexual abuse against Bernard Garrett Jr., the son of Garrett, who is also a co-producer on the film. Two of Garrett’s half-sisters accused him of sexual abuse, prompting Apple to halt the film’s release and investigate the allegations.
However, after conducting an internal investigation, Apple found the allegations to be unsubstantiated, and the company decided to move forward with the film’s release. In a statement, Apple said, “We stand by the film, and its filmmakers, as well as the actors who brought this important story to life.”
The delay of “The Banker” highlights the growing concerns around the #MeToo movement and the impact it’s having on the entertainment industry. Many studios and distributors are reevaluating their policies around allegations of sexual abuse, and some are opting to delay or even scrap projects altogether. However, Apple’s decision to move forward with the film sends a message that they stand by their commitment to deliver compelling content while also taking allegations of abuse seriously.
This film also shines a spotlight on the challenges that African Americans faced in the 1960s when trying to break into the world of banking. The story’s themes of resilience, determination, and overcoming adversity are relevant today, and it’s important that these narratives continue to be told. “The Banker” marks a significant moment in the film industry and a step forward for diversity and representation.
In addition to Mackie and Jackson, “The Banker” also stars Nicholas Hoult, Nia Long, and Colm Meaney. The film had its world premiere at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles on November 21, 2019, receiving positive reviews from critics. With a new release date set, fans can look forward to finally watching “The Banker” and discovering the inspiring story of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris.
