As the world continues to discuss the fallout from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey, many Black Britons are wondering what took the couple so long to speak out about their experiences with racism within the royal family.
For many people of color in Britain, Harry and Meghan’s interview was a long-awaited moment of validation, as they spoke candidly about the racist attitudes they faced from within the monarchy. From concerns about the color of their child’s skin to the lack of support when Meghan was experiencing mental health struggles, the couple’s revelations painted a damning picture of the royal family’s treatment of people of color.
However, for some Black Britons, the interview was also a source of frustration. After all, racism within the royal family is nothing new – and many people of color in Britain have been speaking out about it for years. From the constant media scrutiny and racist abuse directed at Meghan to the persistent lack of diversity in the monarchy, Black Britons have been well aware of the systemic issues facing people of color in the country’s highest echelons of power.
So, the question remains: what took Harry and Meghan so long to speak out? Some have speculated that the couple may have been worried about the repercussions of speaking out against the royal family. After all, the monarchy wields immense power and influence in Britain – and speaking out against it could have serious consequences.
Others have suggested that the couple may have been trying to protect their position within the royal family, and that speaking out could have jeopardized their access to certain privileges and opportunities. Indeed, Meghan hinted at this during the interview, saying that there were “conversations” about her son not being given a royal title and that there were concerns about how dark his skin would be.
Regardless of the reasons behind Harry and Meghan’s decision to speak out, the interview has sparked an important conversation about racism in Britain – and particularly within the country’s highest levels of power. Black Britons are now calling for real change, both within the royal family and in broader society.
Some have called for the monarchy to publicly address the allegations made by Harry and Meghan, and to take concrete steps to address systemic racism within its ranks. Others have called for more diversity and representation in positions of power across the country, including in politics, business, and the media.
Ultimately, the conversation sparked by Harry and Meghan’s interview is an important one – and it’s long overdue. For too long, people of color in Britain have been marginalized and excluded from positions of power and influence. Now, thanks to the bravery of Harry and Meghan, those voices are finally being heard.
