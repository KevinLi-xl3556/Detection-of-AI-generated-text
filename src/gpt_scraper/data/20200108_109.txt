Hologram Musicians: A New Frontier in the Music Industry
The music industry has seen its fair share of technological advancements over the years, from vinyl records to streaming services. However, the latest trend is taking things to a whole new level: hologram musicians.
Hologram concerts, where a virtual performer is projected onto a stage, have been around for a few years now. The technology has been used to bring back deceased artists such as Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson, and Roy Orbison. But in recent years, companies have been exploring the potential of creating entirely new hologram performers.
One of the most notable examples is the hologram of late singer Amy Winehouse, which was created by the company BASE Hologram. The hologram went on tour in 2019, and while some critics were skeptical, many fans were thrilled to see Winehouse “perform” once again.
So, how does it work? Essentially, a performer’s movements and actions are recorded in 3D, and then that data is used to create a hologram that can be projected onto a stage. The hologram is synced up to a live band, and it appears as if the performer is actually on stage.
Of course, creating a hologram musician isn’t cheap. It can cost millions of dollars to create the 3D recordings and the technology needed to project the hologram. But for companies willing to invest, the potential rewards are enormous. Hologram performers could tour indefinitely, never needing a break, and potentially making millions of dollars in ticket sales.
But there are also ethical questions to consider. Some people argue that creating hologram performers is disrespectful to the memory of the original artists. Others worry that it could lead to a future where live performers become obsolete, and all concerts are simply projections.
Despite these concerns, it seems that the hologram musician trend is only going to continue growing. BASE Hologram has plans to create hologram tours for artists such as Whitney Houston and Buddy Holly. And even living artists are getting in on the action, with companies creating hologram versions of stars like Hatsune Miku, a Japanese virtual pop star.
It’s clear that hologram musicians are a new frontier in the music industry. While the technology is still in its early stages, it’s exciting to think about the possibilities. Who knows - in a few years, we may be seeing hologram concerts that are indistinguishable from the real thing.
