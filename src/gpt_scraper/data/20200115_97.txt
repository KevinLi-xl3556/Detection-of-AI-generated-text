On 14 July 2015, world powers including the United States, Britain, Germany, France, China, and Russia signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. The deal, aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program in return for economic sanctions relief, was seen as a breakthrough in the decades-long conflict between the West and Iran. However, in May 2018, the United States withdrew from the JCPOA and re-imposed sanctions, prompting Iran to respond by announcing that it would increase its uranium enrichment levels.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani is now lashing out at European nations, who have been attempting to salvage the nuclear deal, which US President Joe Biden has signaled a willingness to rejoin. Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Rouhani accused European nations of failing to live up to their commitment to the deal and blamed them for its collapse.
“The Europeans are being completely hypocritical,” Rouhani said. “They’re saying that they’re trying to save the deal, but they’re not doing anything to actually save it. They’re not fulfilling their commitments under the deal, and they’re not standing up to the United States.”
Rouhani’s comments come as Iran continues to increase its uranium enrichment levels, pushing the limits of the JCPOA. In response, the European Union has expressed concern over Iran’s actions and called for restraint. However, Rouhani maintained that Iran’s actions were necessary to pressure the United States to rejoin the deal.
“We’re not trying to violate the deal,” Rouhani said. “We’re trying to make it clear that the United States needs to reverse its decision to withdraw from the deal and rejoin it. If they do, we’ll return to our commitments under the deal. If not, we’ll continue to increase our enrichment levels.”
The tension between Iran and European nations, as well as the United States, has increased in recent months, with both sides accusing each other of not living up to their commitments under the JCPOA. While President Biden has expressed a desire to rejoin the deal, he has also said that Iran must first return to compliance with its terms. Rouhani, however, has argued that the United States must take the first step by lifting its sanctions.
Despite the tensions, there are still some signs of hope that the nuclear deal can be salvaged. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, with European powers offering Iran economic incentives in exchange for compliance with the deal. However, the path forward remains uncertain, and the future of the JCPOA is still in doubt.
As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: tensions between Iran and the West are unlikely to ease anytime soon. With both sides accusing each other of bad faith, it’s up to diplomatic efforts to find a way forward and prevent a further escalation of the conflict.
