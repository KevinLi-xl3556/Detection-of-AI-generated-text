As the 2020 Presidential Election is drawing near, the political climate in the United States of America is getting increasingly heated. President Donald Trump had been accused of trying to dirty the Biden name to win the election, and it seems he is not done yet.
Joe Biden, the former Vice President of the United States, announced his candidacy for President back in April 2019. Since then, he had been the front-runner in the polls, challenging Donald Trump’s re-election. However, Trump and his team tried to find ways to sully and damage the reputation of Joe Biden and his family.
One such attempt was the investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, in Ukraine. Trump and his allies accused the Bidens of being involved in corrupt dealings with Ukrainian oil and gas firm Burisma Holdings while Joe Biden was Vice President. These accusations were never proven, and the impeachment of President Trump, which was based on these allegations, was ultimately unsuccessful.
Despite this, President Trump and his campaign continue to base their attacks on Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. They insist on highlighting his past addiction struggles and his business associations in Ukraine and China. Trump’s team even went so far as to release unverified emails suggesting that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to executives at a Ukrainian energy firm.
Despite the lack of any clear evidence of corruption or wrongdoing, these attacks on Joe Biden and his son had resulted in a cloud of suspicion over the Biden family, leading to concerns that Trump’s efforts may still damage Biden’s chances of winning the election.
Joe Biden himself has been running a campaign based on a message of unity, inclusiveness, and restoring American values. However, his message may be overshadowed by the constant attacks and allegations made by Trump, who seems to be willing to say and do anything to win the election.
In short, while the accusations against the Bidens have yet to be proven or substantiated, they have nonetheless cast a long shadow over the election cycle. Trump’s campaign is still using these allegations to dirty Biden’s name and, by extension, damage his chance of winning the presidency. It remains to be seen whether the efforts of the Trump campaign will be successful or if Joe Biden’s message will resonate with the majority of voters.
