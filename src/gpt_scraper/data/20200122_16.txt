Smokers Should Quit at Least 4 Weeks Before Surgery, W.H.O. says
The World Health Organization (WHO) has long been an advocate for the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting. In a recent statement, the organization has advised smokers to quit at least four weeks before undergoing surgery to minimize their risk of complications.
Smoking is a major risk factor for a variety of health problems, including heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke. It can also lead to poor wound healing, infection, and complications during and after surgery. The nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes can constrict blood vessels, reducing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs, which can impair the body’s ability to heal after surgery.
According to the WHO, quitting smoking before surgery can reduce the risk of complications, such as infections, heart and lung problems, and delayed wound healing. The organization recommends that patients quit smoking for at least four weeks before surgery and refrain from smoking for at least four weeks after surgery to promote healing and reduce the risk of complications.
The WHO’s advice is supported by research that shows that quitting smoking before surgery can improve outcomes. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons found that smokers who quit smoking for at least four weeks before surgery had a lower risk of complications than those who continued to smoke.
Quitting smoking can be challenging, but there are many resources available to help smokers quit. The WHO recommends that smokers speak with their healthcare provider about quitting smoking and seek support from family and friends. Nicotine replacement therapy, such as nicotine patches or gum, can also be helpful in managing cravings.
In addition to the health benefits of quitting smoking before surgery, there are many other benefits to quitting smoking. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and quitting smoking can reduce the risk of developing many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Quitting smoking can also improve lung function, reduce the risk of respiratory infections, and improve overall quality of life.
In conclusion, the World Health Organization recommends that smokers quit smoking for at least four weeks before surgery to minimize the risk of complications and improve outcomes. Quitting smoking can be challenging, but the health benefits are well worth the effort. Smokers should seek support from healthcare providers, family, and friends, and consider using nicotine replacement therapy to manage cravings. Quitting smoking is one of the best things smokers can do for their health, and it is never too late to quit.
