SpaceX Launch: Highlights From the Crew Dragon Safety Test
SpaceX made history on May 30, 2020, when their Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Launch Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The goal was to send NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the Crew Dragon spacecraft. This was the first time a private company launched humans into orbit and marked the return of American crewed spaceflight capability. However, before the mission could be deemed a success, the Crew Dragon had to complete a crucial safety test.
The Crew Dragon’s safety test involved demonstrating the spacecraft’s ability to abort a launch in case of an emergency. The test was done in two phases, the first phase involved a ground test of the spacecraft’s launch abort system. The second phase, which took place on January 19, 2020, was a demonstration of the spacecraft’s in-flight abort capability. The in-flight abort capability test simulated an emergency in which the Falcon 9 rocket malfunctioned mid-flight. The Crew Dragon then had to separate from the rocket and deploy its engines to escape the malfunctioning rocket.
The test was crucial in determining the spacecraft’s ability to protect astronauts during a real emergency. It had been months since SpaceX publicly validated the spacecraft’s in-flight abort system. But the success of the Crew Dragon carrying out the test meant that there was now overwhelming confidence in its ability to keep its passengers safe during launch.
During the test, the first phase involved using the spacecraft’s launch abort system that allowed Crew Dragon to separate from the Falcon 9 rocket. The second phase, in-flight abort test, was the critical one. The Falcon 9 rocket’s engines were deliberately shut down seventy-five seconds after takeoff, forcing the Crew Dragon to rapidly deploy its SuperDraco engines. The engines triggered at 400 miles per hour, and the spacecraft accelerated to nearly two thousand miles per hour in less than ten seconds. Shortly after, the Crew Dragon separated from the rocket and deployed parachutes before landing safely in the Atlantic ocean.
The successful completion of the Crew Dragon’s safety test was a significant achievement for SpaceX, as it meant that the spacecraft had demonstrated its ability to ensure the safety of astronauts in emergency situations. The achievement also paved the way for the Crew Dragon’s subsequent successful launch to the ISS with two astronauts aboard.
In conclusion, the Crew Dragon’s safety test was a crucial step in the development of SpaceX’s spacecraft. The successful completion of the test demonstrated that the Crew Dragon had the necessary safety features to protect astronauts’ lives in an emergency. The success of the test gave SpaceX the confidence to move forward with their plans to launch astronauts to space aboard the Crew Dragon.
