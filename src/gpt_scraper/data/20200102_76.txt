Baghdad, Indonesia, Australia: Your Thursday Briefing
Welcome to your Thursday briefing, where we bring you the latest news and updates from around the world. Today, we focus on three countries: Iraq, Indonesia, and Australia.
Baghdad, Iraq:
In the early hours of Thursday morning, a series of explosions rocked the capital city of Baghdad. Reports indicate that at least six explosions occurred in different areas of the city, causing widespread panic and destruction. The attacks, which have not been claimed by any group, come as Iraq struggles with ongoing political turmoil and violence. The Iraqi government has condemned the attacks and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Indonesia:
Indonesia continues to battle a surge in COVID-19 cases, with hospitals and healthcare facilities overwhelmed by the influx of patients. The country reported over 6,000 new cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases to over 1.7 million. The government has implemented stricter lockdown measures in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, but the measures have been met with resistance in some areas. In addition to the COVID-19 crisis, Indonesia is also dealing with a string of natural disasters, including a recent volcanic eruption and deadly floods.
Australia:
In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a major overhaul of the country’s aged care system in response to a damning report on the sector. The report, which was released last year, revealed widespread neglect and abuse in aged care facilities across the country. The reforms will include increased funding, mandatory staff-to-resident ratios, and a new independent regulator. The move has been welcomed by advocacy groups and families of aged care residents, who have long been calling for reform in the sector.
In other news, the Australian government has also announced plans to build a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales, despite criticism from environmental groups. The government says the plant is needed to ensure a reliable energy supply and to support jobs in the region, but opponents argue that it will exacerbate climate change and undermine Australia’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions.
That’s all for today’s briefing. Stay safe and stay informed.
