Scientists have discovered the Earth’s oldest known asteroid impact in Western Australia. The impact occurred nearly 2.2 billion years ago, during a time when Earth’s atmosphere only contained a fraction of the oxygen seen today.
The asteroid, estimated to be between 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter, struck an area that was once a shallow sea. The impact created a crater roughly 200 kilometers in diameter, that has now been eroded away by the passage of time and geological processes.
To identify the age of the impact, researchers used a combination of techniques including isotopic dating of minerals and geological mapping. They found that the impact occurred during the Early Proterozoic era, a time when a diverse range of single-celled organisms dominated the planet.
The discovery of the impact provides a unique window into Earth’s geological history, and sheds light on a time when the planet was very different from what it is today. It also has implications for our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth.
The asteroid impact would have had a significant effect on the environment, causing widespread fires and earthquakes, and potentially creating a temporary greenhouse effect due to the release of gases into the atmosphere. The impact could have also had a more long-term effect on the evolution of life, by creating new habitats and opportunities for biological diversity.
The discovery is also significant because it provides a benchmark for the earliest known evidence of asteroid impacts. By studying the geological record and using dating techniques, scientists are able to piece together a timeline of impacts that have shaped the history of our planet.
Overall, the discovery of the Earth’s oldest known asteroid impact is a remarkable find that will help scientists deepen their understanding of our planet’s early history and evolution. It is a testament to the power and importance of geological research, and a reminder that our planet has been shaped by countless forces over billions of years.
