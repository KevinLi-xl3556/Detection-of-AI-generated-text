In March 2019, a Boeing 737 Max 8 plane operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 passengers and crew. The tragedy was the second of its kind in just a few months, following the Lion Air crash in October 2018, which claimed the lives of 189 people. In the aftermath of these crashes, questions were raised about the safety of the 737 Max 8, as well as Boeing’s role in the disaster.
Now, more than a decade after a similar incident involving a Boeing plane, Dutch officials have published a study critical of the aerospace company. The study, which was carried out by the Dutch Safety Board, analyzed a crash that occurred in February 2009, in which a Turkish Airlines flight crashed near Amsterdam, killing nine people and injuring 120 more.
According to the study, the crash was the result of a combination of technical problems and human error. The plane’s altimeter, which is used to measure altitude, was not functioning properly, and the pilots made several errors in attempting to troubleshoot the problem. Ultimately, the plane stalled and crashed.
The study also noted several deficiencies in Boeing’s design and testing of the altimeter, as well as in its communication with airline operators and pilots. It criticized the company for failing to adequately address known issues with the altimeter, and for not providing clear guidance to pilots on how to handle such problems.
While the study was focused specifically on the 2009 crash, its findings are likely to have significant implications for the ongoing investigation of the 737 Max 8 crashes. In both cases, technical problems with the planes’ automated systems played a role, and in both cases, pilots struggled to regain control of the aircraft.
Critics of Boeing have long argued that the company prioritizes profits over safety, and that it has too much influence over regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The publication of the Dutch study is likely to fuel these criticisms, and to add to the growing calls for greater accountability and transparency in the aerospace industry.
In response to the study, Boeing has emphasized that it has made significant changes to its design and testing processes in the years since the 2009 crash. It has also pledged to continue working closely with regulators to ensure the safety of its aircraft.
As investigations into the 737 Max 8 crashes continue, it remains to be seen what further revelations will emerge about Boeing’s role in the disasters. However, the Dutch study is a powerful reminder of the importance of thorough and transparent investigation in the pursuit of aviation safety.
