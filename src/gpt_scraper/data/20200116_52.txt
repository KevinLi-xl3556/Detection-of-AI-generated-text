Christopher Tolkien, the son of J.R.R. Tolkien, passed away on January 16, 2020, at the age of 95. Christopher was best known as a literary executor and chronicler of his father’s works, particularly the “Middle-earth” universe that his father created.
Born in Leeds, England in 1924, Christopher was the third child of J.R.R. Tolkien and Edith Tolkien. He was raised around the stories and mythologies that his father created, and this fostered in him a deep love and appreciation for the worlds that his father had crafted.
After serving in World War II, Christopher went on to pursue a career in academia, eventually becoming a professor of Old and Middle English at the University of Oxford. However, his most significant contribution was in the literary world, as he dedicated much of his life to editing and publishing his father’s unfinished works.
Following his father’s death in 1973, Christopher took on the task of sorting through his father’s extensive archives and unfinished manuscripts. He painstakingly compiled and edited many of his father’s posthumous works, including “The Silmarillion,” “Unfinished Tales,” and “The Children of Hurin.”
Christopher’s work helped to expand and enrich the “Middle-earth” universe, providing fans with greater insight into its history and mythology. He also published many of his father’s illustrations, maps, and other artwork, bringing to life the incredible world that his father had imagined.
In addition to his father’s works, Christopher wrote and edited many books about the “Middle-earth” universe, providing in-depth analysis and commentary on the history and culture of the various races and regions within it.
Christopher Tolkien’s contributions to literature were widely recognized and celebrated. In 1992, he was awarded the Bodley Medal by the University of Oxford, and in 2017, he received the Inklings Fellowship Award for his contributions to the study of J.R.R. Tolkien’s works.
Christopher Tolkien’s death marks the end of an era, but his legacy will live on through the books and works that he helped to compile and publish. His passion and devotion to his father’s creations inspire a new generation of writers, scholars, and fans, who continue to find wonder and inspiration in the incredible universe that J.R.R. Tolkien created.
