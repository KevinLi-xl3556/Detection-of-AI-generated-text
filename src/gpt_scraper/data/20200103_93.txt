College basketball has always been a sport where age and experience can make all the difference. And while the game has certainly evolved over the years, one thing that has remained constant is the importance of having a wise and experienced coach at the helm.
In recent years, there has been a trend of younger coaches getting hired to lead major college basketball programs. These “glory day hires” often come with impressive playing resumes and fresh ideas, but they can also lack the experience and perspective needed to succeed in the high-pressure world of college hoops.
Enter the sages of college basketball. These older coaches have been around the game for decades, and they have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be invaluable to up-and-coming coaches. Whether they are serving as mentors, advisors, or even assistants, these sages can play a critical role in helping younger coaches navigate the challenges of running a major college basketball program.
One example of this dynamic can be seen at the University of Michigan, where former head coach John Beilein recently stepped down after leading the Wolverines to two Final Four appearances. Beilein, who is 68 years old, is widely respected as one of the best coaches in the game, and he has a long history of mentoring younger coaches. In fact, several of his former assistants have gone on to become successful head coaches in their own right, including Bacari Alexander (Detroit Mercy), LaVall Jordan (Butler), and Billy Donlon (formerly of Wright State and UMKC).
Beilein’s successor at Michigan is Juwan Howard, a former NBA player who had no prior head coaching experience before taking over the Wolverines. Howard was a “glory day hire” in every sense of the term, and many wondered if he would be able to succeed at a program as prestigious as Michigan. But with Beilein’s guidance and support, Howard has thrived, leading the Wolverines to a Big Ten championship and a trip to the Elite Eight in just his second season on the job.
Another example of this dynamic can be seen at Duke University, where head coach Mike Krzyzewski (better known as “Coach K”) has been a mentor to countless coaches over the course of his legendary career. Krzyzewski, who is 74 years old, has won five national championships and is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time. But he has also been generous with his time and expertise, and he has helped to shape the careers of numerous younger coaches.
One of those coaches is Tommy Amaker, who played for Krzyzewski at Duke in the 1980s and went on to become a successful head coach at Seton Hall, Michigan, and Harvard. Amaker has spoken frequently about the impact that Krzyzewski has had on his career, both as a player and as a coach. “Coach K is a legend, but he’s also a mentor and a friend,” Amaker has said. “I wouldn’t be where I am today without his guidance and support.”
Of course, not every older coach is interested in serving as a mentor or advisor to younger coaches. Some prefer to remain focused on their own programs and their own careers, and that’s perfectly fine. But for those who are willing to lend a helping hand, the impact can be profound. By sharing their knowledge, experience, and wisdom, these sages of college basketball can help to ensure that the sport continues to thrive for generations to come.
