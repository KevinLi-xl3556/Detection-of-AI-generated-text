As the weekend approaches, several notable events have captured the attention of the world. From the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington D.C., to the latest developments in the British royal family, and the latest achievements of SpaceX, there is a lot to keep up with. Here is your weekend briefing on these hot topics.
Impeachment
The impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is still ongoing in the United States Senate. The trial started on Tuesday, February 9th and has been full of dramatic moments. The trial is centered around the role of the former President in inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th. The first day saw the debate over whether or not the trial itself was constitutional, with a vote of 56-44 stating that it was. The trial has continued with emotional video footage and testimony from those involved in the events on January 6th. It remains to be seen what the verdict of the trial will be, as it requires a two-thirds majority, however, it is clear that the implications of this historic trial will be far-reaching.
Royal Family
On Sunday, February 14th, the British royal family faced a major blow as Prince Philip was admitted to the hospital as a precautionary measure. The 99-year-old Duke of Edinburgh is said to have been feeling unwell for a number of days before being admitted, and Buckingham Palace has confirmed that it is not related to covid-19. As the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, the Prince’s health is always closely monitored, and with both himself and the Queen having received the covid-19 vaccine in recent weeks, it is hoped that he will make a full and speedy recovery.
SpaceX
In July 2020, NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken made history by being the first humans to be launched into orbit by a privately-owned space company, SpaceX. However, the company has not rested on its laurels since then. Over the past weekend, SpaceX successfully launched another Falcon 9 rocket, this time carrying 60 Starlink internet satellites into orbit. Deploying satellites in low Earth orbit is just one part of SpaceX’s ambitious plan to provide high-speed internet to even remote areas of the world, and this latest launch brings the total number of Starlink satellites to over 1,000. With plans to launch even more this year, SpaceX is making waves in the space industry and shows no signs of slowing down.
In conclusion, these three events- impeachment, the royal family, and SpaceX- are just a snapshot of the news and events happening around the world this weekend. Whether it’s politics, global matters, or technological advancements, there is always something to keep us engaged and informed.
