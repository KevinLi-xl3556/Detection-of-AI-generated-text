Ex-Rep. Chris Collins Gets 26-Month Prison Sentence in Insider Trading Case
Former Republican Congressman Chris Collins has been sentenced to 26 months in prison after being found guilty of insider trading. The case has been making headlines since 2018 when Collins was charged with using inside information to make trades in a pharmaceutical company. Despite initially denying any wrongdoing, Collins eventually pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to the FBI.
The case has been closely watched because of Collins’ close ties to the Trump administration. Collins was the first congressman to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016, and he was a member of the Trump transition team. The case has raised questions about the culture of corruption in Washington and the ethics of politicians who trade on inside information.
The charges against Collins stem from his time as a board member of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian biotech company. In June 2017, Collins learned that a clinical trial for a drug developed by the company had failed. Collins passed the information along to his son, who was also an Innate Immunotherapeutics shareholder, and several other people, including the father of his son’s fiancée.
Collins’ son and the others he passed the information along to sold their shares in the company before the information was made public, avoiding losses of around $750,000. Collins himself didn’t sell his shares, but the government argued that he avoided losses of more than $570,000 by passing the information along to others.
In addition to his prison sentence, Collins has been fined $200,000 and ordered to serve two years of supervised release after his release from prison. He has also been banned from serving as a director or officer of any public company. Collins’ lawyers had asked for a sentence of probation, citing his age (69) and his record of public service.
The judge who sentenced Collins, however, said that the case was serious and that a prison sentence was necessary to deter others from committing similar crimes. “The message must be sent that those who engage in insider trading will be punished severely,” the judge said.
The case has brought renewed attention to the issue of insider trading in Washington. While it is technically illegal for lawmakers to trade on inside information, there is no clear definition of what constitutes “insider information.” Some lawmakers have called for clearer rules on the issue, while others have argued that the existing laws are adequate.
Regardless of what happens with the laws, the case against Chris Collins serves as a reminder that politicians are not above the law. The public expects its elected officials to act with integrity and to serve the public interest, not their own narrow financial interests. As Collins begins his prison sentence, it’s a message that should resonate with politicians across the country.
