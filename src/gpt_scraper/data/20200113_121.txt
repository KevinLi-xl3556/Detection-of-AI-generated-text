The U.S. presidential election is just a few months away, and the race between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is heating up. But this election is about more than just who will occupy the Oval Office. It’s also about the vision of the presidency that will prevail in America for the next four years, and beyond.
And that vision is one of the key things that’s on trial in this election. Because over the last four years, President Trump has presented a vision of the presidency that is frighteningly authoritarian, divisive, and undemocratic. And by doing so, he’s fundamentally challenged what Americans expect from their leaders, and from their democracy.
Trump’s vision of the presidency is rooted in a belief in his own absolute power. He’s shown little regard for the norms and traditions that have governed American politics for centuries, and he’s actively sought to undermine the checks and balances that keep the presidency in check.
For example, he’s repeatedly attacked the independence of the judiciary, labeling judges who issue decisions he disagrees with as “Obama judges” or “Clinton judges.” He’s encouraged law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute his political enemies, and he’s even suggested that he might refuse to accept the outcome of the election if he loses.
All of this has eroded Americans’ faith in their democracy, and it’s made them wonder whether their country is still the beacon of freedom and justice that it’s always claimed to be.
But the good news is that Trump’s vision of the presidency isn’t the only one on offer in this election. His opponent, Joe Biden, has presented a very different vision - one that’s based on respect for democratic norms and institutions, and a commitment to working across party lines to find common ground.
Biden has emphasized the importance of restoring America’s values of decency, dignity, and respect for all. He’s talked about his plans to strengthen democracy by ensuring fair and free elections, defending the rule of law, and boosting public confidence in government.
And he’s committed to working tirelessly to heal the deep divisions that have torn the country apart during Trump’s presidency.
This election, then, is about more than just choosing between two candidates. It’s about choosing between two very different futures for America - one that’s based on fear, division, and authoritarianism, and one that’s based on hope, healing, and respect.
As voters head to the polls this November, they’ll be deciding not just who they want to lead the country, but what kind of country they want to live in. And if they choose Biden and his vision of the presidency, they’ll be signaling that they want a return to the values that have always made America great - and that they want to build a future that’s characterized by unity, progress, and democracy.
