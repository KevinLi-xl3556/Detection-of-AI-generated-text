In the lead-up to the 92nd Academy Awards, the Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) and Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) have unveiled their nominations for the best films of the year. Topping both lists are “Parasite,” “1917,” and “The Irishman.”
Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” is a darkly comedic thriller that has captivated audiences and critics alike. The film tells the story of a poor South Korean family that infiltrates the wealthy household of a well-to-do family. As tensions escalate, the two families become locked in a battle for survival. “Parasite” has been heralded for its thrilling plot, biting social commentary, and outstanding ensemble cast.
“1917,” directed by Sam Mendes, is an epic war film that follows two British soldiers as they race across enemy lines to deliver a message that could save thousands of lives. The film has been praised for its stunning cinematography, immersive sound design, and emotionally resonant performances.
Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” is a crime drama that spans decades in the life of Frank Sheeran, a hitman who becomes entangled with some of the most notorious figures in 20th century American history. The film features powerhouse performances from Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, and has been lauded for its thoughtful, meditative take on the mafia genre.
Other notable nominees across both guilds include “Joker,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” and “Ford v Ferrari.” While the P.G.A. and D.G.A. nominations are not a definitive indicator of which films will win big at the Oscars, they do offer a strong indication of which movies are resonating most with industry insiders.
As the awards season heats up, it will be interesting to see how these nominations shape the conversation around the best films of 2019. Whether it’s the timely social commentary of “Parasite,” the technical mastery of “1917,” or the classical Hollywood glamour of “The Irishman,” one thing is clear: this year’s crop of nominees is one of the strongest and most diverse in recent memory.
