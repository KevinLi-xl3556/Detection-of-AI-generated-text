In a move that has generated controversy both at home and abroad, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has announced the end of the country’s search for missing persons from the country’s long civil war, saying that it is impossible to bring back the dead.
The announcement, made on April 21, marked a significant turning point in the country’s efforts to address the legacy of its decades-long conflict, which ended in 2009. Since then, Sri Lanka has struggled to come to terms with the scale of the violence and the number of people who went missing during the fighting.
According to government estimates, as many as 20,000 people are still unaccounted for, and families of the missing have long called for an investigation into their loved ones’ disappearance. However, the government has been criticized for its slow progress in addressing the issue, and many families have accused the authorities of covering up the truth about what happened to their relatives.
In his statement, Rajapaksa argued that the government had done everything possible to locate missing persons, but that the scale of the problem was too large to be fully addressed. “I understand the pain of those who are still searching for their loved ones, but we must also accept that we cannot bring back the dead,” he said. “We must now focus on the future and move forward as a united country.”
The decision has been met with anger and dismay by many human rights groups and families of the missing, who argue that the government has a responsibility to do everything possible to uncover the truth about what happened during the war. Amnesty International has called the move a “shocking abdication of responsibility,” while the United Nations has warned that it could lead to further human rights abuses.
Critics of the government have also accused Rajapaksa of using the announcement to distract from other pressing issues facing the country, such as the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and rising tensions with neighboring India.
Despite the controversy, the government has stood firm on its decision, arguing that it is time for the country to move on from the legacy of the war. “We cannot keep looking back,” said Rajapaksa. “We must look forward and work together to build a better future for all Sri Lankans.”
However, many families of the missing say they will not give up their search for the truth. “We will never stop fighting for justice for our loved ones,” said one protester. “The government may have given up, but we will not.”
The debate over Sri Lanka’s search for missing persons is likely to continue for many years to come, as the country struggles to come to terms with the aftermath of its long and bloody conflict. While the government may have ended its search, the families of the missing will continue to demand answers and justice for their loved ones.
