Lesson of the Day: ‘Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories.’
The United States has a complicated history that is often told in different ways depending on where you are in the country. This is particularly true when it comes to how American history is taught in schools. A recent article in The New York Times, titled “Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories,” highlights how the way history is taught can vary widely between different states, and even between different textbooks.
The article focuses on the experience of one teacher, Sarah Cooper, who taught history in Texas and then moved to North Carolina. Cooper was struck by the differences in the textbooks she was using in the two states. In Texas, she was required to use a textbook that portrayed slavery as a “side issue” in the lead up to the Civil War. In North Carolina, by contrast, the textbook emphasized the importance of slavery as a cause of the conflict.
This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the differences in how American history is taught in different parts of the country. The article goes on to describe how other states, including California, New York, and Florida, have their own unique approaches to teaching history. Some states focus on local history, while others emphasize national events. Some textbooks are more explicit about the role of prejudice and discrimination in American history, while others gloss over these aspects of the past.
The implications of these differences are significant. As the article notes, the way history is taught shapes the way we understand the present. If students are taught a version of history that downplays the harm and injustice that people of color have experienced, for example, they may not fully appreciate the scale and depth of contemporary racial disparities.
Moreover, the way history is taught can also shape our politics. If Americans are taught to see their country as a shining beacon of freedom and democracy, for example, they may be less inclined to support efforts to redress past wrongs or address current inequalities.
The article concludes by calling for a national conversation about how American history is taught. This conversation, it argues, should involve not only educators and historians, but also policymakers, community leaders, and ordinary citizens. Only by coming together and grappling with the complexities of the past, the article suggests, can we hope to create a more just and equitable present and future.
Overall, “Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories” is a thought-provoking article that highlights the challenges of teaching American history in a diverse and divided country. As the article makes clear, history is never simple or straightforward. Yet by engaging with the messiness and contradictions of the past, we can work towards a more inclusive and accurate portrayal of our shared story.
