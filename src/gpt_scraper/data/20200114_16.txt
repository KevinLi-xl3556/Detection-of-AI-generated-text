The January 2020 Democratic Debate witnessed seven major Democratic candidates take the stage to discuss their plans and policies for the United States’ presidency. As the debate unfolded, several themes emerged, highlighting the candidates’ varying opinions and stances on the critical issues of the day. Here are six significant takeaways from the 2020 January Democratic Debate:


Healthcare was front and center: All the candidates agreed that healthcare was a critical issue in the United States. However, there were significant differences in their approach to healthcare. While some candidates argued for a single-payer Medicare-for-all plan covering everyone, others, including Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, advocated for building upon the Affordable Care Act.


Questions of experience: With the recent developments in United States foreign policy, there were questions about the candidates’ experience in dealing with foreign affairs. In this regard, Elizabeth Warren emerged as the candidate with the most extensive experience, working on foreign policy issues for over a decade. However, others like Pete Buttigieg highlighted the need for generational change in leadership.


Climate change was a top priority: Climate change took center stage, with all candidates offering solutions and plans to tackle the urgent issue. Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer were particularly vocal about their plans to address climate change head-on, with Steyer emphasizing the need for collaboration across different sectors to achieve environmental targets.


Foreign policy issues took center stage: With the current US-Iran tensions, the debate tackled foreign policy issues as a high priority. Joe Biden, in particular, argued for the need for diplomacy, while Pete Buttigieg sought to highlight the need for a more nuanced foreign policy approach.


Diversity in immigration policies: The issue of immigration, and specifically diversity in immigration, remained a divisive issue for the candidates. While most of the candidates agreed on the need for comprehensive immigration reform, there was a split in opinion over whether or not to give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship.


The need for unity: As the debate drew to a close, all the candidates emphasized the need for unity and the ability to unite different factions to win the election. Bernie Sanders, in particular, highlighted how he has a track record of bringing progressives and moderates together.


In conclusion, the January 2020 Democratic Debate highlighted the significant issues facing the United States in the upcoming presidential election. The candidates expressed their differing views and brought up new solutions, offering voters a wide range of options to choose from. Ultimately, the debate underscored the importance of civic engagement and the need for voters to be informed and active participants in shaping the future of the United States.
