Roger Scruton, a Provocative Public Intellectual, Dies at 75
Roger Scruton, a British philosopher and writer who championed conservative ideas, passed away on January 12th, 2020, at the age of 75. His death marks the end of a long and storied career that spanned over four decades, during which he became one of the most prominent and controversial public intellectuals of our time.
Born in 1944, Scruton grew up in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. After studying at Cambridge, he went on to teach philosophy at Birkbeck College, London, before becoming a freelance writer and broadcaster in the 1980s. Throughout his career, he authored over fifty books on topics ranging from aesthetics and politics to religion and culture.
Scruton was known for his controversial views on a variety of issues, including conservatism, nationalism, and Islam. He was a vocal critic of modern architecture and a proponent of traditional forms of beauty. He also played a key role in the intellectual development of the Conservative Party in the UK, serving as an advisor to Margaret Thatcher during her time in office.
However, Scruton’s reputation as a leading conservative thinker was overshadowed by a number of controversies in later years. He was accused of supporting racist and anti-Semitic ideas and was subsequently removed as a government advisor on housing policy in 2019. Scruton strongly denied these allegations and claimed that his words were taken out of context.
Despite the controversy surrounding his later years, Scruton’s legacy as a provocative public intellectual cannot be denied. He challenged conventional wisdom and forced people to reconsider their assumptions about the world we live in. His impact on the conservative movement in the UK and beyond cannot be overstated.
In his last interview with the New Statesman, Scruton spoke about his own legacy, stating: “I hope that people will see me as a person who stood up for the things that were being forgotten…and who will stand up for them long after I’m gone.”
Roger Scruton may be gone, but his provocative ideas and legacy will continue to live on.
