Hudson Yards was supposed to be a groundbreaking development project in New York City, with promises of incorporating public green space into the design. However, recent discoveries have exposed a misleading reality - Hudson Yards did provide a park, but it also came with a giant wall that was never mentioned.
The development project, which opened in March 2019, is home to the largest private real estate development in the United States. The corporate-funded initiative, costing at least $20 billion, focuses on luxury residential apartments, office space, shopping, dining, and entertainment options.
Despite Hudson Yards’ scale, its much-hyped green space is relatively small. A section on the south part of the development, called The Plaza, was designed to be a public gathering spot, but that is not the primary park.
The “public” park, Hudson Yards Park, is actually a privately-owned space that is under the watch of a nonprofit organization, Hudson Yards Park and Boulevard Maintenance District. The group is proficient in preserving and promoting the private interests of the developers in the area. The “park” is surrounded by walls up to 14 feet high, which make it feel boxy and not very open.
Critics have raised concerns that many New Yorkers have never heard of the privately-run Hudson Yards Maintenance District that created the park, as they never got to vote on its creation. The maintenance district also has the power of designating any open space a ‘public space’ that is not regulated by the New York City Parks Department. The park’s construction was not financed with public funds, so the city has no constitutional claim to regulate the park’s usage.
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the $25 fee developers regularly take per square foot on these properties goes towards maintaining the park, but they still have the discretion to manage its properties.
The wall plays a significant role in separating the green space from the ongoing construction projects happening in Hudson Yards. The development site also stands out geographically by being located above a rail yard, making it difficult to reach for the average New Yorker. This inaccessibility, when added to the large barriers surrounding the park, excludes large parts of the population who were supposed to be the primary beneficiaries of Hudson Yards’ public green space.
While the development provides upscale residences, businesses, and entertainment, it is unclear who Hudson Yards’ green space is aimed towards. Green space is especially necessary in large cities like New York, where the vast majority of citizens do not have regular access to nature or open air. With the walls and gated Maintenance District maintaining absolute control over the “public” park, it raises numerous philosophical questions about public space ownership and civic participation.
Hudson Yards was sold to the public as an advanced development project that would provide accessible, large-scale green spaces. Still, in reality, Hudson Yards has provided yet another example of corporate interest hiding behind the deceitful veneer of a public park. Though Hudson Yards indeed delivered a park, the large wall has diminished the asset as ‘public’ and inaccessible, with limited green space and little engagement with the surrounding community.
