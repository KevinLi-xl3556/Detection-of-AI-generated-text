The Cancer Death Rate in the U.S. sees its sharpest one-year drop in our history, according to the American Cancer Societyâ€™s latest report, released earlier this year.
The report states that the overall cancer death rate has fallen by a remarkable 2.2 percent in 2019 - this is by far the largest one-year drop since experts started keeping records. For context, the previous six-year average decline was 1.5 percent.
The main reason for this significant decline is due to the reduction in smoking and the progress made in cancer treatments. Experts say that smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer death globally. Over the years, the number of smokers has dramatically decreased, with fewer Americans smoking now than ever before. Additionally, treatment options have advanced significantly in recent years, including immune therapies, DNA targeting through precision medicine, and other new treatments that have been found to be much more effective than previous drugs.
This decline is a reason for optimism, but experts warn that further action is needed to keep this trend heading in the right direction. For example, more needs to be done to reduce the disparities that exist among different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. While the cancer death rate has fallen among all groups, minorities and people who have limited access to healthcare still face higher risks of developing cancer and experiencing poorer outcomes.
Moreover, the report found that progress has not been made evenly across all types of cancer. While lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, has seen the most significant decline, other types of cancer fall at varying rates. For example, there was a 0.4 percent reduction in breast cancer deaths annually, and prostate cancer death rates remained mostly stable on average. This highlights the importance of continuing and expanding research and treatment efforts to combat different types of cancer effectively.
Overall, the report should be hailed as a significant achievement for researchers, advocates, policymakers, and cancer patients and survivors. It reflects the ongoing progress in reducing the burden of cancer in the United States. However, the fight against cancer still has a long way to go, and everyone needs to continue to work together to push cancer death rates down even further. With continued efforts and cooperation, we hope that the decline in cancer death rates will become a long-term trend.
