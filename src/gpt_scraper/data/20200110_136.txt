Welcome to your Friday briefing. In this edition, we’ll be discussing the latest news on Justin Trudeau, Iran, and Prince Harry.
Justin Trudeau:
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made headlines this week for his government’s decision to ban 1,500 types of assault-style weapons. The ban comes in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history, which took place in Nova Scotia last month and left 22 people dead. The ban has been praised by gun control advocates and criticized by gun rights groups, who argue that it infringes on Canadians’ Second Amendment rights. Trudeau has defended the ban, saying that it is necessary to protect public safety.
Iran:
Iran has been in the news this week for a number of reasons. First, the country marked its National Army Day on April 18 with a military parade that included a display of ballistic missiles. The display has raised concerns in the international community, particularly among the United States and its allies, who fear that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
In addition, Iran has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 2 million cases and over 65,000 deaths reported. The country has struggled to contain the virus, and its healthcare system has been strained to the breaking point.
Prince Harry:
Prince Harry has been making headlines this week for his latest project, a mental health series with Oprah Winfrey. The series, titled “The Me You Can’t See,” will premiere on Apple TV+ on May 21 and will feature personal stories from Harry and other celebrities about their experiences with mental health issues. The series aims to break the stigma surrounding mental health and encourage more people to seek help.
Harry has also been in the news for his recent appearance at Prince Philip’s funeral. The Duke of Sussex returned to the UK for the first time since stepping down from royal duties last year and made headlines for his reunion with his brother, Prince William, and his father, Prince Charles.
In conclusion, these are just some of the stories making headlines this week. From Justin Trudeau’s gun ban to Iran’s nuclear program and Prince Harry’s mental health series, there’s never a dull moment in the news. Stay tuned for more updates and have a great weekend!
