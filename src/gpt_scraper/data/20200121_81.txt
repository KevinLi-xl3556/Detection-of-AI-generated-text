In the past, the annual World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland has been a melting pot of influential international figures, discussing the latest global economic issues and touting their contributions to the global economy. However, in recent years, the forum has turned into a stage for politicians to promote their agendas and brag about their accomplishments. This year’s event held in January was no different, with the main focus on the current U.S. President Donald Trump, who was not even in attendance.
Despite the fact that Trump has been a polarizing figure, several of his recent economic accomplishments were well received in Davos, signaling a shift in attitudes towards the president. For example, his recent tax cuts have helped boost the U.S. economy, leading to record low unemployment rates and strong companies’ performances. These results, combined with the solid economic growth, have drawn praise from some business leaders attending the event.
“President Trump is delivering on his promises and it’s producing results,” said IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, who attended this year’s event. “The tax reform in the U.S. is a big deal. There’s no question the U.S. economy is on fire.”
The U.S.-China trade war was also a topic of discussion at Davos. Though Trump’s tough stance has been criticized by some, others argue that his approach is necessary for China to understand that its trade practices have been unfair to the U.S.
“The fact that Trump has called out China on some of their practices is very welcome,” said DHL CEO Frank Appel. “Something had to happen to shift the situation. It could have been another president, but it’s happened under Trump.”
Despite these positive reactions to Trump’s economic policies, his personality and rhetoric continue to rub many attendees the wrong way. In fact, many leaders have spoken out against Trump’s divisive comments and behavior in the past.
“We have to understand that we’re also electing someone who has moral values, who has character, who is inspiring,” said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at Davos this year. “This is not just about economic growth figures.”
Nonetheless, Trump’s pro-business policies have been instrumental in the current U.S. economic upswing, making the crowd in Davos acknowledge his economic impact while sidestepping his personality flaws.
In conclusion, it’s apparent that Trump’s economic policies have had a significant and positive effect on the U.S. economy. While some attendees at Davos still take issue with his style of governance, it’s impossible to ignore the results he has produced. With the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, it will be interesting to see how Trump’s achievements shape the future of American politics and whether his economic successes continue.
