Volcanoes on Venus Might Still Be Smoking
Venus, the second closest planet to the Sun, has long fascinated planetary scientists with its extreme climate and geology. Despite being similar in size and composition to Earth, Venus has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide that traps heat and creates a run-away greenhouse effect, making its surface hotter than the surface of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun.
Recent data from multiple spacecraft missions have revealed new insights into Venus’s past and present, including the possibility that the planet might still be geologically active. One of the most intriguing clues comes from the observation of volcanoes on Venus that appear to emit high levels of sulfur dioxide, a gas commonly associated with volcanic activity on Earth.
In a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, researchers analyzed data from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express mission that orbited Venus between 2006 and 2014. They focused on the Venus Monitoring Camera, which captured images and spectra of the planet’s surface and atmosphere, and looked for evidence of active volcanism.
The team identified four regions on Venus that showed signs of elevated sulfur dioxide levels, all of which were associated with known or suspected volcanic features. One of the regions, called Ganis Chasma, was found to have a concentration of sulfur dioxide that was at least five times higher than the average background level on the planet.
Moreover, the researchers found that the sulfur dioxide plumes appeared to be concentrated in nighttime observations, suggesting that the volcanoes might still be emitting gases and ash that dissipate during the day when the atmospheric temperature rises.
“The discovery of active volcanism on Venus would be a major breakthrough for our understanding of the planet’s evolution and habitability,” said Justin Filiberto, a planetary volcanologist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute and a co-author of the study, in a press release. “If Venus is indeed active today, it would imply that the planet is capable of sustaining some form of interior heat and that volcanic processes could be producing the observed atmospheric gas and ash.”
However, the researchers cautioned that more data and analysis are needed to confirm the presence and nature of ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. They also noted that the Venus Express mission, which ended in 2014, did not have the instruments to directly detect seismic activity or magma flows, two key indicators of active volcanism.
Other researchers have proposed alternative explanations for the observed sulfur dioxide plumes, such as atmospheric chemistry or lightning, but these ideas remain controversial and uncertain.
Still, the possibility that Venus might still be smoking with active volcanoes raises many questions and opportunities for future exploration. NASA and other space agencies are planning new missions to Venus in the coming years that will carry more advanced instruments to study the planet’s surface, subsurface, and atmosphere.
“Venus has always been the underdog planet in terms of exploration and research, but its secrets are starting to reveal,” said Filiberto. “Who knows what else we will discover?”
