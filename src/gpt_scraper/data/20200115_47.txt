Virginia Approves the E.R.A., Becoming the 38th State to Back It
In a historic move, Virginia has become the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (E.R.A.). The state legislature passed the measure on January 27, 2020, finally giving women in the United States the same legal protections as men under the Constitution.
The Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 by Alice Paul, a suffragette and women’s rights advocate. The amendment states that “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” However, it took until 1972 for the measure to pass both houses of Congress.
After the passage of the E.R.A. in Congress, it went to the states for ratification. The amendment needed to be ratified by 38 states to become part of the Constitution. However, that deadline passed in 1982, and only 35 states had ratified it at the time.
Since then, there has been a renewed effort to pass the E.R.A. and put it back on the agenda. That effort received a huge boost when Virginia elected a Democratic majority in its legislature in 2019. With the support of Governor Ralph Northam, Virginia finally became the 38th state to ratify the amendment.
The passage of the E.R.A. in Virginia is a significant milestone for women’s rights in the United States. For too long, women have been treated as second-class citizens, denied the same legal protections as men. The E.R.A. will help to ensure that women are treated fairly and equally under the law, and that their rights are protected.
However, the fight for women’s rights is far from over. Even with the ratification of the E.R.A., there are still many legal and social barriers that must be overcome. Women still face discrimination in the workplace, in education, and in healthcare. Violence against women remains a pervasive and damaging problem in our society. And women of color, LGBTQ women, and other marginalized groups face additional challenges and obstacles.
But the ratification of the E.R.A. is an important step forward. It sends a clear message that women are equal to men under the law, and that their rights must be protected. It is a victory for all women in the United States, and a reminder that there is still work to be done to achieve true equality.
