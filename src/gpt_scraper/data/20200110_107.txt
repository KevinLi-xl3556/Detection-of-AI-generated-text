After a Decade of Hiring, Plenty of Jobs but Raises Are Tiny
The job market has been booming over the last decade, creating plenty of job opportunities across a wide variety of industries. Despite this growth, many workers are finding that the pay increases associated with their jobs are barely keeping up with inflation. This trend has economists and workers alike wondering why it’s happening and what can be done to change it.
According to data gathered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wage growth has remained relatively stagnant despite the fact that the unemployment rate has dropped significantly over the last decade. A report by the Economic Policy Institute shows that for private sector workers, real wage growth from 2009 to 2018 was only 3.3%. Inflation over the same period was 18.6%, meaning that workers are actually taking home less money in real terms than they were a decade ago.
One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the labor market may be more competitive at the entry level than at the higher levels of employment. Many employers may be willing to offer higher salaries to new employees in order to lure them away from their previous jobs, but will be less willing to pay their existing employees more, particularly if those workers aren’t actively seeking new employment.
Another potential factor is that the decreasing power of labor unions has made it more difficult for workers to negotiate for better pay and benefits. As reported by the New York Times, only 6.4% of private sector workers were union members in 2018, down from 9.8% in 2000. Without the collective bargaining power that unions provide, workers’ ability to advocate for themselves has been weakened.
Whatever the cause, the fact remains that many workers are struggling to make ends meet. The increasing costs of healthcare, housing, and education have made it harder for Americans to achieve financial stability, particularly when their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation.
So what can be done to turn the tide? Some economists have suggested implementing policies that would encourage companies to invest more in their workers, such as tax incentives for businesses that increase wages or provide training programs to their employees. Others have called for the establishment of a federal minimum wage that would be adjusted annually based on inflation.
While the causes of the current wage stagnation are complex, there are steps that can be taken to address the issue. Rather than simply accepting the status quo, it’s up to workers, employers, and policymakers to work together to create an economy in which workers can thrive.
