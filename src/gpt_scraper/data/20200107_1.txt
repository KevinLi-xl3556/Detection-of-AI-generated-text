June Bacon-Bercey, 90, Pathbreaking Meteorologist, Is Dead
June Bacon-Bercey, a pioneering figure in the field of meteorology, passed away at the age of 90. As a trailblazing African American woman in a male-dominated field, Bacon-Bercey broke barriers and made significant contributions to meteorology, paving the way for future generations of diverse scientists.
Bacon-Bercey was born on October 23, 1932, in Wichita, Kansas, at a time when opportunities for women, especially women of color, in the sciences were limited. Despite facing discrimination and prejudice, she had an unwavering passion for weather and meteorology from an early age. Her curiosity about the natural world and a deep fascination with the changing patterns of the sky propelled her to pursue a career in meteorology.
In 1954, Bacon-Bercey earned a Bachelor’s degree in meteorology from the University of Kansas, becoming the first African American woman to do so. However, her journey in the field of meteorology was not without challenges. She encountered systemic racism and sexism, which presented obstacles to her career advancement. Despite these setbacks, Bacon-Bercey remained determined and resilient, and she continued to pursue her passion for meteorology.
In the 1960s, Bacon-Bercey joined the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), where she worked as a research meteorologist. She played a pivotal role in the development of the Automated Weather Network, a system that used computers to collect, analyze, and disseminate weather data. Her groundbreaking work in this area revolutionized the field of meteorology, making weather forecasts more accurate and accessible to the public.
Bacon-Bercey’s contributions to meteorology were not limited to her technical expertise. She was also known for her dedication to education and her commitment to promoting diversity in the field. She served as a mentor and role model for aspiring meteorologists, particularly women and underrepresented minorities. Bacon-Bercey believed that diversity in the sciences was crucial for fostering innovation and addressing complex challenges related to climate change and weather forecasting.
In addition to her work at NOAA, Bacon-Bercey had a successful career in broadcast meteorology. She became the first African American woman to earn the American Meteorological Society’s Seal of Approval for Television Weathercasting in 1971. She went on to work as a meteorologist and weather reporter at various television stations across the United States, including in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. Her warm personality, extensive knowledge of meteorology, and pioneering spirit made her a beloved figure in the meteorological community and beyond.
Bacon-Bercey’s groundbreaking achievements and enduring legacy were widely recognized during her lifetime. She received numerous awards and honors, including the prestigious AMS Award for Outstanding Achievement in Weather Communication. In 2000, she was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame for her contributions to broadcast meteorology.
Despite facing significant challenges and discrimination throughout her career, Bacon-Bercey remained steadfast in her pursuit of excellence in meteorology. Her resilience, intelligence, and pioneering spirit continue to inspire generations of meteorologists and scientists, particularly those from underrepresented communities. Her legacy serves as a testament to the importance of diversity and inclusion in the sciences, and her contributions to meteorology will forever be remembered as groundbreaking and trailblazing.
June Bacon-Bercey’s passing is a significant loss to the field of meteorology and to the broader scientific community. Her unwavering passion, groundbreaking achievements, and tireless advocacy for diversity and inclusion will continue to inspire generations of scientists for years to come. As we mourn her loss, we also celebrate her life and legacy as a true pioneer and trailblazer in the field of meteorology. June Bacon-Bercey
