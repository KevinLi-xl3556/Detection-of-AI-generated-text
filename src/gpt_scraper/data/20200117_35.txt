Rapper Pop Smoke, whose real name is Bashar Barakah Jackson, has been charged with grand theft auto after stealing a $375,000 Rolls-Royce, according to reports from the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
The incident occurred in February 2020 when Pop Smoke allegedly took the luxury car on a test drive from a Rolls-Royce dealership in Beverly Hills. The rapper reportedly never returned the vehicle, and it was later found in Arizona.
Pop Smoke was arrested in New York City in July 2020 on an unrelated charge of interstate transportation of stolen goods. He was extradited to Los Angeles, where he now faces charges for grand theft auto.
If convicted, the rapper could face up to three years in prison. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Pop Smoke rose to fame in 2019 with his breakout hit “Welcome to the Party.” The 20-year-old rapper was on the verge of becoming a major star in the music industry when he was tragically shot and killed in February 2020 during a home invasion in Los Angeles.
While Pop Smoke’s death was a devastating loss for his fans and the music industry, the recent charges of grand theft auto only further tarnish his legacy. Theft of any kind is a serious crime, and the consequences can be severe.
As Pop Smoke’s case progresses through the legal system, it serves as a reminder that no one is above the law, regardless of fame or fortune. The justice system is designed to hold individuals accountable for their actions, and it is the responsibility of every citizen to abide by the law.
While it is unclear what the outcome of Pop Smoke’s case will be, it is important to remember that stealing is never acceptable. We must all strive to respect the property of others and uphold the values of honesty and integrity in our daily lives.
