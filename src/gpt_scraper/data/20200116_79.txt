In recent news, the current mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, has been making waves with his unique approach to getting his message across. Instead of typical billboards, posters or social media campaigns, de Blasio has taken to conveying his platform through the ultimate breakfast carb - the bagel.
Dubbed “Message in a Bagel,” de Blasio and his team have been distributing bagels with various messages baked right into the dough. These bagels have become somewhat of a phenomenon, with New Yorkers lining up to get their hands on one.
The idea behind Message in a Bagel is simple yet effective. De Blasio knows that New Yorkers love their bagels, so why not use them to spread his campaign message? The messages he bakes into the bagels are concise and to the point, making them easily digestible for the public. Some of the popular messages include “Affordable Housing for All,” “Universal Pre-K,” and “Tax the Rich.”
The bagels are not only a hit with locals, but they have also gained national attention. News outlets across the country have picked up on the unique marketing tactic, and de Blasio has received praise for his innovative approach.
Of course, not everyone is a fan of de Blasio’s bagel campaign. Critics have pointed out that it’s gimmicky and doesn’t address the real issues facing New York City. Some have even gone as far as to call it a publicity stunt that distracts from more significant problems.
Despite the criticism, de Blasio remains dedicated to his bagel campaign. He sees it as an effective way to communicate with his constituents and engage them in the political process. Plus, who doesn’t love a good bagel?
In conclusion, Bill de Blasio’s Message in a Bagel campaign is a unique and innovative way to spread his platform message. While it may not be to everyone’s taste, it’s hard to argue that it hasn’t been effective in capturing the attention of New Yorkers and the nation. Who knows, maybe other politicians will follow suit and start using pastries to spread their message? One thing is for sure: the humble bagel has never been more exciting.
