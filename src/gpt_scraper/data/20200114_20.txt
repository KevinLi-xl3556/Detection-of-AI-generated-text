Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) has recently announced a new season of talented artists and performers, including actor Riz Ahmed and filmmaker Kahlil Joseph. The upcoming events showcase the variety of talent and creativity BAM has always been known for, continuing its legacy as a leading cultural institution.
Riz Ahmed, a British-Pakistani actor, rapper, and activist, will be performing his live show, “The Long Goodbye,” a poignant and moving exploration of identity, love, and loss. The show features Ahmed performing spoken word poetry, accompanied by live musicians, and is the culmination of his years-long journey to explore his own personal and cultural background.
Kahlil Joseph, an American filmmaker and video artist, will be presenting his latest film, “BLK NWS,” a thought-provoking and immersive visualization of Black News, exploring the intersections of race, identity, and media. Joseph is widely recognized for his imaginative and innovative style and has worked with artists such as Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, and Flying Lotus.
BAM’s new season is not just about introducing new faces but also celebrating the return of some of the most beloved performers. The season will feature the return of the popular tap dance extravaganza “Dorrance Dance,” as well as the return of the Brooklyn-based music and dance ensemble “Sō Percussion,” who will be performing a new work titled “Medley.”
In addition to the live performances, BAM’s new season will also feature a number of virtual events, including a film screening and live conversation with director Spike Lee, who will discuss his groundbreaking film “Do the Right Thing.”
