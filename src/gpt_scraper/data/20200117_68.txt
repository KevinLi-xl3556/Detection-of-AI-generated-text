In recent events, a statement made by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has raised eyebrows regarding the potential surveillance of former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. During an interview with NPR, Pompeo claimed that he had “never heard” about any possibility of Yovanovitch being under surveillance while she served as ambassador.
This statement comes as a surprise to many, given the publicized events surrounding Yovanovitch’s abrupt dismissal as ambassador in May 2019. At the time, it was widely reported that Yovanovitch was recalled from her position due to alleged efforts by President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to push for her removal. It was also reported that Giuliani was working with associates who were under investigation for potential campaign finance violations, which only added to the concern surrounding Yovanovitch’s dismissal.
Furthermore, recent developments in the ongoing impeachment inquiry have added more questions to Yovanovitch’s situation. It was revealed that Lev Parnas, one of Giuliani’s associates who has since been indicted on campaign finance charges, was allegedly involved in efforts to monitor Yovanovitch’s movements and communications. Parnas himself has claimed that this was done at Giuliani’s direction, further implicating Giuliani in the situation.
Given all these factors, it’s hard to believe that someone in Pompeo’s position would not have been aware of the possibility that Yovanovitch was under surveillance. As Secretary of State, Pompeo would have been responsible for overseeing diplomatic efforts in Ukraine, and therefore would be expected to have at least some knowledge of what was happening with the ambassador. Many have criticized Pompeo’s statement as either willfully ignorant or intentionally misleading.
This is not the first time that Pompeo’s actions related to the Ukraine situation have come under scrutiny. In October 2019, he was subpoenaed by Congress for documents related to the impeachment inquiry, which he initially refused to produce. He eventually did turn over some documents, but his overall reluctance to cooperate with the investigation raised additional questions about his role in the events leading up to the inquiry.
Despite his protestations of ignorance regarding Yovanovitch’s surveillance, it seems unlikely that Pompeo will be able to avoid further questioning about the situation. As the impeachment inquiry continues, more details are likely to come to light, and Pompeo may find himself required to provide more detailed answers about his own involvement in the events surrounding Yovanovitch’s dismissal.
