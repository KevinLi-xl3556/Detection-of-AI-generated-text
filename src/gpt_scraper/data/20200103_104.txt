Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is often referred to as the “Trump of the Tropics”, a nod to the similarities between Bolsonaro and the former president of the United States, Donald Trump. However, this comparison is both inaccurate and unfair to Bolsonaro. He has proven himself to be much worse than Trump, both in his policies and his personality.
Firstly, let’s talk about policy. Trump was known for his controversial policies on immigration and climate change, among others. However, Bolsonaro’s policies are even more destructive. Under his leadership, the Brazilian government has loosened protections for the environment, leading to widespread deforestation and destruction of the Amazon rainforest. He has also been accused of promoting violence against marginalized groups, including Indigenous peoples and the LGBTQ+ community. This is a far cry from Trump’s policies, which, while deeply flawed, were not as outright harmful.
Additionally, Bolsonaro’s personality is even more concerning than Trump’s. While Trump was certainly known for his brashness and egotism, Bolsonaro takes things to a whole new level. He has been caught making racist, sexist, and homophobic comments on countless occasions. He has also shown an alarming disregard for the lives and safety of his own citizens, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which he has consistently downplayed and dismissed.
The media has a responsibility to accurately report on world leaders and their actions. By calling Bolsonaro the “Trump of the Tropics”, they give him the same level of legitimacy as Trump, which is simply unacceptable. Bolsonaro’s policies and behavior should not be normalized or excused in any way. He is a dangerous leader who poses a threat to the people of Brazil and the world at large.
In conclusion, Jair Bolsonaro is not the “Trump of the Tropics”. While Trump’s policies and personality were certainly concerning, Bolsonaro takes things to a whole new level. He has shown time and again that he is not fit to lead a country, and the media should stop giving him a platform to do so. It’s time for us to start holding our leaders accountable for their actions, and that starts with calling out Bolsonaro for the dangerous leader that he is.
