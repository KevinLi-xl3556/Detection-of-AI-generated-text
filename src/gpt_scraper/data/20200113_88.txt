In January 2020, a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down by Iran, killing all 176 people on board. The incident sparked global outrage and condemnation, with many countries demanding answers and justice for the victims. One Canadian CEO, however, took to Twitter to express his anger at the United States for its role in the tragedy.
The CEO in question is Michael McCain, the head of Maple Leaf Foods, one of Canada’s largest food companies. On January 8, 2020, just hours after the news of the downed jet broke, McCain tweeted a scathing rebuke of the U.S. government’s actions.
“I am very angry, and time isn’t making me less angry,” McCain wrote in his tweet. “A U.S. government leadership that lies consistently, documented, and said nothing would come of further investigation, lied. An innocent life, slaughtered. And I am livid.”
McCain’s tweet quickly went viral, drawing both praise and criticism from users across social media. Some applauded his outspokenness and willingness to hold the U.S. government accountable for its actions, while others accused him of politicizing a tragedy and unfairly blaming the U.S.
But for McCain, the tweet was a personal and emotional response to the loss of a colleague’s wife and young son, who were among the passengers killed in the crash. In subsequent tweets, he shared photos of the family and expressed his deep sorrow and anger at their senseless deaths.
“The collateral damage of this irresponsible, dangerous, ill-conceived behavior? 63 Canadians needlessly lost their lives in the crossfire, including the family of one of my MLF colleagues,” he wrote.
McCain’s tweets sparked a wider conversation about the role of business leaders in social and political issues, and whether it is appropriate for them to speak out on such matters. Some argued that CEOs have a responsibility to use their platforms and influence to raise awareness and advocate for change, while others cautioned that they should stay neutral and focus solely on their companies’ bottom lines.
In the wake of the controversy, Maple Leaf Foods released a statement in support of McCain’s right to express his opinions on social media. “We support all employees’ rights to a personal opinion on any issue and the right to express that opinion in their own social media accounts,” the company said.
The incident also highlighted the close ties between Canada and the United States, and the impact of political tensions and conflicts on ordinary citizens. The downing of the Ukrainian jet was later attributed to a missile fired by the Iranian military, in what Iranian officials claimed was a mistake due to heightened tensions with the U.S. at the time.
The incident remains a tragic reminder of the human cost of political conflicts and the need for leaders to work towards peaceful solutions and diplomacy. And for Michael McCain, it was a moment of personal grief and anger that sparked a wider conversation about the role of business leaders in society.
