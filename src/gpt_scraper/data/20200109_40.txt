The New Hampshire primary is fast approaching, and the race for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination is heating up. In a state that has proven crucial in past presidential elections, candidates are fighting tooth and nail to secure the support of New Hampshire voters. Two candidates, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard, are hoping to sway voters who have supported Bernie Sanders in previous elections.
Both Yang and Gabbard have campaigned extensively in the Granite State, hoping to leverage Sanders’s previous success to their advantage. Sanders’s victory in the 2016 New Hampshire primary was instrumental in launching his presidential campaign, and both Yang and Gabbard hope to follow in his footsteps.
Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur and founder of Venture for America, has a strong track record in appealing to Sanders’s supporters. Yang’s progressive policies, most notably his proposal for a universal basic income, have resonated with Sanders’s base. Yang has also been highly visible on social media platforms, where he has gained a large following.
Tulsi Gabbard, a veteran and Hawaii congresswoman, has also garnered support from Sanders’s voters. Gabbard’s campaign has emphasized her anti-interventionist foreign policy, which is aligned with Sanders’s stance on the issue. Gabbard has also spoken out against what she sees as the Democratic Party’s favoritism towards certain candidates, positioning herself as a candidate who is unafraid to challenge the party establishment.
Despite their similarities in their appeal to Sanders’s supporters, Yang and Gabbard have taken distinct approaches to campaigning in New Hampshire. Yang has focused heavily on boosting his visibility in the state, hosting town hall meetings, and participating in local events. Gabbard, on the other hand, has conducted a more grassroots campaign, relying on door-to-door canvassing and small-scale events.
In recent polls, both Yang and Gabbard have polled in the single digits in New Hampshire, but their campaigns show no signs of slowing down. With the primary fast approaching, both candidates are hoping to build momentum and pick up crucial support from voters who previously backed Bernie Sanders.
The competition for Sanders’s voters in New Hampshire underscores the larger challenge facing Democratic candidates in the primary race. With such a large and diverse field of contenders, candidates will need to find a way to stand out and appeal to voters who have disparate views on key issues. For Yang and Gabbard, the road ahead is uncertain, but their campaigns are a testament to the enduring influence of Bernie Sanders on Democratic politics.
