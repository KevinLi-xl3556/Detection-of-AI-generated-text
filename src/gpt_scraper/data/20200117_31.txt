On January 17th, 1964, Michelle Obama was born in Chicago, Illinois. Over 50 years later, on her birthday, President Donald Trump decided to take aim at one of her most notable accomplishments: the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.
The act, which was championed by Obama during her time as First Lady, established school nutrition guidelines that aimed to provide healthier options for students. Trump’s new proposal, announced on January 17th, 2020, would roll back these guidelines and allow for more flexibility in what schools can serve.
This move has sparked controversy and criticism from those who believe that the nutrition guidelines were making a positive impact on the health of students across the country.
But why is Trump targeting Michelle Obama’s school nutrition guidelines?
Some believe that it’s a personal vendetta against the former First Lady. Trump has a history of attacking Obama, calling into question her husband’s birthplace and citizenship and even criticizing her appearance. This move to undo her signature initiative could be seen as yet another attack on the Obama legacy.
Others believe that it’s simply a matter of politics. Trump is catering to his supporters, many of whom have expressed frustration with the nutrition guidelines. Some have even called it an example of government overreach, arguing that schools should have the freedom to decide what they serve.
Regardless of the motivation, the move to roll back the nutrition guidelines is concerning to many. According to a study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, children who eat school meals that meet the nutrition guidelines are more likely to consume fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and less likely to have high levels of unhealthy fats and added sugars in their diets.
This has led to concerns that the new proposal will result in a decline in the health of students across the country. Critics have also pointed out that the new proposal would allow for more processed foods and fewer fruits and vegetables, potentially leading to long-term health problems like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.
Overall, Trump’s decision to target Michelle Obama’s school nutrition guidelines on her birthday has sparked debate and concern from both sides of the political spectrum. Only time will tell what impact this proposal will have on the health and well-being of America’s students.
