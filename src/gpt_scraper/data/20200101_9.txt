David Stern, the former commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), passed away on January 1, 2020, at the age of 77. Stern had been the league’s commissioner for 30 years, from 1984 to 2014, during which time he transformed the NBA into a global sports powerhouse.
Stern’s tenure as commissioner was marked by a series of groundbreaking initiatives that revolutionized the league. He was a visionary who understood the importance of television and media in building a sports brand, and he worked tirelessly to expand the NBA’s reach across the globe.
Under Stern’s leadership, the NBA became the first major professional sports league to embrace digital media, with the launch of NBA.com in 1995. He also led the charge in expanding the league’s presence on television, negotiating billion-dollar deals with networks like ESPN and TNT that helped turn the NBA into a household name.
But Stern’s impact on the NBA went far beyond media and technology. He was a fierce advocate for player rights and helped usher in a new era of professionalism in the league. Stern was instrumental in establishing the NBA’s drug testing policy, which helped combat substance abuse among players, and he also introduced a salary cap system that helped create a more level playing field for small-market teams.
Perhaps most importantly, Stern was a champion of diversity and inclusion in the NBA. He was instrumental in helping to create the league’s first collective bargaining agreement that included a minimum age for players, which helped ensure that young athletes were not exploited by agents or teams.
Stern was also a staunch supporter of women’s basketball, helping to launch the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) in 1997. He believed that women’s basketball had tremendous potential and worked tirelessly to ensure that the league had the resources it needed to thrive.
Stern’s influence on the NBA was immeasurable, and his legacy will continue to be felt for generations to come. He was a transformative figure who helped bring the NBA into the modern era, and his impact on the sport and the business of sports will never be forgotten.
In a statement following Stern’s passing, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “David took over the NBA at a time when it was struggling. But through his leadership, vision, and creativity, he built it into the global force that it is today. His legacy will always be felt by players, coaches, fans, and everyone who loves the game of basketball.”
The NBA community, and indeed the entire sports world, mourns the loss of David Stern. He was a true visionary, a tireless advocate for his sport, and a beloved leader who will be sorely missed.
