The ongoing conflict between the United States and Iran has been a source of tension for years, but the recent escalation of hostilities threatens to undermine one of the key goals of both nations: the fight against ISIS.
ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has been a major global threat since its inception in 2014. The group has committed countless atrocities, including beheadings, bombings, and other acts of violence, in its quest for control of territory in the Middle East and beyond. While ISIS has been weakened in recent years by a concerted international effort to combat its activities, the group remains a formidable force, with thousands of fighters still active in Iraq and Syria.
The fight against ISIS has been a rare point of cooperation between the United States and Iran. While the two nations have been at odds over a wide range of issues, including Iranâ€™s nuclear program, they have both recognized the danger posed by ISIS and have worked together, albeit indirectly, to combat the group. Iran has provided military support to the Iraqi government in its fight against ISIS, while the United States has led a coalition of countries in airstrikes against ISIS targets.
However, the recent escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran threatens to undermine this fragile cooperation. In January 2020, the United States assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a high-ranking Iranian military commander, in a drone strike in Iraq. Iran responded by launching missile strikes against U.S. military bases in Iraq, and the two nations appeared on the brink of all-out war.
While both sides eventually backed down from further military action, the fallout from the Soleimani assassination continues to be felt. Iran has vowed to retaliate against the United States, and tensions remain high in the region. This makes it difficult for the two nations to continue their cooperation against ISIS, as any misstep or misunderstanding could lead to a wider conflict.
Furthermore, the Soleimani assassination has emboldened hardliners in Iran who are opposed to any cooperation with the United States. These individuals view the United States as an enemy and believe that any cooperation with the nation is tantamount to surrender. As a result, they are likely to resist any efforts to work with the United States in the fight against ISIS.
The conflict with Iran also threatens to distract the United States from its efforts against ISIS. With tensions high in the region, the United States may be forced to divert resources and attention away from the fight against ISIS and toward preparing for a potential conflict with Iran. This could allow ISIS to regroup and regain strength, undoing years of progress in the fight against the group.
In conclusion, the ongoing conflict between the United States and Iran threatens to undermine one of the key goals of both nations: the fight against ISIS. Cooperation between the two nations has been essential in the fight against the group, but the recent escalation of tensions makes it difficult to continue this cooperation. The United States must find a way to de-escalate the conflict with Iran and focus its attention on the fight against ISIS before it is too late. Failure to do so could have disastrous consequences for the region and the world as a whole.
