A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has revealed that the Trump Administration broke the law by withholding military aid to Ukraine last year. The move, which was part of an alleged scheme to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, has been at the center of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump.
The GAO report, which was released on Thursday, concludes that the Trump Administration violated the Impoundment Control Act, a law that requires the President to give Congress advance notice if he wishes to withhold funds that have been appropriated by Congress. The report states that the Administration’s actions in withholding the aid were “not permitted” under the Act.
The report is the latest blow to the President’s defense, as he faces impeachment charges in the Senate. Since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, Trump has attempted to downplay the significance of the actions of his Administration, arguing that he was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and that he was not engaging in any wrongdoing.
However, the GAO report undermines this defense by rendering a clear verdict that the Administration broke the law. The report also notes that even after the Administration became aware that the withholding of the aid was under investigation, the funds were not released until September 11th.
The findings of the GAO report are likely to increase pressure on the Senate to conduct a full and impartial trial of the President, with Democrats arguing that the report makes it clear that Trump’s actions were not simply a matter of policy differences, but were a threat to the rule of law.
In response to the report, the White House has insisted that the Administration acted within its rights and that the aid was eventually delivered to Ukraine. However, the GAO report makes it clear that the Administration’s actions created a “violation of the law” and raises serious questions about the President’s conduct.
In conclusion, the GAO report represents a significant development in the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump. The report provides clear and persuasive evidence that the President’s actions were not only ethically questionable, but also illegal. As the impeachment trial moves forward, it will be interesting to see how the Senate responds to this damning report, and whether it will hold the President accountable for his actions.
