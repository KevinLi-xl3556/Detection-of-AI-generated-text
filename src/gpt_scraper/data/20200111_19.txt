On the morning of January 7th, 2020, Puerto Rico was hit by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake, causing severe damage to buildings and infrastructure across the island. This comes as a devastating blow to the people of Puerto Rico, who are still recovering from a series of earthquakes that began in late December 2019, with numerous aftershocks and tremors continuing to rock the region.
The latest earthquake comes as a shock to the island, with many Puerto Ricans expressing their fear and despair on social media platforms, with many posting pictures and videos of the damage caused to their homes, workplaces, and communities. The tremors were felt across the entire island, with the hardest-hit areas being in the southern region, including the city of Ponce.
The earthquake has already caused extensive damage, with many buildings collapsing and a number of people being injured. The island’s power grid has been severely affected, with power outages and disruptions being reported in various areas. The island’s only power plant has also been shut down as a result of the earthquake, leading to an island-wide power outage.
In the wake of the disaster, many Puerto Ricans are feeling overwhelmed and frightened. Yamily Santiago, a resident of Ponce, told reporters, “It’s just too much. We’ve barely had time to recover from the last quakes, and now this. It’s really scary, and we don’t know when it’s going to end.”
The government of Puerto Rico has already declared a state of emergency, with Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced urging residents to remain calm and stay safe. She has also called on the US government to declare a major disaster, citing the extensive damage caused by the earthquake.
Many relief organizations are already on the ground in Puerto Rico, providing aid and support to those affected by the quake. Organizations such as the Red Cross and UNICEF are working with local authorities to provide shelter, food, and medical care to those in need.
However, the road to recovery for Puerto Rico is likely to be a long and difficult one. The island has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including Hurricane Maria in 2017, which caused widespread damage and devastation, and a debt crisis that has had long-lasting effects on the island’s economy and infrastructure.
Despite these challenges, the people of Puerto Rico remain resilient and determined to rebuild and recover. As Governor Vázquez Garced said in a recent statement, “We are a strong and united people, and we will overcome this. We will come out of this stronger and more resilient than ever before.”
In the meantime, the people of Puerto Rico are relying on each other for support and comfort, sharing their stories on social media and coming together as a community. While the situation is still uncertain and potentially dangerous, the people of Puerto Rico are putting their trust in the strength and resilience of their fellow citizens, and in the hope of a brighter future.
