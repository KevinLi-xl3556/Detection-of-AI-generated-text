In a shocking turn of events, a member of the prominent Kennedy family has thrown their hat into the race for New Jersey’s 2nd Congressional district. Amy Kennedy, who is married to former Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, is running as a Democrat against the incumbent Republican, Jeff Van Drew.
Van Drew made headlines last year when he switched parties to become a Republican after voting against impeachment articles against President Trump. His defection has faced backlash from many voters in the district, leading to a crowded field of Democratic challengers.
Amy Kennedy, a former teacher and mental health advocate, has been bolstered by her family’s political legacy and her experience on key education and mental health issues. In an interview, she said addressing the opioid crisis, supporting small businesses, and healthcare were the key issues that pushed her to run.
The Kennedy family has a rich history in American politics, including President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert and Ted Kennedy, who championed progressive causes during their respective tenures in the Senate. Amy Kennedy is hoping to continue that legacy in New Jersey.
If elected, Kennedy would join a growing number of women in Congress and help bring balance to a historically male-dominated institution. As the mother of five children, she has said that she would be a strong advocate for protecting children’s health and welfare.
This race is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched and hotly contested in the upcoming election cycle. With the nation grappling with a pandemic, civil unrest, and economic uncertainty, voters in New Jersey’s 2nd district will have a lot to consider come November.
