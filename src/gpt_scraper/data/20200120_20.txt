For 13 Years, He Has Humanized the Villain of ‘Oklahoma!’
When we think of the classic musical ‘Oklahoma!’, our minds typically go to the beloved songs and dances, the romance between the main characters, and the upbeat portrayal of life in the early 1900s in the American West. However, for actor John Smith, his role in the production has been vastly different than the rest of the cast. For the past 13 years, Smith has played the infamous villain of the show, Jud Fry, and has humanized the character in ways that have surprised and moved audiences.
For those who aren’t familiar with the plot of ‘Oklahoma!’, Jud Fry is essentially the antagonist of the story – a rugged and brooding farmhand who is infatuated with the leading lady, Laurey. Throughout the play, Jud becomes increasingly volatile and aggressive towards the other characters, culminating in a dramatic climax in which he is killed in a fight with the protagonist, Curly.
Traditionally, actors who portray Jud Fry lean heavily into the character’s intimidating and malicious traits, playing him as a one-dimensional villain. However, John Smith has taken a very different approach. Through his portrayal of Jud, Smith has sought to delve deeper into the character’s psyche, showing the audience the human side of a man who has often been depicted solely as a monster.
Smith’s interpretation of Jud Fry is nuanced and empathetic, revealing the complexity of a man who has been dealt a hard hand in life. Through his performance, Smith has highlighted Jud’s loneliness and desperation, showing how those emotions have led him to make bad decisions and act out in destructive ways. By showing the audience Jud’s humanity, Smith has created a character that is as tragic as he is menacing, leaving audiences with a new perspective on the show’s antagonist.
Over the years, Smith’s portrayal of Jud Fry has earned him critical acclaim, with many praising his ability to add depth and dimension to a character that has often been regarded as little more than a plot device. Smith’s approach to the role has given audiences a fuller and more nuanced understanding of the show’s themes and messages, proving that even the most unsympathetic of characters can be humanized and made relatable.
As the curtain closes on yet another performance of ‘Oklahoma!’, John Smith takes his final bows in the role of Jud Fry, having spent more than a decade bringing new life to one of musical theater’s most enduring villains. With his thoughtful and emotional interpretation of the character, Smith has proven that even in the world of black and white morality, there is always room for gray.
