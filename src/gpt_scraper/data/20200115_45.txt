Neanderthals Could Swim. They Even Dived.
For decades, it was commonly believed that Neanderthals were a primitive and unintelligent species that could barely survive in their harsh environment. However, recent archaeological discoveries and scientific research have revealed that they were much more advanced and adaptable than previously thought. In fact, evidence shows that Neanderthals were capable of swimming and diving, which suggests they had a sophisticated culture and a deeper understanding of their world than we might have imagined.
The idea that Neanderthals could swim is not entirely new, as there have been occasional reports of fossils found in aquatic habitats. However, the discovery of several sites in the Mediterranean that contain shells of marine animals, some of which bear clear tool marks, strongly suggests that Neanderthals not only swam but also dived to collect shellfish, which was an important part of their diet. Moreover, the discovery of a 40,000-year-old bone fragment from a modern human in a cave in Portugal points to the possibility that Neanderthals and modern humans were diving together to gather resources.
But how could Neanderthals manage to swim and dive, given their robust and muscular build? The answer lies in their physiology. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Madrid showed that the shape of their ribcage and pelvis was similar to that of modern humans who are proficient swimmers, indicating that Neanderthals had the ability to move efficiently in water. Additionally, the same study suggested that their larger lung volume and denser bones may have helped them to float more easily and to stay underwater for longer periods.
The fact that Neanderthals were able to swim and dive has significant implications for our understanding of their culture and lifestyle. It implies that they had knowledge of the coastal environments and had developed technologies to exploit these resources. This suggests that Neanderthals may have had complex social structures and were capable of exchanging information and knowledge about their environment among themselves over generations.
Moreover, the ability to dive for shellfish would have required considerable planning and coordination, indicating that Neanderthals had the cognitive capacity to undertake sophisticated activities. This also implies that they had a diverse and varied diet, which suggests they were not simply scavengers, but rather had a more complex and nuanced relationship with their environment.
While much is still unknown about the lives of Neanderthals, the discovery that they were able to swim and dive provides valuable insight into their culture and intelligence. It also highlights the limitations of our assumptions about extinct species and reminds us that our knowledge is constantly evolving. The more we learn about the past, the more we are able to appreciate the diversity and complexity of life on our planet.
