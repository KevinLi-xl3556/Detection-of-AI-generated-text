In a surprising turn of events, former housing secretary Julián Castro announced his endorsement for Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren for president on Monday.
Castro, who recently dropped out of the presidential race himself, made his announcement while speaking at a rally in Brooklyn, New York, on behalf of Warren’s campaign. He praised Warren’s dedication towards fighting for working families and her comprehensive plans to reform healthcare and education.
“Today, I am proud to endorse Elizabeth Warren for president,” Castro told the crowd. “There is no one who works harder, there is no one who is more committed to fighting for people’s futures.”
Castro’s endorsement is a significant boost for Warren, who has been lagging behind in recent presidential polls. Warren has been vocal in her support of Castro’s policies, including his call for decriminalization of illegal border crossings.
The Texas native, who served as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration, also praised Warren’s policy proposals on curbing gun violence, addressing climate change, and protecting women’s reproductive rights.
Warren, in turn, thanked Castro for his endorsement and pledged to work together to secure a future for all Americans.
“I am so grateful to Julián Castro for his endorsement and for celebrating the work we have done to create real, tangible change for working families,” Warren tweeted.
Castro’s endorsement comes as a surprise to many political observers who expected him to endorse fellow Texan, former Vice President Joe Biden. However, it may signal a shift in Democratic party politics with an increasing focus on progressive policies and grassroots activism.
Warren’s campaign, which has faced criticism for its lack of diversity, welcomed Castro’s endorsement in a statement.
“We are thrilled to have Julián Castro’s endorsement,” the statement read. “Together, we will build a grassroots movement for big, structural change in America.”
The endorsement is likely to help Warren’s campaign gain momentum heading into the crucial Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 and the upcoming primaries in New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. With Castro’s support, she may be able to continue to build a coalition of progressive voters and establish herself as a viable alternative to frontrunners Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
As the presidential race heats up, Warren’s campaign looks to be gaining steam. With the endorsement from Julián Castro, she has the support of a rising star in Democratic politics and a dedicated advocate for working families.
