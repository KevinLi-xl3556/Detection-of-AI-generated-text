In a surprising turn of events, a recent poll in Iowa shows a neck-and-neck race between the two leading presidential candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden has jumped ahead of President Donald Trump, but the numbers show a tight race that could easily swing in either candidate’s direction.
The poll, conducted by the Des Moines Register and Mediacom Iowa Poll, shows Biden with a narrow lead over Trump. Biden received the support of 48% of likely voters, while Trump received 45%. The remaining 7% are undecided or supporting a third-party candidate.
This new poll is significant because Iowa is seen as a bellwether state in presidential elections. The last time Iowa voted for a Republican presidential candidate was in 2004, and since then, it has voted for the Democratic candidate in every election.
Biden’s newfound lead is likely due to his recent campaigning efforts in the state. He has made several visits to Iowa, including a virtual town hall with Des Moines Register, where he answered questions from Iowans about his plans for the country.
Additionally, Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to his declining support in Iowa. As cases continue to rise in the state, more Iowans are becoming frustrated with the president’s response to the crisis.
However, Trump still maintains significant support in rural areas and among conservative voters. He has also been endorsed by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who praised his leadership during the pandemic.
The race in Iowa is shaping up to be a crucial one for both candidates. A win for Biden would give him a significant boost heading into November, while a win for Trump would solidify his support in a state that has only voted Republican once in the past two decades.
As Election Day draws closer, both candidates will be ramping up their campaigning efforts in Iowa and across the country. With a tight race in the Hawkeye State, every vote will count, and the outcome could have significant implications for the future of American democracy.
