Spike Lee, the legendary director behind such classic films as “Do The Right Thing” and “Malcolm X,” has been chosen to head the jury of the Cannes Film Festival. The news was announced on Tuesday by festival officials, who praised Lee for his “uncompromising vision” and “unparalleled talent.”
Lee is no stranger to Cannes, having premiered several of his films at the festival over the years, including “BlackKkKlansman,” which won the prestigious Grand Prix award in 2018. He has also been a vocal advocate for diverse voices in cinema, and his appointment as jury head is seen as a reflection of Cannes’ ongoing commitment to inclusion and pushing boundaries in filmmaking.
“I’m honored to be the first person of the African diaspora to be named president of the Cannes jury and of a main film festival,” Lee said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to being immersed in the work of fellow filmmakers from all over the planet.”
Lee’s selection comes at a time when the film industry as a whole is grappling with issues of representation and diversity. The Cannes Festival has been working to address these concerns in recent years, including a pledge to achieve gender parity among its board by 2020.
The festival has also faced criticism in the past for its lack of recognition of female filmmakers and filmmakers of color. In 2018, only three out of 21 films competing for the Palme d’Or were directed by women.
Lee’s appointment is seen as a positive step towards increasing visibility for underrepresented voices in cinema. As jury head, he will have the opportunity to champion the work of filmmakers from diverse backgrounds and bring attention to stories and perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked.
The Cannes Film Festival is one of the most prestigious festivals in the world, and Lee’s presidency is sure to bring added attention to this year’s event. With his outspoken voice on social and political issues, as well as his formidable filmmaking talent, he is sure to make a lasting impact as jury head and help steer Cannes into the future.
