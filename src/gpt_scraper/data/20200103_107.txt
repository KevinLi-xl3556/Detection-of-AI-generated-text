Office Treats Bring Out the Worst of Humanity
In most offices around the world, there’s a tradition that’s both loved and loathed by many: office treats. Whether it’s someone’s birthday, a promotion, or just a random act of kindness, office treats are meant to bring a little joy and camaraderie to the workplace. However, as innocent as they may seem, office treats can often bring out the worst of humanity, revealing some of the less desirable behaviors and tendencies that lurk beneath the surface in a professional setting.
One of the most glaring issues with office treats is the phenomenon of food-related greed. As soon as the announcement of free treats hits the office airwaves, it’s not uncommon to see a stampede of employees rushing to the communal kitchen or break room, elbows flying, eyes darting, and forks at the ready. Suddenly, the normally friendly and cooperative colleagues transform into ravenous beasts, jostling and pushing their way to the front of the line to get the biggest slice of cake, the most chocolate chip cookies, or the freshest donuts. It’s a display of gluttony and selfishness that can leave a sour taste in the mouths of those who miss out or are left with the crumbs of what’s left.
Office treats can also exacerbate existing tensions and create an unhealthy sense of entitlement among employees. In some workplaces, there may be a select few who always seem to be the first in line for office treats, and others who are consistently left empty-handed. This can lead to feelings of favoritism, resentment, and unfairness, which can poison the office atmosphere and erode team morale. The sense of entitlement that can arise from always being on the receiving end of office treats can also foster a toxic “me-first” attitude, where employees become less willing to collaborate or help their colleagues, viewing any office treat as a personal entitlement rather than a gesture of goodwill for the entire team.
Another unfortunate side effect of office treats is the waste they can generate. Often, office treats come in the form of sugary snacks, baked goods, or other indulgent treats that are high in calories and low in nutritional value. This can contribute to unhealthy eating habits among employees, leading to weight gain, decreased productivity, and even health issues such as diabetes or heart disease. Moreover, the excessive packaging and disposable plates, cups, and utensils used for office treats can generate unnecessary waste and contribute to environmental pollution, adding to the negative impact of office treats on both personal and planetary health.
In addition to the physical and emotional impact, office treats can also create a culture of obligation and pressure. Some employees may feel compelled to participate in office treats out of fear of being seen as rude or ungrateful if they decline. This can put pressure on employees to indulge in treats they may not want or need, leading to feelings of guilt or discomfort. Office treats can also create an expectation of reciprocity, where employees feel obligated to bring treats for their colleagues on their own special occasions or promotions. This can create a sense of competition or obligation, adding an additional layer of stress to an already busy work environment.
So, what can be done to address the darker side of office treats? Here are some suggestions:


Encourage healthier options: Instead of sugary snacks and treats, consider offering healthier alternatives such as fresh fruit, vegetable platters, or nuts. This can promote better eating habits among employees and contribute to a healthier workplace culture.


Rotate treat responsibilities: Avoid creating a culture of obligation by rotating the responsibility of bringing treats among employees, rather than relying on a select few to always provide. This can prevent feelings of entitlement and reduce the pressure on individuals to participate.


Be mindful of food allergies and dietary restrictions: Take into consideration the diverse
