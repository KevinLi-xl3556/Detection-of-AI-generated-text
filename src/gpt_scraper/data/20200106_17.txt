The assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, by the US government in January 2020, was one of the most severe blows to Iranian power in the Middle East in recent history. The general was killed in a drone strike near Baghdad airport, sparking outrage in Iran and across the region. But what led to the killing of Suleimani, and why was he such a significant target for the United States?
Suleimani was a major figure in the Islamic Republic’s security apparatus and its most important military strategist. He was responsible for coordinating Iran’s military campaigns and for building pro-Iranian paramilitary groups that extended Iran’s influence in the Middle East. Suleimani was also involved in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, where his forces played a crucial role in pushing back ISIS forces.
The relationship between the United States and Iran has been rocky ever since Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979. The United States has accused Iran of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region, while Iran has accused the United States of interfering in its internal affairs and using economic sanctions to undermine its economy.
The killing of Suleimani came after months of escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, which reached a boiling point when Iran-backed militias attacked the US embassy in Baghdad on December 31, 2019. The embassy attack led to a US military strike on Shia militia bases in Iraq, which in turn led to the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed militias.
The United States responded to the embassy attack by killing Suleimani, citing him as a “terrorist mastermind” and claiming that the strike was a defensive measure aimed at preventing future attacks on US personnel and interests in the region. Iran, however, viewed the killing as an act of aggression and a violation of its sovereignty.
The aftermath of the assassination saw a dangerous escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran, with Iran launching missile strikes on US bases in Iraq and threatening further reprisals. The situation culminated in the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in Tehran, which Iran claimed was a result of human error.
The killing of Suleimani was a significant moment in the ongoing conflict between the United States and Iran. The assassination removed a key figure in Iran’s military and security apparatus, dealing a blow to the country’s regional ambitions. However, it also provoked outrage in Iran and demonstrated the continuing dysfunction in the two countries’ relationship. The killing of Suleimani will likely reverberate in the region for years to come, as Iran seeks to reassert its power and the United States attempts to maintain its influence.
