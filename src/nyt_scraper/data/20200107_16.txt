Do You Have Living Relatives Who Lived Through World War II? Help Us Tell Their Story
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II. Throughout 2020, At War will be commemorating this historic event and its effects on the course of world history, with a variety of coverage, including accounts from people who lived through the war, but did not serve in the military: Holocaust survivors, people who joined underground antiwar movements, women who joined the stateside work force, Japanese-Americans forced into internment camps and others.
If you or a family member lived through the war — anywhere in the world — and want to tell us the story of its effect on your life, let us know via the form below. Share details of your experience, and include contact information so The Times can follow up with you. (And if you or someone you know served in the military during World War II, share your story here.)
