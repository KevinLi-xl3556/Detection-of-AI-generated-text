4 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend
Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
‘BEYOND BABEL’ at the Gym at Judson (Jan. 21, 7 p.m.; Jan. 23, 8 p.m.; through March 25). The married choreographers and performers Keone and Mari Madrid are popular ambassadors of a style they call narrative urban dance, which uses hip-hop moves to tell stories about relationships, personal and social. Their work has been shown mostly in snippets online and on television, like a Justin Bieber music video and NBC’s competition “World of Dance.” Now they arrive in New York with a crew of remarkable dancers and this evening-length production about how walls — external and internal — threaten us. The unusually long 10-week stint follows a successful run in San Diego, where audiences embraced the couple’s mix of impressive popping and locking with heartfelt emotion.
