A Venetian Aperitif Fit for a Spritz
Aperitif liqueurs, both imported and domestic, continue to gain in popularity. Select, an example from Venice that’s been around for 100 years, hit the American market late last summer, and, with its ruby color, suits a Valentine toast. The blend of botanicals includes a good dose of juniper and was created by the brothers Mario and Vittorio Pilla. It’s a touch mellower than some of its competitors and is a key ingredient in the spritz, made like most with three parts Prosecco, two of Select and a spray of soda water, but distinguished in Venice by the addition of a big fat green olive.
