Nonalcoholic Cocktails’ Most Unexpected Fans: Kids
Perhaps no one had more disdain for the Shirley Temple than the person for whom the kid-friendly cocktail was named. “Those saccharine, icky drinks? I had nothing to do with [them],” the actress told NPR’s Scott Simon in the 1980s. If only she could have gone to the restaurant Fishnet in Baltimore, where the Not So Shirley Temple is balanced with savory baking spices. Around the country, restaurants are expanding their menus of thoughtful, complex, nonalcoholic cocktails to keep pace — especially this month — with a population that’s drinking less. And while these drinks are made for adult palates, they’re also drawing an unexpected fan base: children.
At the airy all-day cafe Hunky Dory, in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, owner Claire Sprouse created the Pink Kong, a $9 nonalcoholic cocktail of rice milk, pink peppercorn tea and the cardamom-forward Seedlip Spice 94, for abstaining adults. Yet, kids “suck it down,” Sprouse says. “There’s nothing stranger than having to cut off a child before they rack up a huge tab.” At Yugen in Chicago, a 4-year-old recently sipped through the entire spirit-free cocktail pairing that’s offered with the multicourse Japanese meal. In Indianapolis, young patrons at Gallery Pastry Shop are ordering lavender-pear lemonade, served in Champagne flutes. “These kids have sophisticated palates,” says co-owner Alison Keefer. They embrace spice, understand balance and love to learn about ingredients they’ve never tried before.
