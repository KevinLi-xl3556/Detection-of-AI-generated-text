Hillary Clinton’s Swipe at Bernie Sanders
To the Editor:
Re “‘Nobody Likes Him’: Clinton’s Shot at Sanders Rattles Democrats” (front page, Jan. 22):
I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and am undecided as to which Democratic Party candidate I will support in 2020. However, I find Mrs. Clinton’s comments about Senator Bernie Sanders to be meanspirited and divisive.
Nobody likes him? Millions of people supported his campaign in 2016 and are doing so again in 2020. Furthermore, Mr. Sanders supported and campaigned for Mrs. Clinton after she won the nomination. What a bizarre way to repay that support.
Mrs. Clinton would do well to make fewer public comments during this campaign, and when she must comment, she should think before she speaks. We must work for party unity and keep our eyes on the prize — defeating President Trump. Personal attacks against a leading Democratic candidate will only increase Mr. Trump’s chances of winning re-election.
