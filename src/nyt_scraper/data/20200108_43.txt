Fran Drescher Developing ‘The Nanny’ Musical for Broadway
Fran Drescher, the creator and star of one of the most beloved sitcoms of the ’90s, is developing “The Nanny” into a musical bound for Broadway, the production announced on Wednesday.
The TV show aired for six seasons, from 1993-1999. The nanny — Fran Fine, an over-the-top Queens native who arrives on the doorstep of a Manhattan family that happens to be looking for help — was partly based on Drescher’s own Queens upbringing.
The team behind the CW musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” will be crafting the show’s score. Rachel Bloom, who created and stars in the CW series, will write the music and lyrics for stage with Adam Schlesinger, the show’s executive music producer. The pair won an Emmy Award last year for outstanding original music and lyrics on the show.
Though more and more films are being adapted to the stage, TV series rarely get the same treatment.  “The Nanny” would join a slim list that includes “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical,” which opened in 2017, and “The Addams Family” from 2010.
Drescher will write the book with Peter Marc Jacobson, who created and wrote the show with Drescher, who was his wife at the time. The cast has not been decided yet, the show said, but Drescher will not be reprising her role.
Scott and Brian Zeilinger, the father-son producing duo whose shows include “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Mean Girls," are also signed on. Marc Bruni (“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical”) will direct.
The show has not yet announced a production schedule.
