Pet Keepsakes
After your pet dies, you can have it turned into any manner of mementos — diamonds, tattoo ink, a locket to wear around your neck.
Theresa Furrer of Nine Lives Twine spins the hair of cats and dogs into yarn and woven keepsakes.
Would you like to have any of your pets commemorated in this way? Would you like a job like Ms. Furrer’s, creating something precious for people to remember their furry friends by?
