Blood Pressure Patterns Are Different for Women
Blood pressure begins to increase at younger ages in women than in men, and it goes up at a faster rate, a new study reports.
On average, women who develop heart disease are about 10 years older than men who develop it. But this report, published in JAMA cardiology, suggests that high blood pressure, one of the most important controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, begins at a younger age in women than men, and rises faster. The physiological processes that lead to heart disease, the findings suggest, may start earlier in women than in men.
