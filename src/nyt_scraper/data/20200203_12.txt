A Jerky Made of Salmon
Acme Smoked Fish, a family-owned company that has been curing fish in Brooklyn since the early 1900s, has something new to offer: salmon that’s treated with brown sugar and hot-smoked for what the company is calling smoked salmon candy. It’s like jerky, only moister and sweeter. Use it as a topping for salads, serve pieces on a cheese board, or chop and mix it with yogurt for a spread.
