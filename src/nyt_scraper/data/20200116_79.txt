Message in a Bagel (Bill de Blasio’s)
To the Editor:
Re “‘BagelGate’ Serves Up a Full Platter of Tasty Puns After de Blasio’s Toasty Tweet” (news article, Jan. 16):
Thank you for giving us something to laugh about and chew over that isn’t partisan politics or anti-Trump rhetoric.
Maybe all political debates should start with the question to all participants: “What is your favorite bagel?” It would not only break the ice, but it would also tell us something personal about the person answering.
