Cuomo Inspired Hope …

Andrew Cuomo, New York’s Democratic governor, presents himself as a criminal justice reformer. He’s vowed to create “a more just, more fair and more compassionate New York.” Specifically, he signaled in 2015 that he wanted to begin granting clemency to more prisoners “deserving of a second chance.”
Clemency is a crucial part of criminal justice reform, because it can help minimize past wrongs. Tens of thousands of Americans, including an unknown number who are innocent, are locked up today because of cruelly long sentences.
Unfortunately, Cuomo’s actions on clemency haven’t come close to matching his words.
After he encouraged prisoners to apply to have their sentences ended or reduced, many of them did so. A single law school — at the City University of New York — received 1,800 requests to help with clemency applications, according to Steven Zeidman, a professor there. Cuomo has ignored or rejected almost all of them.
In recent years, he has granted fewer clemencies than many other governors, including Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican; John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, a Democrat; and Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat. After a review process at the end of last year, Cuomo ended or shortened only 11 sentences.
“This outcome is pathetic,” Rachel Barkow of New York University School of Law wrote, after the announcement. “It’s particularly disheartening to see Cuomo’s inaction when he tried to tout his clemency initiative as something significant.” (On this episode of the Justice in America podcast, Barkow talked about a president’s clemency powers.)
Many clemency decisions aren’t easy. And they often open a governor to criticism. But political leadership is supposed to be about making hard decisions for the greater good, especially when a leader has already promised to make them.
