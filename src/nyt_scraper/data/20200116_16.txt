What One Woman Packed and Another Woman Thought
To the Editor:
Reviewing Ed Stafford’s “Expeditions Unpacked: What the Great Explorers Took Into the Unknown” (Jan. 5), Tina Jordan passes along Stafford’s assertion that Nellie Bly, the journalist who raced Elizabeth Bisland around the world in 1889 and 1890, managed to pack both champagne and cold cream in her “tiny, purse-sized valise.”
In taking only a single bag for a trip that lasted nearly three months, Bly was attempting to give the lie to the timeworn notion that a woman could not travel without taking along several pieces of luggage.
