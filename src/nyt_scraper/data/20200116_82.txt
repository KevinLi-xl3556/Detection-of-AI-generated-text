Police Seek to Arrest Odell Beckham Jr. After Video Shows Backside Slap
The Louisiana authorities said Thursday that a judge had approved an arrest warrant for Odell Beckham Jr., a star wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, after he appeared to slap the buttocks of a security officer after college footballâ€™s national title game on Monday night.
A police spokeswoman in New Orleans, where Louisiana State defeated Clemson for the national championship, said Beckham had been accused of simple battery but that she could not release other details about the warrant. A court official said a copy of the warrant had not yet been made public.
