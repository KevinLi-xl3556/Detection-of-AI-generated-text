Dinner Theater California-Style
First, there was “Sideways” the novel, and then the Academy Award-winning film about a guy who takes a friend on a California wine tour to show that pinot noir is better than merlot. Now it will be onstage presented by the Peccadillo Theater Company and Close Quarter Productions. Called “Sideways the Experience,” it was adapted by Rex Pickett, the author of the book, and for some ticket-holders, the performance will include a food  and wine tasting (merlot included) by the caterer Mary Giuliani onstage before the show begins, as well as wines — selected and provided by Wine Access — to sip during the performance.
