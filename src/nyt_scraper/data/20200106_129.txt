Tom Hanks at the Golden Globes: Don’t Be Late
Tom Hanks has a cold.
“It’s the cold that is making this happen,” the actor said at the Golden Globes on Sunday night. “I swear to god, I’m not nearly this emotional at home.”
Hanks was — somewhat tearfully — accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, given by the Globes for lifetime achievement in film. He first choked up when thanking his wife, Rita Wilson, and his children, and again toward the end of his speech.
Hanks spent his acceptance offering advice to other actors: Movies are made shot by shot. At some point, he said, a director will come up to you and tell you that if you don’t do your job really well, there won’t be a movie.
And, above all else: Don’t be late.
“Showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie,” Hanks said. Someone with a radio in their ear shouldn’t have to bang on the door to your trailer, he added — you should already be ready.
Hanks is certainly qualified to give his input: He has won eight Golden Globes throughout his career, and he has been nominated at the awards 16 times. Hanks has won best actor in a motion picture four times at the Globes, for his roles in “Big,” “Philadelphia,” “Forrest Gump” and “Cast Away.”
Hanks was nominated again on Sunday in the best supporting actor category for “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” The actor filled some big shoes — or a big red cardigan, at least — in playing Fred Rogers, the beloved host of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” (The award instead went to Brad Pitt, for “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.”)
Some of the more memorable lines in film have come from Hanks, too: “Life was like a box of chocolates.” “Houston, we have a problem.” “There’s no crying in baseball.”
There may not be crying in baseball. Crying in lifetime achievement acceptance speeches, though, is certainly all right.
