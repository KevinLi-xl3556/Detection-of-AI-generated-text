Podcast Groups Aren’t Just About Podcasts
When news broke last week that Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, would be stepping aside from royal duties, fans of the celebrity-focused podcast “Who? Weekly” thrilled to discuss it: Where would they live? (Canada? California?) Would they get jobs? What did the queen think? Their ideas — and inside jokes — played out across several of the podcast’s Facebook fan groups.
Podcasts, as Jamie Lauren Keiles wrote last year in The New York Times Magazine, have given rise to fan universes once reserved for popular TV shows. And many of those fandoms live on Facebook. Groups for podcasts like “Crime Junkie” and “Shameless” have ballooned to tens of thousands of members, and in some cases more than 100,000. And those are just the primary fan pages.
