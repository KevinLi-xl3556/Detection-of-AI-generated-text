How to Be a Kinder Traveler
Much has been written about “hacks” when it comes to being a better traveler. Sure, snagging the best deals, efficiently navigating airports and other in-the-know tricks are important, but there’s a piece of travel that’s just as important: How to be kind. To me, that equals a better traveler.
This goes beyond patience and basic manners. A kinder traveler is more mindful, showing genuine interest in the people we interact with and respect for the places we want to preserve.
