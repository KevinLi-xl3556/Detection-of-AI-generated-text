What Students Are Saying About Improving School Lunch, ‘#Megxit’ and Emoji Fun.
In this week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked young people for suggestions on how they would improve school lunches, invited them to weigh in on the current situation with the British royal family, and issued a literary challenge involving emojis.
As always, we received a number of thoughtful responses. Before we dive in, let’s offer a warm welcome to new classes from Battle Ground Academy and Franklin, Tenn.
Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.

In “What if Children Ran the School Lunchroom?” Anahad O’Connor reported on FoodCorps, a nonprofit organization that connects children to healthy food in schools.
We asked students to tell us what they thought about FoodCorps, the lunches at their school and their cafeteria experience overall. Many shared suggestions for improving the quality of the food offered, as well as ideas for minimizing the amount of waste.
Although I can attest to how picky some of my peers may be, I believe that some schools do not provide meal plans that reflect the culture and tastes of students. I do think that a survey would work as long as students are advised to provide recommendations within the standards of a balanced diet. My high school upgraded its salad bar and deli options sometime around last year. I noticed that the main dishes were mostly the same. Now, instead of giving diverse options that nobody liked, the lunch ladies would serve the “fan favorite” meals every day. Having too much of anything is no good, which is why I would personally like to see this implemented in my school.

Diversity would be great in school lunches, like more ethnic food that has a strong foothold in the American cuisine. However, the problem with vegans and vegetarians is that unfortunately they make up a tiny population of people who eat lunch, and I would see a challenge for an entire system to adapt to the minority. Even though the whole system might not be able to adapt, that isn’t to say change is impossible. An option of a salad bar would be fantastic, with options being available to those who happen to be vegan or vegetarian. I agree that there needs to be more fruit and vegetables, but the problem is we are dealing with teenagers who couldn’t care less about eating healthy. The challenge is to make healthy food seem appealing to the junk food-filled mind of a teenager.

In school kids should be able to pick between a variety of foods, but currently they only give you a few foods. I also believe schools should give less food, it says in the article “kids receive half of their daily calories in school. I think kids are too limited on their lunch. They could also make healthier foods like make kids eat more vegetables. The school doesn’t serve the best food all the time but they do enough to help you help pretty well.
— Hamza Zaman, West Virginia
I do think it is better for students to “discover what they love to eat” instead of adults at their school “telling them what they should eat.” When I was in elementary school, I would see my friends grab an apple or some type of vegetable because it was mandatory. At the end of the period, they would throw it out because they didn’t even want it in the first place. I believe that if a child is forced to complete a task, they cannot decide for themselves and pick up those healthy habits in the end.
— Carla Luna, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
Although I rarely eat their lunch, many of my friends eat it everyday. I have noticed that there is always Pizza and fries. I believe that a menu like this is extremely unhealthy for us and puts us into a habit of eating it without realizing its unhealthy because we are presented with these limited options. Programs like these should interfere in all schools and reach especially young children so they are aware and used to the healthy aspects of eating. It’s our right to suggest and customize healthy options in the school’s lunch menu because we are the ones to eat.
— Ayesha Mozum, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
If other countries around the world can make beautiful looking meals for their students, America can most definitely do so too. If only we invested more in the well-being of children than two trillion in weaponry, a third of children wouldn’t be obese. I think what America needs to do is to start spending its money on organic foods over weapons. While redoing every single public school in the country is outrageous, bringing in fresher food options is more reasonable. An idea to start is having students send in recipes or the names of meals, then a polling process for the whole district using the main suggestions could be used to create a whole new menu. After the new menu, a good business can be in charge of making the food for the schools in the district. It’s a perfect solution to a seemingly impossible conundrum.
— Simone Cronier, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
Although we are in high school, my peers would rather go hungry than eat their vegetables and fruits. So much food and hard work are wasted as they selfishly throw them away. I think that the menu has to change to combat this wasteful eating, not the kids themselves. Like the article suggested, my friends would much rather eat soups made from vegetables rather than eating them plain. Chances are that they would at least try the soup just because it is new to the menu. Even though the soups would contain the vegetables that are usually thrown away, the students would not even know they are eating them. They would ultimately be being tricked into eating their vegetables, just like their parents did to them as a kid.
— Harrison Carter, Hoggard High School
Through electives I have taken as a high schooler, such as culinary arts, I can attest to the wonders that come with putting work and effort into creating something yourself to consequently value that creation much more. I used to be a very picky eater, however after giving myself the initiative to prepare food for myself in class, I very quickly was able to expand the amount of healthy foods I would genuinely enjoy eating. I think this same effect is occurring with the children participating in these food programs. They grow their own vegetables, are given choices in regards to how they eat these foods, and thus value these foods so much more than they would have if the adults had done all the work themselves.
— Omar V, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL
My biggest grievance with lunches isn’t the bad food, or the lack of choice, or even the smell. It’s the short lunches we’re stuck with now. A few years ago, the whole school had a ~45 minute lunch where you could get tutoring, go to clubs, eat, and hang out with friends, all in the same period. It was great. Fast forward 2 years, and we aren’t even allowed to eat outside during our 25-minute lunches. The cafeteria is always way too crowded, and the lines are insane. There is so much more I could do if lunch was just a little bit longer, or if the lines were just a little bit shorter.
— Ryder Klein, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
When I was in middle school we had about 20 minutes of lunch. It took about half that time to get through the lunch line. I remember my friends staying at our table and not going through the line to just sit, relax, and talk. Making sure there is enough time for kids to socialize and eat is very important. More kids will take the time to go through the lunch line and less food will get thrown out at the end of the day.
— Emily Vogt, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
If you look up school lunches around the world you would be amazed at how good the food looks. It looks like food I would order at a nice restaurant, not a cafeteria. Their lunches also have to be extremely cost friendly as well to afford feeding all the students the school may have. If other countries can have great lunches at great prices why can’t we? All it would take would be better training for the cafeterias, smarter ways to source high quality food, and have programs that get the kids involved with what they are eating which would increase consumption and decrease cost. I am no expert in business but that sounds like a very smart plan to me.
— Josh Gans, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC
I know that the lunch people who prepare our food try their best and they volunteer to sever us our meals, but I feel that the schools should be giving more money to the meals that they feed us. I love eating meals that come off the grills, when they vegetables are off the grill and they’re all warm, but when I look at what the lunch men and lady’s use all they use are ovens. I feel that if we want kids to have better meals is for more money to go to the lunches and what they use to make them.
— Ben Titus, Beverly MA
One good thing our school has done is that we have a “sharing table,” where people can put the extra food that they do not desire to eat. This saves from wastage, but in my opinion, you spend your own money on lunch, and now you are giving away the things you bought. In other words, you are paying to not eat. Additionally daunting is the fact that I observe, everyday, people who scrape entire meals into the trash can, mostly out of sheer laziness. It may be more effective to have students “discover what they love to eat” rather than adults “telling kids what they should eat” because teen brains are hard-wired to always go against a command, even though it may not necessarily be bad.
— Shiv, King of Prussia, PA
My school tries to be healthy but sometimes healthy food isn’t delicious food. My school also requires us to grab a fruit or juice for breakfast even if we don’t eat it. Though, we do have a system where if you don’t want something, you put it on a table not everyone follows it. Most of the time people just throw the food in the trash can while they are throwing their other food away. This could be easily fixed if the school ordered fast food but then it wouldn’t be a healthy option. It’s hard to make something kids like and have it be healthy without it being too expensive.

I am in Horticulture II right now, and I took Horticulture 1 last fall. We have gardens and greenhouses back behind the school and we grow vegetables in huge proportions. I believe this could be used to an advantage, if we take the great-tasting, homegrown vegetables and used them in the cafeteria rather than importing sludge that is only classified as a vegetable because of the color, the results would be substantial. Another problem is our short lunch periods. The lines are too long, the cafeteria is too small, and we are now being refused the right to even eat outside. Students don’t even have enough time to finish their food, which contributes to not only the nutrient problem, but also the excessive food waste.

On Jan. 8, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan, announced they would be “stepping back” from some of their roles and responsibilities as senior members of the royal family. The move sparked chatter across the globe, so we asked teenagers to chime in with their thoughts.
Whether they kept up with the royal family or not, most students had things to say, or at least said they understood why the world was so eager to discuss the story. We especially appreciated the way they thoughtfully conversed with each other in the comments section and we’ve highlighted three of those exchanges below.
I, a person with little to no interest in the royal family have noticed the absurd amount of backlash Meghan Markle has received for seemingly being herself. She is a new addition to the royal family yet the public treats her with disgrace instead of welcome. She’s criticized for minuscule things such as wearing an atypical style of dress or not properly facing the crowd during a public appearance. Her severe treatment boils down to her biracial background. As the above quote says, no matter how successful you are, you cannot escape racism in our society
— Jahna, Franklin, TN
I completely support Meghan and Harry’s decision to take a step back from the royal family and share their time with North America. The racism that Meghan has had to face is absurd and no one should be continually subjected to that. I recently read a BuzzFeed article that highlighted the differences in press coverage between when Meghan and Kate when they did the same thing. One of the differences, in articles covering baby bumps, was especially astounding. For Kate, the Daily Mail wrote, “Bumping along nicely! The Duchess was seen placing a protective hand on her tummy as she exited the event.” For Meghan, they wrote, “Why can’t Meghan Markle keep her hands off her bump? Experts tackle the question that has gotten the nation talking: Is it pride, vanity, acting- or a new age bonding technique?” The aggression seen in the article about Meghan shows only a small portion of that disdain she has received from the British media.
— Cooper Hyldahl, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
The majority of conversations around the controversy and negative comments are directed at Meghan Markle, not Prince Harry. She’s a new addition to the royal family and people love to criticize change. When Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, she brought on new change and progression in the royal family; she was a celebrity, formerly divorced, and in the entertainment industry. Everyone makes important decisions; however, the difference is Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s choices are on display for the world to judge. The controversy around this topic is just another example of toxic celebrity obsession. Who cares that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wish to lead more private lives. People are quick to forget that their perception of celebrities is what the media has formed. The majority of people don’t know or have never met Meghan Markle; therefore, it’s impossible to know the full story. It’s frustrating to know that this “controversy” has been prioritized in the news. There are more pressing and relevant matters to be covered than a famous family seeking privacy.
— Dalia Diab, Battle Ground Academy
I do agree with the “Black Britians” and their statement. As a biracial person and person of color, I have experienced racist remarks being made about or around me. They’re not necessarily all “intended” but they are still “jokes” said to personally attack a certain race. Whether it’s in a school setting, sports game, or just hanging out on vacation, there will still be judgment being made on or about others. People like this do not care if your “status” is high or even if you’re a nice person, they’ll still try to find a way to bring you down. Most people do this just so they feel better about themselves.
— Reynah Rattliff, Julia R. Masterman
I think for anyone to blame the Duchess for any of this is ridiculous, because Prince Harry is making the decision himself to step down from his role because he supports his wife, and does not wish to support the institution that has brought controversy and backlash to the two of them ever since their marriage. He is supporting and defending his wife, and clearly wishes to be treated like a normal person, and to be given those expectations. The idea that the Duke and Duchess have to conform to the public ideal’s image of the royal family, is a high standard that no person should have to deal with in their lives, because we are all just humans, and we should all be treated the same, with the same societal expectations, regardless of what family they were born into.
— Jose Pagan, Providence
I think it’s ridiculous that Harry and Meghan are completely forsaking their duties to “earn an income” or “handle media.” It’s essential for the leaders to stay with the people, and a trip could be endangering the country. Prince Harry being sixth in line, the two of them aren’t incredibly important and it is unlikely they’ll be needed, but I don’t think they should be leaving for no good reason like this. I think that if they need to take a break or don’t want to do it, then Meghan shouldn’t have married Harry.
— Jason Zhang, Masterman
On a human level, I completely understand their decision to step back. It makes sense that they wanted more privacy, it must be incredibly difficult to never be out of the public’s eye in every aspect of your life. I can’t imagine even attempting to raise a family with thousands of people watching you. But, on an official level, this must be very disruptive for the royals. Them moving to Canada and wishing to live a more normal life must be a security nightmare for everyone involved. I consider it to be a bit selfish of them to only think about themselves when so many people will be affected by their decision.
— Lily Sussman, J.R. Masterman
I believe that the Duke and Duchess should be able to step back for their royal duties. They are constantly pressured to look royal, and don’t have a lot of privacy. People should look at them like normal people, not as something extraordinary. As normal people, sometimes we feel stressed, and must take a break from what we are doing. Spending time in both England and North America is a good way to relax away from the media in Britain constantly nagging them. I think they decided to spend time in North America, because that is where Meghan is from.
Privacy is a right that everyone should have. Having privacy is something that you can choose to do, and not be criticized for. No matter who you are, privacy is something you can choose to have.
— Avi Oza, Montgomery, New Jersey
Our generation is all about breaking tradition and standing up for yourself. Since both Meghan and Harry are public figures they have an impact on many children around the world. They are role models to many and I believe that they are teaching kids that they can be independent and that they can do anything even if someone tells them it’s impossible. It also teaches them that they don’t have to follow what society tells them to do, that they can be their own person.
Some things that are important to the couple, such as privacy and starting their own financially stable lives, may have pushed them to make this decision. I love the news of this decision because it is finally a positive headline that makes me feel like I can have the power to stand up for myself and my decisions. (Which is something I love to remind others of.)
— Sophia Caparelli, Hoggard Highschool in Wilmington, NC
After reading the article, I genuinely don’t understand why people are upset. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may be royals in the eyes of British citizens, but at the bottom of it all, they’re just two people who should be allowed to decide what to do with their own lives. For a man who has lost his mother and now has to stand by his wife, who’s constantly attacked by critics, not having his family support him starting over somewhere else and making his own living is unacceptable. Besides, he doesn’t even want to be king, so his decision is completely understandable.
Someone’s grandmother should not control their actions. It’s perplexing that they’ve lived like this for years. Just because Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen doesn’t mean that she should be able to decide how someone lives their life.
— Simone Cronier, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
I don’t care about the British Royal family all too much. I only really care about the people in the direct line of succession (Charles, William, and George). Megan Markle is an insignificant popularity hog who cares too much about the spotlight and not enough about her impacts on her in-laws. We fought for freedom against Britain when Washington crossed the Delaware River in 1776, when we held up the flag of freedom with the bodies of dead patriots at Fort McHenry in 1814, and when we repelled them from New Orleans in 1815 under the command of General Jackson. Our ancestors fled the British thumb so that we wouldn’t have to deal with such trivial things as this.
— Henry Alley, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NC
In the links in the article, “Black Britons Know Why Meghan Markle Wants Out”, it said Meghan was associated with gangs and terrorism, and I think it was because of the color of her skin. The press chooses to focus on her heritage and the color of her skin rather than focus on her being an advocate for women’s rights and donating to numerous charities. There was even an article written about Archie, their son, comparing him to a chimp which is obviously racially charged.
This is also why I respect their decision to step down, to protect themselves and their son from the hate of the British Press. While reading this article, the question arises, “Would she have been treated any differently if she was white?
— Tori Okorodudu, J.R Masterman, Philadelphia, PA
When I heard that Prince Harry and Meghan were stepping back, I wasn’t surprised. I feel like they’re just wanting what’s best for baby Archie and don’t want so much attention. But also, I kind of feel like they’re letting down their own family. Also, they’ve been given so many good things financially, so why would they want to start their own modern lifestyle? I kind of feel like they’re taking it all for granted. And even though the Queen has recently granted them the permission to go to Canada, it’s still in my opinion kind of rude.

In our Picture Prompt, “‘A 📖 of Two 🏙,” a graphic artist rewrote the first line of Charles Dickens’s “A Tale of Two Cities” using emojis.
We asked students to give it a try with their favorite books and we loved what they came up with. See if you can guess where these lines are from. (Answers below.)

(In my defense I’m on a computer, so no emojis) For starters I don’t even know how I was able to read all that. I guess since I’ve been using emojis since they were ugly, aka the iPhone 5 era …
So the picture was about a story by Charles Dickens, called A Tale of Two Cities. And I get the Two part because every line that has an emoji is the opposite. For example it says, “It was the season of light (light bulb emoji), it was the season of darkness (black box emoji), saying the season was filled with light and dark moments. Ya’ll if that’s wrong I don’t know how, because I just used my context clues.
