The Grammys, Dissected: Out With the Old, in With the Billie, Lizzo and Tyler
Another year, another mystifying Grammy Awards. The 62nd annual affair, which took place on Sunday night, had the usual retinue of awkward “Grammy moments,” overlong performances and unlikely pairings. But it also was a coronation of a new generation of pop stars — Billie Eilish, who won five trophies, including a sweep of the four biggest categories; Lizzo; Tyler, the Creator and others.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about the ongoing Grammy crisis, including the removal of the Recording Academy chief executive Deborah Dugan, and the ways this year’s show did and didn’t help the argument that the Grammys are concerned with diversity.
Also, The New York Times pop music team is in full debate mode — over the meaning of Eilish’s success, over what makes Lizzo tick, over the Aerosmith/Run-D.M.C. performance, over the Grammy regular Gary Clark Jr. and much more.
