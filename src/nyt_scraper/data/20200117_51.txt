Dating is hard no matter what. In this week’s Modern Love essay, writer M. Leona Godin, who has been progressively losing her sight since the age of 10, shares how her blindness often spurs feelings of insecurity in her relationship.
In this week’s Vows column, the writer T Kira Madden finds forever with Hannah Beresford, a former professional equestrian and a poet. The couple, who married earlier this month in Kaneohe, Hawaii, first bonded over horses and later solidified their connection after swapping books they wrote.
