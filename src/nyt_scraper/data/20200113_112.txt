Shopping for Coasters
No one wants be that anxious host who hovers over guests in the living room, trying to slip coasters under their drinks when they’re not looking. Then again, no one wants to see their furniture ruined by ring marks.
The solution? Invest in interesting, well-designed coasters that you’ll be happy to leave lying around and guests will enjoy using.
As Jacob Briars, the global advocacy director at Bacardi, pointed out, coasters aren’t just functional: “They also have an aesthetic role, which is to frame the drink. It’s a chance for you to show off with a little flourish.”
Given that, you may want to own several styles.
“You might think about changing up the coasters depending on the sorts of drinks you’re serving,” said Mr. Briars, who is also an owner of a travel-themed bar called Clipper, in Auckland, New Zealand, where bartenders have been known to match cocktails to coasters depicting the countries in which the drinks were created.
“If you put a great drink on a well-thought-out coaster,” he said, “it makes the moment even more special.”
