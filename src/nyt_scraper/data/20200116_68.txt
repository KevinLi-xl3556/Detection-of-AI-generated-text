Where Age Is the Thing: Rioja Gran Reserva
If ever a wine seemed out of step with the times, it would be Rioja Gran Reserva.
The rest of the wine world has adopted the Burgundian way of thinking, in which a wine is defined by the place in which the grapes were grown. The more distinctive the vineyard, and the more narrowly circumscribed, the more prized the wine.
But Rioja Gran Reserva is defined not by terroir — as long as the grapes come from the confines of the Rioja appellation in northern Spain — but by how long the wine has aged. The rules require gran reservas to have been aged at least two years in barrels and three in bottles before they can be released.
