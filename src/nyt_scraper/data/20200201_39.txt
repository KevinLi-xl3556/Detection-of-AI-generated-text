When Did the Super Bowl Halftime Show Become Political?
For many years — decades even — the Super Bowl halftime show was an uncontroversial distraction, a way for the N.F.L. to retain eyeballs and collect advertising dollars in between the two halves of the most watched game of the year.
But something that is seen by that many people can easily become a site of protest (political, or just petulant), or simply disrupted, whether by the Justin Timberlake/Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, or M.I.A. flashing a middle finger to the camera or Prince’s very careful guitar placement.
In the post-Kaepernick era, the halftime show has taken on a whole new political valence. Rihanna declined the opportunity to perform last year in solidarity with the quarterback. And in advance of this year’s show, the N.F.L. entered into a business relationship with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, which is now helping to produce the halftime extravaganza. This year’s scheduled performers are Jennifer Lopez and Shakira.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about the history of the halftime show, and how its meaning has evolved over the last two decades.
