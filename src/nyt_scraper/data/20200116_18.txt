Film Club: ‘Darlin’
“Darlin” is a powerful 16-minute film by Isabel Castro touching on themes of hope, determination and courage in the face of the unknown. It profiles one Honduran family in the months after they were separated by U.S. detention policy. We follow Darlin, a young Honduran mother living in Texas, and her first-grade son Hamilthon as they live for months suspended in limbo not knowing when or if their family will be reunited again.
What can we learn from their story? What can it tell us about U.S. immigration policy?
