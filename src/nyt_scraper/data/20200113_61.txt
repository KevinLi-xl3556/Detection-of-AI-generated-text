What the Heck Is That?
Solvers of Alex Eaton-Salners’s Thursday, Jan. 9 crossword puzzle had a hard enough time deciphering the tricky theme, but RUPIAHS, a nontheme entry, also gave them trouble.
RUPIAHS are the currency of Indonesia. The rupiah became Indonesia’s official monetary unit in 1949, when it replaced the Indonesian Dutch East Indies guilder.
RUPIAHS was a debut entry in the New York Times Crossword, and it was clued as “Indonesian money.”
