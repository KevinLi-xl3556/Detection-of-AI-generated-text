Jerrold Nadler: Impeachment Manager Will Tie Case to Constitution
WASHINGTON — When Representative Jerrold Nadler campaigned two years ago to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, he billed himself as the “strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.”
Mr. Nadler got the job, and last December, he led the Judiciary Committee as it drafted and approved two articles of impeachment against President Trump.
