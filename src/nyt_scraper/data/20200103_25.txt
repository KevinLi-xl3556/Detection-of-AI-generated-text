Medicine in the Middle Ages

In his new book, “Medieval Bodies: Life and Death in the Middle Ages,” the British art historian Jack Hartnell looks back at views on medicine in the Middle Ages. “It’s a mistake to cast the Middle Ages as a muddy and backward time when truth was hidden, onionlike, under layers of superstition and dogma,” our reviewer Josephine Livingstone writes. “Medieval culture simply valued different standards.”
Or, as Hartnell puts it in his appearance on this week’s podcast: “I think if we want to be seen sympathetically by cultures in 500 years’ time, who look back and I’m sure will think of many things that we do today as deeply barbaric and very basic in  medical understanding, then I think we have to have just as much sympathy for people 500 years before us.”
The Book Review’s art director, Matt Dorfman, also visits the podcast this week, to discuss his work for The Times and also his work as a book-cover designer. Dorfman says he looks for books that are “a little bit weird” when he takes on cover assignments. “The thing that I love about books is the same thing that I hate about certain people. I like books that are really, really self-absorbed, and are in many ways kind of cut off from the rest of the outside world and just really boring deep down into whatever ideas that they’re chasing.”
Also on this week’s episode, Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai talk about the books they’ve recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.
Here are the books discussed by The Times’s critics this week:
