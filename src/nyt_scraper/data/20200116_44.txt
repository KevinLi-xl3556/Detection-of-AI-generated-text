No Charges in Assault Complaint at V.A. Hospital, and a Public Fight Erupts
WASHINGTON — Federal authorities have declined to file charges after a House staff member said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington, setting up a highly unusual public confrontation among a cabinet secretary, a congressional committee chairman and an inspector general.
In September, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said she was assaulted on Sept. 20 while buying a snack at the medical center’s cafeteria. Ms. Goldstein, who works on the sexual assault issue for the committee, said a man slammed his body against hers below the waist and told her that “you look like you could use a good time,” Ms. Goldstein said in an interview.
