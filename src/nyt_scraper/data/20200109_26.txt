6 Classical Music Concerts to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at the Kaplan Penthouse (Jan. 16, 7:30 p.m.). Much of the society’s output still comes from the “long 19th century,” as with a concert of Suk, Janacek, Debussy and Brahms at Alice Tully Hall in the coming week (Tuesday, 7:30 p.m.). But seeing it explore more recent music with increasing enthusiasm is gratifying. A few years ago, it would never have scheduled this concert of electronic music, which includes Saariaho’s “Trois Rivières” and Stockhausen’s “Kontakte”; praise be that it now does.

LUCY DHEGRAE at National Sawdust (Jan. 11, 8 p.m.). For the second concert in Dhegrae’s valuable Processing Series, which is her artistic response to the trauma of an assault, the singer performs works by Machaut, Poulenc, Eve Beglarian, Amadeus Regucera, Philippe Leroux, Georges Aperghis and Peter Kramer.
646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org
‘ELLEN WEST’ at the Gelsey Kirkland Arts Center (Jan. 14-15, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 19). Frank Bidart’s poem is the libretto for this Ricky Ian Gordon opera, which examines the lives of Ellen West and her psychiatrist, Ludwig Binswanger. Lidiya Yankovskaya conducts a production by Emma Griffin, featuring the singers Jennifer Zetlan and Nathan Gunn. Among the other performances at the utterly essential Prototype festival in the coming week is the premiere of “Magdalene,” which sets poetry by Marie Howe to music by 14 women in a creation by Danielle Birrittella and Zoe Aja Moore.

LONGLEASH at Flushing Town Hall (Jan. 10, 7:30 p.m.). The 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth approaches, bringing with it all kinds of opportunities to think about what the composer means for us today — or what, perhaps, he ought to mean. This progressive young trio puts him into context by performing two of his trios with works responding to them: John Zorn’s “Ghosts” and Reiko Füting’s “Free — Whereof — Wherefore,” which receives its premiere. Appearing as part of the Five Boroughs Music Festival, the ensemble also plays at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church later in the weekend (Sunday, 3 p.m.).

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 15-16, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 21). Gustavo Dudamel, the shock-haired music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is on the podium at Lincoln Center for the next two weeks, starting with this program of Ives’s “The Unanswered Question,” Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9 and Esteban Benzecry’s Piano Concerto, “Universos infinitos,” with the soloist Sergio Tiempo. Schubert and Mahler are on the bill for Dudamel’s second round of concerts (Jan. 23-25).

‘LA TRAVIATA’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 10 and 14, 7:30 p.m.; through March 19). Michael Mayer’s production returns for the first time since its debut during the 2018-19 season, for the first of two runs with two separate casts. Through Feb. 7, Karel Mark Chichon conducts Aleksandra Kurzak as Violetta, Dmytro Popov as Alfredo and Quinn Kelsey as Germont. Lisette Oropesa takes over as Violetta beginning on Feb. 26.
