Broadway Playwright as High Line Curator
Jeremy O. Harris, who wrote the acclaimed and provocative “Slave Play,” will be a curator of the High Line’s 2020 “Out of Line” series next summer, which features experimental and multidisciplinary artistic performances inspired by the High Line.
“I’m interested in seeing what happens when you put two different artists from different worlds together like music and dance,” Mr. Harris said. “What happens when you try to facilitate a John Cage with a Merce Cunningham?”
The 2020 series will for the first time be presented as a three-day festival (in the past it was held on single days in June, July, and August).
Mr. Harris will team up on the series with Diya Vij, the High Line’s associate curator of public programs.
“Producing and curating are at the core of my mission as a maker,” Mr. Harris said. “How do you curate a space around an event or a piece of art? How do you produce a landscape that is healthy for artists to come behind you?”
