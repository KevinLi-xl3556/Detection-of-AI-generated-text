How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?
No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every week for new suggestions on what to watch.
‘Take the Podium’
When to watch: Now, on YouTube.
This web series follows Olympians who are receiving retroactive medals after the athletes they initially lost to were disqualified for using performance-enhancing drugs. Christine Girard, a Canadian weight lifter, placed fourth in 2008 and third in 2012 — until new testing revealed that she should have won a bronze medal in Beijing and a gold in London. While the show is laughably vague about drug testing and corruption, the athletes themselves are forthcoming about their careers, their heartache and the surprising compassion they have toward their competitors.
‘Anne With an E’
When to watch: Season 3 arrives Friday, on Netflix.
The third and final season of this hearty “Anne of Green Gables” adaptation starts with Anne (Amybeth McNulty) celebrating her 16th birthday — not the beginning of adulthood, really, but the beginning of something. She seeks out her biological family, bristles against arbitrary social mores, makes some new friends and a few new enemies, marvels at the romance of it all, weeps righteous tears and swears valiant oaths. If you feel the call toward Anne and Avonlea, definitely start with Season 1.
‘Brockmire’
When to watch: Now, on Hulu.
If you love raunchy language and can explain the infield fly rule, or if you wish “BoJack Horseman” were about broadcasting instead of Hollywood, embrace “Brockmire,” which is both mega filthy and weirdly pure. Hank Azaria stars as a washed-up baseball announcer, and in the third season — now streaming — he’s newly sober and stuck in another small town, in a stadium that “smells so bad it actually hurts my feelings.” This is a perfect show to binge; individual episodes fly by, but full seasons still have real heft.
