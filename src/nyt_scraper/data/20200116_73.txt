Carlos Beltran Out as Mets Manager After Cheating Scandal
Three days after he was implicated in the Houston Astros’ cheating scandal, Carlos Beltran and the Mets agreed he should step down as manager of the team on Thursday, leaving the job before he had held his first practice.
“We met with Carlos last night and again this morning and agreed to mutually part ways,” Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer, said in a statement released by the team. “This was not an easy decision. Considering the circumstances, it became clear to all parties that it was not in anyone’s best interest for Carlos to move forward as Manager of the New York Mets.”
