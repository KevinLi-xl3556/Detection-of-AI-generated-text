Rare Culinary Editions on View
This is Bibliography Week in New York, an annual showcase for the Bibliographical Society of America and the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America (A.B.A.A.), with exhibits, book sales and events in many locations. Vintage culinary volumes are on display and for sale from several merchants, including Ben Kinmont of Sebastopol, Calif., whose specialty is books and manuscripts about food and drink from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Among them is a rare first edition of Gustave Davin’s 1887 volume, “A Propos des Vignes Américaines,” which discusses American rootstock at the time of the phylloxera infestation in Europe.
