Pete Davidson’s ‘King of Staten Island’ Will Open South by Southwest 2020
The first high-profile leading role for the “Saturday Night Live” cast member Pete Davidson will be showcased at this year’s South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin.
“The King of Staten Island,” directed by Judd Apatow, will have its premiere on March 13, the festival announced on Wednesday. Apatow’s work has regularly appeared in the festival, but this is the first time one of his features will get the opening-night  slot.
Davidson plays a struggling young man living at home with his mother (Marisa Tomei). The movie is inspired by the star’s experiences growing up in the borough. The actor, who has been public about his bouts with mental health issues, co-wrote the screenplay with Apatow and Dave Sirus.
This is Apatow’s first narrative feature since his collaboration with Amy Schumer in 2015, “Trainwreck,” which also had its premiere at SXSW. “The King of Staten Island” will open nationwide June 19.
The festival also announced its features and episodics slate, which consists of more than 100 titles. Film highlights include “Beastie Boys Story,” a documentary on the band by Spike Jonze; “The Lovebirds,” a murder mystery comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani; “Critical Thinking,” John Leguizamo’s look at a group of black and Latinx teenagers who become national championship chess players; and “Clerk,” a documentary about the filmmaker Kevin Smith by Malcolm Ingram.
The festival, which runs March 13-22, will also premiere episodes of “Snowpiercer,” the TNT series based on the Oscar nominee Bong Joon Ho’s 2013 film, and “Central Park,” the animated musical comedy coming to Apple TV Plus.
