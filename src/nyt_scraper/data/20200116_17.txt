After Hashtag Activism, Hollywood Assistants Get a Raise
Using the hashtag #PayUpHollywood, assistants working in the entertainment industry have been agitating in recent months for higher wages and more considerate treatment from their sometimes mercurial bosses.
The assistants scored a small victory recently, when Creative Artists Agency, one of the Big Four talent agencies in Los Angeles, announced that it was raising pay for its hourly workers, a group that includes assistants, mailroom clerks, receptionists and agent trainees.
