CASHMERE CAT at Webster Hall (Jan. 17, 8 p.m.). Few artists have navigated the parallel universes of pop and electronic music with as much success — or as little interest in the spotlight — as this Norwegian producer, born Magnus August Hoiberg. On his 2017 album, “9,” which featured guest turns by the likes of Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, his pop allegiances seemed to be winning out; in retrospect, those big names may just have been decoys behind which the attention-averse Hoiberg could hide. “Princess Catgirl,” his latest release, uses a different tactic: Instead of wielding A-list star power, Hoiberg created the titular digital avatar to be the face of his pillowy synthetic soundscapes.
