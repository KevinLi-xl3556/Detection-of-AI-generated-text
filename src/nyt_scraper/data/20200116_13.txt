New in Paperback: ‘The Source of Self-Regard’ and ‘Horizon’
THE SOURCE OF SELF-REGARD: Selected Essays, Speeches, and Meditations, by Toni Morrison. (Vintage, $16.95.) These 43 shorter pieces by the Nobel laureate include a stirring tribute to the 9/11 victims, a eulogy for James Baldwin, an address given to Amnesty International and glimpses of the thinking behind some of her early novels. “Morrison, quietly and without ceremony, lays another gem at our feet,” James McBride wrote in these pages.
HOUSE OF STONE, by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma. (Norton, $17.95.) The protagonist of this debut is an orphan born in the violent aftermath of Zimbabwe’s war for independence. He tries to reinvent himself by becoming part of another family, whose son has mysteriously disappeared. Our reviewer, Dinaw Mengestu, called it a “remarkable first novel.”
