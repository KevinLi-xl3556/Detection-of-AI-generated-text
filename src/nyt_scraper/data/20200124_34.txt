Ivanka Trump, Pretending to Help Women
To the Editor:
Re “President’s Daughter Is Presented as a Principal at Davos” (news article, Jan. 23):
Ivanka Trump’s Women’s Empowerment Initiative is as much about empowering women around the world as Trump University was about educating people.
She has stood by her father as his most trusted adviser as he has imposed policy after policy undermining women’s health, autonomy and economic opportunity. It started three years ago, when he imposed his disgraceful global gag rule on American global health assistance. The result has been closed clinics, contraceptive shortages and the shifting of aid from real health care providers to ideological allies.
Moreover, Ms. Trump has supported her father as he stripped reproductive rights from the State Department’s yearly Human Rights Report; eliminated aid to the United Nations Population Fund, hamstringing its work in 150 countries to expand access to contraceptives and provide emergency obstetric care, among other crucial services; and withdrew health care access from millions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers.
While pretending to fight for the economic empowerment of women, Ivanka Trump has watched her father promote policies that do the exact opposite.
