Corrections: Jan. 12, 2020
An article on Oct. 13 about the use of images from the photo-sharing site Flickr in facial-recognition technology misstated a goal of the CyberPatriot program. It encourages young people to pursue careers in fields like cybersecurity, not just careers in intelligence and the military. This correction was delayed, because the error was only recently brought to the editors’ attention.
The With Interest column last Sunday overstated the net worth of the businessman Carlos Ghosn. He is a multimillionaire, not a billionaire.
The No. 7 entry on Page 4 about Sicily misspelled the name of a wine family in Sicily. It is the Tasca d’Almerita, not Almitra.
The No. 26 entry on Page 12 about Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, misstated the name of a park reserve and heritage site in British Columbia. It is Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, not Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve.
The New & Noteworthy column on Dec. 29 misstated the available format and price for “Race Man,” by Julian Bond. The book is available in paperback, not hardcover. And it is listed for $22.95, not $24.95.
