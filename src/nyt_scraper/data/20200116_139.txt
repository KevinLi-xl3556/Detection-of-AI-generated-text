Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Like many Americans today, I have a bit of an obsession with the Roaring ’20s. I spent a happy spring wandering around Paris and finding all the spots where Hemingway, Fitzgerald and their gang of expats hung out. I’ve been known to throw on beaded headbands and fringed dresses for Jazz Age-themed lawn parties. Even my go-to summer cocktail — a lavender-infused bee’s knees — dates to the days of speakeasies and bathtub gin.
