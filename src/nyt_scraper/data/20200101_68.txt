Judge John Hodgman on Uncle Money Bags
Lucy writes: My brother-in-law, Johnny, is a wonderful uncle. Too wonderful, actually. Every time we see him, he slips my son some cash, like a slick gangster. My son is 7. He just leaves the cash around the house. I’ve told Johnny to stop giving my ungrateful son money, but he says he likes doing it. Can I make him stop?
I really want the story to be that Johnny is handing your son crisp hundos, but even in small denominations, I agree that there is something a little seedy about slipping a 7-year-old cash as if he’s a maître d’ at a mobbed-up supper club. That said, it does no real harm to allow Johnny to express avuncular love with money. Save it for college (or Johnny’s bail), and maybe check to make sure Johnny hasn’t also stashed a bunch of cigarette cartons or an El Chapo-style hidy-hole under your son’s bed.
