Stocks Continue Record Climb as Earnings Overshadow Impeachment
Stocks rose to another record on Thursday as solid corporate earnings and the easing of trade war tensions added to Wall Street’s strong start in 2020.
The S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 indexes all ended the day in record territory. Tech and semiconductor shares, which had been sensitive to worries about the trade war and the slowdown of the global economy last year, led the gains. Google’s parent, Alphabet, closed at a market capitalization of $1 trillion for the first time.
