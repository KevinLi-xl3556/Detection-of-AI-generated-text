Taal Volcano Eases, but Philippines Worries Worst Is to Come
BALETE, Philippines — Taal Volcano’s eruptions have eased in the past 24 hours, scientists said on Wednesday, but they warned that the picturesque mountain was still threatening hundreds of thousands of people just 40 miles south of Manila.
Renato Solidum, Jr., who leads the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said that Taal’s calm could be deceptive.
