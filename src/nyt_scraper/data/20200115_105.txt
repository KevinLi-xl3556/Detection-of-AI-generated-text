Hyde Park, N.Y.: A Gilded Age Getaway With a Friendly Vibe
Ann Weiser and Neil Krupnick moved to Hyde Park, N.Y., three and a half years ago, driven from their home on the North Fork of Long Island by boredom and high taxes. A friend introduced them to the historic town of Hyde Park in Dutchess County, about 90 miles north of Manhattan.
“You can’t run out of things to do in the Hudson Valley,” said Ms. Weiser, 62, a retired television executive.
