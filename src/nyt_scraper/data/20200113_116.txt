The Times Editorial Board Endorses Klobuchar and WarrenThe Times Editorial Board Endorses Klobuchar and Warren
Between coffee-shop chats in Iowa and stump speeches in New Hampshire, candidates for the Democratic nomination for president visited The New York Times last month for a series of on-the-record conversations with the editorial board.
For up to 90 minutes at a time, the leading Democrats in the race defended their records, sparred with the board over policy, and made their pitches for the chance to challenge President Trump in November.
Watch the freewheeling conversations in a special, hourlong episode of “The Weekly” on Sunday, Jan. 19, at 10 p.m. ET on FX, and streaming at 11 p.m. on Hulu — and see which candidate The Times editorial board will endorse for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from The New York Times newsroom.
For their conversations with the Democratic candidates, the regular members of the board were joined by other opinion writers and editors. James Bennet, the editorial page editor, recused himself from any involvement in the 2020 elections. His brother, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, is running for the Democratic nomination.


The editorial board published annotated transcripts of its conversations with the Democratic candidates. Read the full transcripts and watch edited video excerpts.
