Coaching Female Athletes, and Gender Inequality
To the Editor:
As a former Stanford student athlete and now a faculty athletic representative at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I read “A Women’s Sport, Ruled by Male Coaches” (news article, Dec. 20) with great interest.
It is not surprising that a male coach “fumbled to answer the question” of why there are not more women in top coaching jobs. Anyone would, as the answer requires an explanation of longstanding gender inequality in this country that transcends athletics and defies justification, a complexity my colleagues and I explored in our recent JAMA Internal Medicine commentary.
As a former Division 1 student athlete coached by a man I consider one of my greatest role models and mentors, I think it is really important not to assume that the way to promote women in these roles is to diminish the accomplishments or legitimacy of male coaches.
An N.C.A.A. president once predicted that Title IX ”could seriously damage if not destroy the major men’s intercollegiate athletic programs.” Instead, more than 40 years later, collegiate men and women both achieve at the highest levels.
Likewise, promoting gender equity and diversity in coaching through mentorship, role modeling, sponsorship and opportunity should raise the bar for everyone.
