Ed Ruscha: He Up and Went Home
LOS ANGELES — The artist Ed Ruscha has been based in Los Angeles since 1956, and has spent the better part of the last 60 years exploring that city’s iconography in a deadpan style that wavers between mundane and philosophical.
He has documented — sometimes in black and white photographs, but mostly in oil on canvas — gas stations, parking lots, swimming pools, the apartment blocks of struggling actors, the Hollywood sign (which on clear days he used to be able to see from his old studio) and, in his large body of text-based paintings, the kind of transactional language one could imagine overhearing at a power lunch at any point in the last half-century, such as: “That was then this is now,” “Honey, I twisted through more damn traffic today,” “Pay nothing until April” and the iconic “Oof.”
