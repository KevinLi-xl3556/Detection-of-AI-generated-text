A Single Pot Irish Whiskey Comes to America
As Irish whiskey becomes increasingly popular, climbing back up toward to the top-selling position it held 100 years ago, new distilleries are opening at a fast clip. One of them, Teeling Whiskey, established a distillery in Dublin in 2012, and now its first spirit made entirely in the city is available. Other Teelingâ€™s whiskies, which have a history going back to 1782, have been produced in part at family distilleries north of Dublin. The new single pot still whiskey, a honeyed dram both in color and flavor, makes for rich sipping, on the rocks in early evening or later or straight up to mellow the mood after dinner.
