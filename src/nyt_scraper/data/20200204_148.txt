Corrections: Feb. 4, 2020
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the helicopter crash that killed NBA star Kobe Bryant and eight others described incorrectly the minimum visibility requirements for flight under federal visual flight rules. They require a helicopter flying at low altitude in daylight to have at least a half-mile of visibility and visual reference to the ground, not at least three miles of visibility and a cloud ceiling no lower than 1,000 feet above the ground.
An article on Saturday about Senator Lamar Alexander’s decision to vote against having witnesses at President Trump’s impeachment trial misstated the middle initial of former Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee. He is Howard H. Baker Jr., not Howard R. Baker Jr.
An article on Saturday about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv misspelled the surname of the director of the New Europe Center in Kyiv, Ukraine. She is Alyona Getmanchuk, not Gemantchuk.
An article on Saturday about Latino culture and Super Bowl LIV misstated the surname of the owner of Martha of Miami. She is Martha Valdes, not Ochoa.
A television review on Monday about Super Bowl LIV referred incorrectly to Dreamers. Dreamers are undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children; they are not American-born children of undocumented immigrants.
