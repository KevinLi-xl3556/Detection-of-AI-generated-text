What Will Each Senator Say About Trump? We Deserve to Know
Twenty-one years ago, the public and the press were shut out of some of the most critical parts of the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. The Senate closed its doors so that senators could deliberate in secret on key motions and, most important, on whether to convict him.
The Senate did the same thing in 1868, closing the trial of Andrew Johnson, the only other president to have been impeached by the House until now. Like President Clinton, President Johnson prevailed. In both cases, though the deliberations were secret, the vote on whether to convict was public. But thatâ€™s not enough.
