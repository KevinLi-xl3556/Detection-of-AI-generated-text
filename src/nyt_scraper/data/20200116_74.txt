Key Moments as Trumpâ€™s Impeachment Trial Formally Begins
With the six other House Democrats serving as impeachment managers beside him, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, ceremoniously walked the articles of impeachment from the House chamber to the Senate chamber midday Thursday. It was the second such journey for the group in the past 24 hours, after formally delivering the articles to the Senate on Wednesday evening.
With the full Senate seated before him, Mr. Schiff read aloud the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against Mr. Trump. The two charges together are just over eight pages long.
