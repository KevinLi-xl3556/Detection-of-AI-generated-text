Sounds of the City
Daniel Arnold found this screeching Times Square performer (above), a fixture in one of the most claustrophobic corners of the city. “In my imagination she’s always been a defiant and sarcastic response to the Naked Cowboy,” Arnold said, referring to the neighborhood’s scantily clad guitarist. How would he describe the sound she makes? “Blaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!”
Arnold also ventured south, where he found an exploding manhole near Union Square, a child making a brave choice in SoHo and a cat warning off intruders downtown.
Daniel Weiss walked more than 30 miles over four days in search of New York’s most visual sounds. One of the places he landed: Mona’s, a bar in the East Village where patrons feed the jukebox until the wee hours. He also photographed a saxophonist, a commuter and a skater finding their own grooves, and a flock of birds preparing to chirp their own symphony.
New York noises can be harsh, but Caroline Tompkins found solace on a ferry between Manhattan and Brooklyn: “The river water lapping onto the sides of the boat. The winter wind almost painfully rushing past your ears.” The photographs bring to mind “the sanctuaries we all find for ourselves here,” she said.
Every day subway riders are treated to mini concerts, which they can choose to enjoy or ignore. Ike Edeani opted in: “To actually spend time observing the activity in a space that I’ve only ever moved through was beautiful,” he said.
