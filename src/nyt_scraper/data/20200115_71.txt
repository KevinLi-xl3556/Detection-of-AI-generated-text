Jason Crow: Impeachment Manager Who Pressed to Launch Inquiry
WASHINGTON — As a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Representative Jason Crow, who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018, has quickly emerged in the Democratic caucus as a leading voice on national security.
Drawing on those credentials and his experience as a litigator, Speaker Nancy Pelosi named the Colorado Democrat as an impeachment manager on Wednesday, selecting him as part of the team of lawmakers who will play a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats’ case against President Trump in the Senate trial.
