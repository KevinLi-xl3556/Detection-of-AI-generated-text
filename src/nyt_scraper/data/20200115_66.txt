England’s Only County Without a McDonald’s Is About to Get One
LONDON — The county of Rutland, England’s smallest by some measures, has for years had varied gastronomic options: pub food, Indian cuisine, tapas and even a restaurant with a Michelin star.
But it was the only English county not to have a McDonald’s — until now.
The local council on Tuesday approved an application by McDonald’s for a new restaurant in the county, a decision that many in the area viewed as a surrender of England’s last fortress to fast-food’s signature golden arches, despite a promise by the company that the outlet would provide at least 65 jobs.
