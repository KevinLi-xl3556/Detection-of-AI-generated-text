Nature Shows Are Hot Again
At a time when millions of species are at risk of extinction and deep-pocketed streaming services are spending billions on content, an old television genre, the nature show, is booming.
On Saturday, the latest big-budget nature documentary series from BBC Studios, “Seven Worlds, One Planet,” will make its debut in the United States across various AMC cable networks like BBC America and SundanceTV. The first installment of the series, which is a follow-up to the recent ratings hits “Planet Earth II” and “Blue Planet II,” will focus on Australia.
