Review: Gustavo Dudamel Jolts the ‘New World’ Symphony to Life
Though Dvorak’s stirring, tuneful “New World” Symphony is justly popular, it tops my list of works that are heard too often for their own good. Perhaps my attitude comes in part from overkill during college: The instructor of a gym class I took played excerpts during exercise sessions. Even today, when I’m at a performance and the stern, pulsing third movement begins, I feel like I should be in the aisle doing jumping jacks.
So all credit to Gustavo Dudamel, who led the New York Philharmonic in a fresh, insightful and exciting performance of the work at David Geffen Hall on Wednesday. This varied program opened with Ives and included the New York premiere of a colorfully eclectic piano concerto by Esteban Benzecry. Yet Dvorak’s war horse was the unexpected highlight.
