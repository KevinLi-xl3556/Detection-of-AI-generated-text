Love Letter: For Romance, Just Add Water
[Sign up here to receive Love Letter, a weekly newsletter about relationship highs, lows and woes, in your inbox every Friday.]
Dating fatigue is a real thing, and in this week’s Modern Love essay, Colleen Kinder, who had grown disenchanted with searching for love online, flees the Brooklyn dating scene to teach a Semester at Sea course. And there she embarks on an unlikely love affair aboard a seven-story cruise ship with a man she would never have swiped right on.
Feelings of sadness and grief can be overwhelming during times of tragedy and loss. It’s important to unplug, reset and love yourself. While you’re at it, here’s how you can get back to your happy place.
Also, we’re trying something new. We want to answer your love questions right here in the Love Letter newsletter. Email your love and relationship questions to us and we will do our best to provide thoughtful advice, support and resources. Please be sure to include your name, city and state, along with your question.
We want to deliver content that truly matters to you and your feedback is helpful. Email your thoughts to loveletter@nytimes.com.
Also, here’s how to submit a Modern Love essay or how to be featured in an Unhitched column. Don’t feel like writing more than a tweet, an Instagram caption or a Facebook post? Consider submitting to Tiny Love Stories, which are no more than 100 words. Getting married? Here’s how to submit a wedding announcement.
