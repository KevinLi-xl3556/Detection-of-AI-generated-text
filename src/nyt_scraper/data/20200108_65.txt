‘Targeted’ Shooting in Ottawa Leaves One Dead and at Least 3 Injured, Police Say
At least one person was killed and three others injured in a shooting on a residential street in Ottawa on Wednesday, the authorities in the Canadian capital said.
Though initial alerts sent out around 8 a.m. ET suggested a gunman was at large on the 400 block of Gilmour Street, near the city center, the Ottawa Police later said they believed it was a “targeted shooting” that unfolded both inside and outside a home.
“It wasn’t an active shooter running around shooting people,” said Constable Amy Gagnon of the Ottawa Police. “It was targeted.”
She said the police were still investigating what led to the shooting, which occurred about half a mile from Parliament Hill, the home of the country’s legislature. The police said they were still looking for at least one gunman.
Two people were brought to the Ottawa Hospital and were in critical condition, said Michaela Schreiter, a spokeswoman for the hospital. And a 15-year-old boy was brought to CHEO, a pediatric hospital and research center in Ottawa, said Patrick Moore, a hospital spokesman. The boy is in stable condition, Mr. Moore said.
One person was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.
The shooting was reported on a residential street near a commercial area in the Centretown neighborhood lined with casual restaurants, big retail stores and grocers.
