The Crossword Stumper
Anyone up for a rousing game of CALVINBALL? It’s not hard to learn, because players make up the rules as they go along and the only known scoring is either “Q to 12” or “oogy to boogy.” You are allowed to use any sporting equipment you like, and combining the equipment of different sports is highly encouraged. Masks are to be worn at all times and are never to be questioned.
CALVINBALL was the brainchild of the titular characters in the cartoonist Bill Watterson’s “Calvin and Hobbes,” which ran in newspapers from 1985 to 1995. According to the “Calvin and Hobbes” fandom wiki, “CALVINBALL has no rules; the players make up their own rules as they go along, making it so that no CALVINBALL game is like another.
“Rules cannot be used twice (except for the rule that rules cannot be used twice), and any plays made in one game may not be made again in any future games. The game may involve wickets, mallets, volleyballs and additional sports-related equipment.
“There is only one permanent rule in CALVINBALL: players cannot play it the same way twice. For example, in one game of CALVINBALL, the goal was to capture the opponent’s flag, whereas in a different game of CALVINBALL, the goal was to score points by hitting badminton shuttlecocks against trees using a croquet mallet.”
The in-universe reason for CALVINBALL is that Calvin is unsuccessful at joining the sports teams in his “real” life, and thus has little patience for organized games with definitive rules. In the final strip, a game of football morphs into a game of CALVINBALL, with perennial 6-year-old Calvin remarking, “Sooner or later, all our games turn into CALVINBALL.”
The entry CALVINBALL appeared in the Wednesday, Jan. 1 crossword puzzle by Christina Iverson and Jeff Chen. This is only the second time the game has appeared in the New York Times Crossword.
