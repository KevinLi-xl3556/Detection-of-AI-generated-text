Judge John Hodgman on Grocery Store Baskets
Adam writes: When my girlfriend and I enter a grocery store, I often forget to grab a basket. She always asks me, ‘‘Did you want to get a basket?’’ I find this question condescending. Of course I want a basket. I just forgot. I have asked her to simply say, ‘‘Hey, grab a basket.’’ She thinks this is rude.
It’s true that your girlfriend’s question is condescending, and that is exactly what you deserve. When our children were younger, we had a saying in our house: Accidents will happen, but stop having so many of them. Same goes with you and the grocery basket. Stop forgetting it. I promise you it will require less effort than conjuring an alternate universe in which your girlfriend is wrong, just to escape the embarrassment you feel for repeatedly making this dumb error. Grab a basket like everyone else on Earth, and free yourself from this shame cycle!
