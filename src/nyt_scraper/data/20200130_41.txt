Film Club: ‘Never Too Old for a Tiara’
“Never Too Old for a Tiara” is a six-minute film that touches on themes of aging, beauty and breaking stereotypes about what older adults can or can’t do. It profiles competitors in the Ms. Senior America contest, who unlike Miss America beauty pageant contestants are not women on the cusp of adulthood, but instead are women who have experienced life in all of its joys and sorrows. They’re still kicking — and kicking high.
What can we learn about life, glamour, joy and competitive spirits from Krystyna Farley, 91, and her fellow pageant contestants?
