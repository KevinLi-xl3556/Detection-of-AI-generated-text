Did You Recently Pay Off Your Student Loans?
Student debt is one of the most debated issues in the Democratic presidential primary.
Candidates such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are calling for tuition-free college for all and erasing student loans, and Pete Buttigieg argues those things should be limited to the poor and middle class, while Joe Biden favors two free years of community college. Ms. Warren has argued that college is a basic good, akin to K-12 education, a position Mr. Buttigieg has called elitist. Collectively, the nation’s student debt amounts to $1.6 trillion — an amount Mr. Sanders’s plan would wipe out entirely.
We’d like to hear from people who paid off their student loans in the past year, or from those who are still making payments. A Times reporter or editor may follow up with you to hear more about your story.
