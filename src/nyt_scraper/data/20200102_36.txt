Joe Biden, Demand That You Testify
To the Editor:
Re “Changing Course, Biden Now Says He’d Comply if Subpoenaed” (news article, Dec. 29):
It is a positive sign that Joe Biden has stated that he would comply with a subpoena issued in any impeachment trial in the Senate. But he should take a further step; he should demand to be called to testify.
The House Republicans continually complained that Mr. Biden was not called to testify. Here is the opportunity for him to be heard.
Mr. Biden’s testimony would serve two purposes. He could use the process to clear his name of the false allegations that have been levied against him. And it would show the country that, unlike the Republicans who refuse to call the witnesses that Senator Chuck Schumer has named, the Democrats have nothing to hide.
It is time to expose Senator Mitch McConnell for the manipulative politician that he is. Mr. Biden can do just that.

Re “Sonny Mehta, Knopf’s Guru of the Bookshelves, Is Dead at 77” (obituaries, Jan. 1):
Sonny Mehta was my first editor. We sat in his New York City apartment for two days, going through the manuscript of my first novel, “The Flamingo Rising.” Line by line, almost word by word. I learned more about the writing process in those two days than I had before or have since.
At one point, after we had quibbled about another one of his “suggestions,” I got exasperated. “Sonny, with all these problems, why did you even buy the book?” He took a puff of his cigarette and said, “Because I saw a wonderful story with a lot of sloppy writing getting in the way.”
