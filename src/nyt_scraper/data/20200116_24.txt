I.R.S. Exempts Some Forgiven Student Loans From Taxes
In a decision that will bring relief to tens of thousands of student loan borrowers, the Internal Revenue Service has expanded the pool of people who will not have to pay taxes on the balance of their forgiven loans.
The I.R.S. said its ruling would provide “appropriate” relief to borrowers by waiving taxes on both federal and private loans that are forgiven because their schools misled them or closed abruptly. Such borrowers could otherwise be left with cripplingly high tax bills.
