These Godiva Chocolates Are Meant for Home Cooks
Those chocolate-dipped strawberries at Godiva have long been a popular gift. The companyâ€™s new line of chocolate products for home cooks includes little semisweet or milk chocolate tablets, specially formulated for melting, so you can coat your own fruit. For a more generous chocolate hit, you could also use them in chocolate chip cookies. There are also sacks of chips and 4-ounce blocks for baking in bittersweet, semisweet and milk, and also good-quality unsweetened chocolate.
