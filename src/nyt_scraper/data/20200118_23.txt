Variety: Acrostic
ACROSTIC — I remark on this once in a while, and I’ll say it again: I really owe Team Cox/Rathvon a big thank you for providing reading recommendations. As smug and clever as I feel when I recognize a writer after solving (or, as proof of genius, once or twice recognizing an actual passage), it’s better for me and for all of us to discover new and interesting writers through solving these puzzles.
That said, I hope I’m not the only one here who didn’t know who Will Cuppy is? He is the author of this passage, which comes from a 1941 book called “The Great Bustard and Other People,” which was illustrated by the famous New Yorker cartoonist and creator of “Shrek,” William Steig.
Will Cuppy looks like a fascinating piece of work. A brief glance at his anecdotal history has him living in solitude for eight years in a shack on an island off Jones Beach (and writing “How to Be a Hermit”), and finding a different sort of regular refuge at the Bronx Zoo, which inspired satirical essays and articles that were compiled into this excerpt’s book as well as others, like “How to Tell Your Friends From the Apes” and “How to Become Extinct.”
As far as the excerpt we have to solve, we’re given a slew of tip-off clues today. What do you get when you consider C S LEWIS, EYE TEETH, THROATY, AFROBEAT and WIMOWEH?
Add ETOSHA, where the gray rhebok (or REEBOK, why not) roam, cautiously; you must be thinking lions, which are the inspiration for today’s passage. Frankly, I was reminded more of going to the dog park and getting wiped out in a spectacular fashion by a whirling mob of enthusiastic doodles and schnoodles, which onlookers find simply hilarious.
I don’t think the cluing was that hard today, nor were there lengthy or difficult terms in the excerpt. ISLAND HOP was a brilliant pun, and everything else was breezy and fun.
