The Campaign to Redefine ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’
Merriam-Webster added “Chinese restaurant syndrome” to its dictionaries in 1993. The definition described symptoms affecting “susceptible persons eating food and especially Chinese food heavily seasoned with monosodium glutamate.”
The entry came decades after a physician, Robert Ho Man Kwok, wrote The New England Journal of Medicine to describe an unusual malady. Whenever he ate at a Chinese restaurant, he said, he felt a peculiar numbness.
