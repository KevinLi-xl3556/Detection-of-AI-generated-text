Corrections: Jan. 7, 2020
An article on Saturday about the decision by President Trump to order the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani misspelled the given name of the defense secretary. He is Mark T. Esper, not Marc.
An article on Saturday about threats exchanged between the United States and Iran after the death of General Suleimani described incorrectly the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. It was approved by Congress to grant legal authority to wage war in Iraq, not to enable military action against Al Qaeda.
An article on Sunday about the effect the conflict with Iran will have on the fight against ISIS misstated the occupation of the American whose killing helped precipitate the United States’ strike on Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. The American was a civilian contractor, not a soldier.
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the Department of Homeland Security’s assessment of potential threats from Iran misstated the name of the department’s transportation agency. It is the Transportation Security Administration, not the Transportation Security Agency.
An article on Saturday about the endurance of the car-buying boom in the United States misidentified the Michigan hometown of Pete Krupsky, a used-car buyer. It is Rockwood, not Rosewood.
An entry in the Listings pages on Friday about television to watch this winter misstated the director of the “68 Whiskey” pilot. It is Michael Lehmann, not Ron Howard; Howard is an executive producer.
