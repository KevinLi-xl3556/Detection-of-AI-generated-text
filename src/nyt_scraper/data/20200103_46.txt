The New #TheStew
Hello you, hello 2020, and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes. We can now get back to blessedly normal cooking, not event cooking, or showstopping cooking, or let-me-just-feed-all-these-people-in-my-home cooking.
It’s also a prime opportunity to establish a new normal, which is where Melissa Clark comes in. Her latest column, “The Meat-Lover’s Guide to Eating Less Meat,” brims with sane and very delicious strategies for reducing your meat consumption, if that’s a goal of yours for reasons ethical or environmental, or for your health. (It’s a goal of mine.)
Two of Melissa’s excellent new recipes are below, though not the one I am most excited to try: mushroom Bourguignon, which is more of a Sunday night affair than a Wednesday night grind. Still, try it. Also send me ideas, tips and thoughts at dearemily@nytimes.com. I love to hear from you.

Here are five dishes for the week:
1. Spicy White Bean Stew With Broccoli Rabe
I loved Alison Roman’s new column, with its admission that she sometimes feels no inspiration whatsoever in the kitchen. But then she gives us this recipe, which our beloved video producer and Instagram influencer Vaughn Vreeland has called #TheStewpoint0 after our national dish, which is also by Alison. Lately, I’ve been subbing in cauliflower florets for some of the chickpeas when I make that original stew, just to get more vegetables in, and I’m going to do that here too. Adding a bit of sausage or bacon is also a strong choice.

2. Chicken Puttanesca

I can’t resist the shmaltzy, briny pairing of chicken and olives; the addition of tomatoes, capers and anchovies puts this recipe even further over the edge for me. Serve this with egg noodles or pasta, alongside something green.

3. Orecchiette With Corn, Jalapeño, Feta and Basil
Yes, I’m giving you a summery corn recipe in midwinter; this is intentional. My friend Scout, who calls this elote pasta, just made it using frozen sweet corn, adding chorizo, lemon and Parmesan, and doubling the jalapeño. She relayed this to me, and I thought it sounded so much like something that you’d want to eat in the grayest time of the year that here I am now, relaying it to you.

4. Roasted Vegan Sausages With Cauliflower and Olives
Lately I’ve received emails from readers and friends who wanted recipes in which they could swap in plant-based meat for actual meat. I sent them to this Italian wedding soup, to chili and to tacos. Now Melissa has two new dishes using plant-based meat: this salty-sweet sausage recipe, and the meatless meatballs in marinara sauce here. It’s not exactly in keeping with the spirit of the exercise, but if you had regular meaty sausage and wanted an excellent sheet-pan dinner, you can use that here.

5. Black Bean Tacos With Avocado and Spicy Onions
This is a superb way to do a vegetarian taco night, with chili-ish black beans wrapped in flour tortillas and adorned with pickled onions. You don’t have to use jalapeño in those onions if that doesn’t work for you, but I strongly urge you not to skip the onions altogether; that’s the little touch that make these shine. Lay it all out on the table with as many toppings as you can muster: cilantro, sour cream, cheese, salsa.
