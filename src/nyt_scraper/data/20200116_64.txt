‘Distances’ Review: Fumblingly Picking at the Knot of Race
“When did you first realize that you were white?”
In “Distances Smaller Than This Are Not Confirmed,” David Neumann and Marcella Murray’s quiet, experimental dialogue about race, the question comes up again and again — she, a young black woman, posing it to him, a middle-aged white man who cannot answer it. Not that he doesn’t try, grasping for childhood anecdotes like the time in second grade that he mispronounced Niger and spurred a classroom lecture on civil rights.
When did Murray first realize she was black? Neumann asks, and her answer is instantaneous, her calm certainty in perfect counterpoint to his squirming self-consciousness.
