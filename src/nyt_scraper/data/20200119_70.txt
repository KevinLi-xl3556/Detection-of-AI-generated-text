Emily Kaplan, David Rosenberg
Emily Alice Kaplan and David Zvi Rosenberg are to be married Jan. 19 at 99 Scott, an events space in Brooklyn. Rabbi Robert N. Levine is to officiate and lead the ceremony with Rabbi Dr. Reuven Leigh.
Ms. Kaplan, 32, is a vice president and a specialist in the postwar and contemporary art department at Christie’s New York. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is the daughter of Sally Grueskin Kaplan of Manhattan, and the late Peter J. Kaplan. The bride’s father was a founder and the president of National Media Group, a sports marketing firm that was in Manhattan. Her mother is the director of What Matters, an advanced care planning initiative, focusing on the Jewish community in New York City.
Mr. Rosenberg, 30, is a vice president for business and corporate development at Giphy, a Manhattan-based search engine for animated GIFs (short video clips used to express emotion or reaction). He is the president of the board of Tech Kids Unlimited, a nonprofit based in Brooklyn focusing on teaching computer skills to children with autism in New York City. He graduated from Cambridge University.
He is the son of Helena Rosenberg and Daniel P. Rosenberg of the Chigwell, Essex, England. The groom’s mother retired as a teacher at St. Aubyn’s School, a coed preparatory school in Woodford Green, England. His father is a partner in the London law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.
The couple were introduced in January 2014 through Gaby Stern, a friend of Ms. Kaplan’s, who met Mr. Rosenberg, who lived in London at the time, at an event for an app launch in Manhattan. A few weeks later Ms. Kaplan, who lived in Manhattan, met Mr. Rosenberg at a restaurant in Brooklyn. They kept in touch and saw each other when he would spend a few weeks in town on business. She said Mr. Rosenberg seemed like a real mensch to her particularly after she noticed he frequently called his grandmothers.
