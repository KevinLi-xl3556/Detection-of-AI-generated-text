Corrections: Jan. 28, 2020
An article on Monday about the purchase of newspapers by hedge funds misstated the name of the institution where Ann Marie Lipinski is the curator. It is the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, not the Nieman Center for Journalism.
An article on Friday about the rivalry between Connecticut and Tennessee’s women’s basketball teams described incorrectly the 1997 N.C.A.A. tournament game in which Tennessee beat Connecticut. It was in Iowa City, not Cincinnati, and the game was a regional final, not a national semifinal.
An article on Sunday about Kobe Bryant’s legacy with the  Los Angeles Lakers described incorrectly LeBron James’s team affiliation at the time of Mr. Bryant’s Oscar acceptance speech in March 2018. James was in his final season with the Cleveland Cavaliers; he was not “already a Laker.”
A theater review about “Grand Horizons” misstated the number of cast members in the play. There are seven cast members, not six.
An Editorial Observer on Sunday about the Supreme Court agreeing to hear two cases involving the voting obligations of members of the Electoral College said no Republican electors had joined the Democratic-led effort to keep Donald Trump from taking the White House in 2016. One elector, from Texas, did.
An obituary on Jan. 17 about Christopher Tolkien, the son of the writer J.R.R. Tolkien, using information from the Tolkien Society, misstated the day he died. It was Thursday, Jan. 16 — not Wednesday, Jan. 15.
