A Chef Designs Shelf-Stable Meals for the Needy
The chef John Doherty, who once ran the kitchens at the Waldorf Astoria and is now an owner of the Black Barn Restaurant, has created meals for the needy. After 18 months of work, he has designed shelf-stable meal pouches, each containing a main dish with at least 20 grams of protein. Among them are three-bean chili and red beans and rice with chicken. They can be warmed in a microwave or in boiling water (or even eaten straight out of the package at room temperature). Theyâ€™re very tasty and made without preservatives. He distributes them through the Heavenly Harvst Foundation, which works with the nonprofit Feed the Children, to give 50,000 of the meals to families in New York, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago.
