Patrick Cantlay, Once a Star Amateur, Aims for the Top
Patrick Cantlay has not generated as much attention as some other golfers in their 20s, but that might change soon.
Cantlay, 27, of the United States, who will make his European Tour debut at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, is ranked No. 6 in the world. He was the top-ranked amateur in the world and tied for 21st at the 2011 United States Open at the age of 19. He is coming off a 3-2 performance in the United States triumph over the International Team at the Presidents Cup in December and finished fourth this month at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii.
