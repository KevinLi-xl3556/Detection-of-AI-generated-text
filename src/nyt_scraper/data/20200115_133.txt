Nissan Is in Trouble. Carlos Ghosn May Deserve the Blame.
Carlos Ghosn was long one of the most admired executives in the auto industry.
He was hailed as a corporate savior when the French automaker Renault bought a stake in Nissan and dispatched him to Japan on a rescue mission. He built a thriving global alliance between the two companies, and for 12 years he led both simultaneously.
“Carlos Ghosn did some great things,” said Scott Smith, the owner of four Nissan franchises in Georgia. “He gave us a lot of good product. He was the Lee Iacocca of Europe.”
