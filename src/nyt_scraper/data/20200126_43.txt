Two Dead in Shooting in South Carolina
Two men were killed and at least four other people were wounded in a shooting early Sunday morning at a bar in South Carolina, according to the authorities.
The shooting took place at Mac’s Lounge in Hartsville, according to the Darlington County coroner, Todd Hardee.
“A person did all this shooting,” Mr. Hardee said in an interview. “We are still trying to figure it out.” The two men died at the scene, he said.
The authorities said on Monday that two people had been arrested in connection with the shooting.
One man, Darius Grant Dickey, was charged with four counts of attempted murder and several other charges, said Lauren Baker, a spokeswoman for the Hartsville Police Department. A judge denied bail for him, she said.
A second person was in custody but had not yet been charged, she added.
The motive for the shooting remained under investigation.
The victims, who were not immediately publicly identified, were taken to Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center in Hartsville and McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, Mr. Hardee said. A spokeswoman for McLeod referred inquiries about victims’ conditions to the Hartsville police. A spokeswoman for Carolina Pines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several orange cones dotted the exterior of the club, according to footage from the television station WPDE. A sign outside the bar, which is near Coker University, says it has been open since 1966.
Agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the United States Marshals Service were assisting with the investigation, Ms. Baker said.
Hartsville, a city of 7,500 residents, is about 23 miles northwest of Florence.
“Our city is a close-knit community but, more than that, it is a family,” Ms. Baker said. “We are broken-hearted by this terrible news.”
