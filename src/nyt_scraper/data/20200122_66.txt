Today on “The Choice,” the endorsement podcast from NYT Opinion, New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang’s visit to the Times boardroom for his endorsement interview. The editorial board pressed him on his (oddly) regressive economic proposals, his history in college test prep and how he’d take on Silicon Valley monopolies. Plus: aliens, Shane Gillis and why no one wants to work for the N.S.A.

Then, tune in to the bonus deliberation episode, below, to hear the board’s reaction to Yang’s interview, and a deeper conversation with Mara Gay about how age — of candidates and their voters — is playing a role in the 2020 election.

A limited-run, twice-daily podcast that brings you inside the Times boardroom with the primary election candidates on the job interview of a lifetime. In the weekdays leading up to the Iowa caucuses, the editorial board is releasing a different Democratic candidate’s private endorsement interview, as well as a bonus episode featuring the board’s deliberation and a deep dive into an important aspect of the 2020 race. Our finale, on Jan. 30, will take you through the board’s consideration of each candidate and an explanation as to why it came to its final decision.
Watch the board come to its decision on the Jan. 19 episode of “The Weekly,” available on FX and Hulu, and in these areas outside the U.S.
The New York Times editorial board is made up of opinion journalists who rely on research, debate and individual expertise to reach a shared view of important issues. The board does not speak for the newsroom or The Times as a whole. Rather, amid the contending individual voices of Times Opinion, it aims to provide a consistent, independent view of the world based on time-tested institutional values.
