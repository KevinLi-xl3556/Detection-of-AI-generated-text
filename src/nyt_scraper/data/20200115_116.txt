Caddies Push for a Share of Sponsorship Money
Top professional golfers can make considerably more from endorsements than they ever could on the course.
Take Justin Rose, the British golfer who is ranked ninth in the world. He won more than $4 million last season. Yet Morgan Stanley paid him $5 million to wear its name on his hat, while his golf shirt has logos from Mastercard on his collar and Bonobos, the clothing company, and the Zurich Insurance Group on each sleeve.
