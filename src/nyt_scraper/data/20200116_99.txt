TV Cameras Coming to English Criminal Courts
LONDON — High-profile criminal cases in English and Welsh courts will be partially televised for the first time, the British Ministry of Justice said on Thursday, in a move that was welcomed by broadcasters but that drew caution from lawyers’ organizations.
The change is a limited one. Cameras will be present to record only judges’ sentencing remarks in crown courts, which handle more serious criminal offenses, including the Old Bailey, the main criminal court in London. Defendants, jurors, lawyers, victims and witnesses will remain strictly out of shot.
