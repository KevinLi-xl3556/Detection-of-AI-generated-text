NEAL Cassady was one of the most prominent members of the Beat literary movement in the 1950s and ’60s, although he never published a book. Instead, he acted as a muse to Beat leaders such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, and appeared as a main character in some of their novels.
Mr. Kerouac immortalized his cross-country adventures with Mr. Cassady in his 1957 novel “On the Road,” which was heavily influenced by the way Cassady talked and communicated in letters to Kerouac. The Beat Museum said that Cassady spoke “in a rush of mad ecstasy, without self-consciousness or mental hesitation,” and Kerouac’s change of style helped the book become a sensation.
Later in life, Cassady took off on a new series of adventures with the novelist Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters. Cassady took the wheel of a psychedelic bus named Further, and the resulting LSD-fueled trip to the New York World’s Fair was chronicled in Tom Wolfe’s “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.”
