The Drama Within the Royal Family
To the Editor:
Re “Gone With the Windsors,” by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 12):
Calling on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to rise above racist taunts as the Obamas did totally misses the sad and tragic point. British tabloids are notoriously vicious and personal, nothing like American newspapers of record. Nobody should be forced to live with such daily abuse.
Princess Diana faced much the same thing, without the racist twist, and found it unbearable. The Windsors did nothing to protect her from the tidal wave of defamatory distortions and outright lies flowing nonstop from these loathsome rags.
