Love and Chocolates, Jean-Georges
No matter what, a box of chocolates still has merit as a Valentine’s Day gift. One option this year comes from the kitchens of Jean-Georges Vongerichten. A box of 12 bonbons (or 24), liberally decorated with hearts and flowers and made from organic single-origin chocolate, is now available to order online for pick up from Feb. 7 to 14 at many of Mr. Vongerichten’s restaurants. Inventive fillings include sesame crunch; toasted corn; vanilla and sour cherry; nougat; and raspberry rose.
