Lorenza Mazzetti, Wartime Survivor and Seminal Filmmaker, Dies at 92
Lorenza Mazzetti, who as a child in Italy survived the wartime killings of her caretaker family by German soldiers and went on to help create an influential British film movement and write a prizewinning novel based on her experiences, died on Jan. 4 in Rome. She was 92.
The death was confirmed by her twin sister, Paola Mazzetti.
Ms. Mazzetti’s work spanned film, television, painting and book-writing; she even ran a popular puppet theater in Rome’s Campo de’ Fiori neighborhood in the 1980s. Her searing experience in World War II shaped her most acclaimed book, “Il Cielo Cade” (1961), a best seller that won Italy’s prestigious Viareggio Prize. It was published in English the next year as “The Sky Falls.”
