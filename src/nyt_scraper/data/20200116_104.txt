I Thought This Was an All-Inclusive Resort
My husband and I took our family to a resort hotel in Hawaii. After leaving the pool one afternoon, I realized I had left my hat on a chaise. So, I dumped my stuff in my room and trekked back to the pool. The pool attendant had put my hat in the towel hut. I thanked him. He replied: “‘Thank you’ doesn’t pay the bills, ma’am.” I shrugged to show him I had nothing but my room key. When I told the story later, my husband thought I should go back the next day with a $5 tip. My daughter-in-law thought I should report him for rudeness. And the others said: Let it go. That’s what I did, deciding that the $100 per room resort fee covered this. Thoughts?
SALLY
Of course the pool attendant broke protocol by speaking so candidly to a guest. But if I’m candid — and picture a person earning minimum wage (plus tips) by laying down towels for people with hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a night to spend on hotel rooms — I bet that tamping down resentment is an occasional feature of his job.
