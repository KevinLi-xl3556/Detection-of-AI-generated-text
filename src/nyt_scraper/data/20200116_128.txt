In Huawei Battle, China Threatens Germany ‘Where It Hurts’: Automakers

“There is nothing like seeing in practice what’s possible,” Ms. Merkel beamed when they returned.
That was July 2018, when economic cooperation between the two countries looked limitless — combining Germany’s powerful auto industry and China’s technology giant, Huawei.
