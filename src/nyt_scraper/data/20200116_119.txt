‘VHYes’ Review: Channel Surfing and Self-Soothing
“VHYes” is barely 72 minutes long, but that’s just one reason this outlandish picture barely qualifies as a feature. For one thing, it’s almost halfway through before anything approximating a story emerges; even then, it’s such a pale, sickly thing you’d be forgiven for thinking you had imagined it.
Set at the tail end of 1987 and shot entirely on VHS and Betamax tape — a gimmick your eyeballs are unlikely to appreciate — this rough, at times sophomoric comedy from Jack Henry Robbins shoots for satire and lands mostly on inanity. Unfolding as a series of fragmented sketches apparently strung together at random, the movie forces us to watch as 12-year-old Ralph (Mason McNulty) uses his new camcorder — and his parents’ wedding video — to tape his late-night channel surfing.
