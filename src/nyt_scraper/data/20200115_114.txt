When Pina Bausch Made Tanz Into Tanztheater
WUPPERTAL, Germany — The dancers lay in darkness on the floor of a studio here. Although a video was playing, they closed their eyes and focused on listening: to the fervent, intense voices of Bartok’s opera “Bluebeard’s Castle,” and to sounds of breathing, screaming, silence, laughter, sobbing and the sibilance of rustling leaves.
They were listening to a performance of Pina Bausch’s “Bluebeard. While Listening to a Tape Recording of Bela Bartok’s ‘Duke Bluebeard’s Castle,’” created in 1977 and not performed since 1994. For most of the dancers, almost half of whom joined the Wuppertal Tanztheater after Bausch’s death in 2009, these were the sounds of the past. They evoke a world of brutality and tenderness, irrationality and sadness, familiar to anyone who has seen Bausch’s powerfully dramatic, dreamlike works, which have come to define the genre of tanztheater, or dance theater, over the last 40 years.
