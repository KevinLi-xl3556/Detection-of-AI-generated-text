Corrections: Jan. 24, 2020
An article on Thursday about a new white supremacist group called the Base misstated the name of a Georgia county where three men cased a house of Antifa members. It is Bartow County, not Barstow County.
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a fire in Brooklyn that killed an 11-year-old girl referred incorrectly to Shomrei Hadas. Madelyn Novitsky, a substitute teacher, would sometimes take Shirr Teved to synagogue, but that synagogue was not Shomrei Hadas. Shomrei Hadas is the funeral home where Shirr’s funeral services were held.
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the soccer player Javier Hernández misstated the timing of David Beckham’s first season with the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer in relation to Landon Donovan’s. Beckham joined the team after Donovan did, not before.
