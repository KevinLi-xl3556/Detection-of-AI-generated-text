Georgian Rarities, Served Without Fanfare, at Chama Mama
Ekala is a prickly climber akin to North American greenbrier, often dismissed as a troublemaking weed. In the Imereti region of Georgia, its crisp young shoots are gathered in spring, before their thorns sharpen, when theyâ€™re as skinny and fragile as first asparagus, and pickled to last.
It rarely makes its way to New York, not even to the Georgian restaurants of southern Brooklyn, where thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet republic have settled in the past 30 years.
