Intelligence Officials Invited to Testify to House Amid Uncertainty
WASHINGTON — Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued invitations on Thursday to intelligence agency leaders to testify publicly in an effort to head off an attempt to move their yearly hearing on global threats behind closed doors.
Last year’s public hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee led to headlines about the officials’ disagreements with President Trump on key intelligence issues, which prompted Mr. Trump to lash out against them, suggesting on Twitter that the agency heads “go back to school.”
