The Misguided Push for an Equal Rights Amendment
A growing excitement surrounds Virginia’s vote this week to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, guaranteeing equal legal rights for all United States citizens regardless of sex. Virginia is the 38th state to ratify the E.R.A., pushing the country over the three-quarters threshold required for a constitutional amendment — assuming that the decisions of five states to rescind their ratification over the years don’t count.
Why is the E.R.A. gaining newfound momentum decades after the ratification deadline passed and initial momentum fizzled? Perhaps in the face of #MeToo and a misogynous president, we want an insurance policy, a stopgap for rights that seem to be constantly eroding. Understandable, no doubt. But as someone who has worked for equal rights for women for nearly 40 years and has tried to provide a clear description of the ways bias impacts women’s lives, I wonder whether the E.R.A. is the best fight to pick right now. Because make no mistake — it would be a battle. President Trump’s Department of Justice has already issued a 38-page opinion declaring the E.R.A. dead, dead, dead.
