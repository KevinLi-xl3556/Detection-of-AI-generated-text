Life in Tech’s ‘Uncanny Valley’

It’s early days, of course, but one of the year’s most acclaimed books is Anna Wiener’s memoir, “Uncanny Valley,” in which she recounts leaving her low-paying publishing job, at 25, for the tech industry and Silicon Valley, and the ensuing optimism and disenchantment she experienced.
“By the time I moved out to San Francisco, it felt like the party was in full swing,” Wiener says on this week’s podcast. “It didn’t feel like I was an early participant or that I was at the fore of anything. I felt very much that I was part of this wave of people who were looking for fulfillment or momentum in work. It wasn’t the promise of innovation or this idea of a future that didn’t yet exist. I think I arrived at this moment when the future was fully fledged. At the same time, it felt like start-up Disneyland to be out in San Francisco in 2013.”
Elisabeth Egan, an editor at the Book Review, visits the podcast this week to discuss Group Text, a new monthly column for readers and book clubs about the novels, memoirs and short-story collections that make you want to talk, ask questions and dwell in the book’s world for a little bit longer. Egan talks about the first pick, Liz Moore’s literary thriller “Long Bright River,” about two sisters who take very different paths through the wreckage of the opioid crisis.
Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Gregory Cowles, Tina Jordan and John Williams talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:
