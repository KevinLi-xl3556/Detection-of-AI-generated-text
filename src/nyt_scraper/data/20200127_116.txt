Lesson of the Day: ‘Emojis Meet Hieroglyphs: If King Tut Could Text’
Featured Article: “Emojis Meet Hieroglyphs: If King Tut Could Text” by Isabel Kershner.
A new exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem explores the complicated relationship between the hieroglyphs of antiquity and emoji, the lingua franca of the digital age.
In this lesson, you’ll compare these two sets of symbols to analyze this relationship. Then, you’ll try an emoji writing exercise to decide whether you think these pictograms, like hieroglyphs, can be considered their own language.
Take a look at these images from a museum exhibition called “Emoglyphs: Picture-Writing From Hieroglyphs to the Emoji.” On the left side you’ll find hieroglyphs, the language developed by ancient Egyptians 5,000 years ago, and on the right side you’ll see emojis.
Read the article, then answer the following questions:
1. What is the main idea of the museum exhibition “Emoglyphs: Picture-Writing From Hieroglyphs to the Emoji”?
2. In what ways are hieroglyphs and emojis similar?
3. In what important ways do they differ?
4. How can pictograms — whether hieroglyphs or emojis — sometimes be more meaningful than words alone? Give one example from the article.
5. Media literacy. What strategies does this museum exhibition use to help visitors connect the past to the present and understand the relationship between hieroglyphs and emojis?
6. Prof. Orly Goldwasser, head of Egyptology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that the advent of the alphabet was both “a great victory and a great loss.” What does she mean by that? Do you agree?
Some have hailed emoji as a new language, while others, like Prof. Chaim Noy, argue that calling emoji a language is too simplistic. What do you think?
Try this writing exercise from our recent Picture Prompt “A 📖 of Two 🏙”, which invites you to rewrite the first line of your favorite book using emojis. Take a look at the creations other students have posted in the comments to see whether you can figure out what they’re saying.
Then, reflect on the experience:
Do you agree? Why or why not?
