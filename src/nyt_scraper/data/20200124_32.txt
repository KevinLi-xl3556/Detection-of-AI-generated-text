Roxane Gay Revisits ‘Darkness’ as a Graphic Novel
The author Roxane Gay is making another foray into the world of graphic novels, with the publication in October of “The Sacrifice of Darkness,” an adaptation of one of her short stories. The fantasy is about a world that is cloaked in darkness when it loses its sun. Tracy Lynne Oliver is a co-writer of the book, which will be published by Archaia, an imprint of Boom! Studios. The artwork is by Rebecca Kirby, with colors by James Fenner.
In a telephone interview on Thursday, Gay said that she enjoyed collaborating with Oliver, her best friend. “She had smart things to say in the way she reimagined parts of my story,” she said. Originally published as “We Are the Sacrifice of Darkness”  in a 2013 short story anthology, the story then appeared as “The Sacrifice of Darkness” in her 2017 collection “Difficult Women.”
Gay also wrote World of Wakanda, a spinoff of Marvel’s Black Panther series, which she wrote with the poet Yona Harvey. For TKO Studios, she wrote The Banks, about three generations of black women pulling off a revenge heist.  
Gay noted the economy of language that is required for writing comics, given the limited number of words that can fit on a panel or page. “In many ways, it’s like Twitter,” she said. “You have to really think about what you want to say and why.”
