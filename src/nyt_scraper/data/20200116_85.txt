11 New Books We Recommend This Week
Ada Calhoun’s new book, “Why We Can’t Sleep,” focuses specifically on the midlife anxieties facing Gen X women — but a quick look at our other recommended titles this week may leave you wondering how any of us manage to get shut-eye. There’s a novel about a missing sister and the opioid crisis in Philadelphia (“Long Bright River”); a journalistic account of Detroit’s bankruptcy and its repercussions (“Broke”); a recap of Brett Kavanaugh’s troubled and polarizing path to the Supreme Court (“Supreme Ambition”); and an intimate portrayal of the ravages facing the working poor (“Tightrope”).
It’s not all bad news, though. The poet Danez Smith offers an exhilarating tribute to friends in a new collection, “Homie.” Marcia Chatelain explores the complicated relationship — for better and worse — between McDonald’s and black communities, in “Franchise.” Two novels delve into continents and communities on the threshold of change: Johannes Anyuru’s “A Storm Blew In From Paradise” tackles postcolonial politics in East Africa, and Niall Williams’s “This Is Happiness” looks at an Irish village just before modernity intrudes. And two biographies shed new light on venerable authors, Carol Sklenicka’s “Alice Adams” and Gillian Gill’s “Virginia Woolf.”
