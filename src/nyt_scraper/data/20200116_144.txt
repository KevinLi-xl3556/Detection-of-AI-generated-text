How to Get Rid of 9,000 Tons of Toxic Topsoil
Dylan Sharbonier and two other construction workers were hanging a green tarp on the fence surrounding one of 13 lead-tainted ball fields in Red Hook, Brooklyn, this month, their fingers red from below-freezing temperatures.
“We need to get these fields open by spring,” Mr. Sharbonier said. “The kids need these fields.”
Locals are more circumspect. Wally Bazemore, who grew up nearby in the Red Hook Houses and coached baseball here for years, said he would be thrilled to see the fields open soon. “But I doubt they’re going to be open for summer,” he said. “We won’t see any baseball until 2021. And that’s if they do it right. And we want them to do it right.”
