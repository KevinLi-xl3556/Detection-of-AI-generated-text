Adam Schiff: Former Prosecutor Who Led Inquiry Will Helm Impeachment Team
WASHINGTON — As a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles 30 years ago, Adam B. Schiff won the conviction of an F.B.I. agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for gold and cash — a case, he said then, “of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order.”
Mr. Schiff is now a 10th-term Democratic House member and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and he soon may find himself repeating that sentiment, this time as the lead House manager in the impeachment trial of President Trump.
