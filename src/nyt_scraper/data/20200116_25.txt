8 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend
Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ORAN ETKIN at the Jewish Museum (Jan. 19, 11:30 a.m.). A jazz artist, Etkin hardly goes anywhere without his good friend Clara. She happens to be very talkative, even though she’s not, strictly speaking, a person: She’s his clarinet or, as he calls her, Clara Net. Etkin, who developed the children’s educational program Timbalooloo, which presents melody as a conversation among instruments, will appear with his band at the Jewish Museum, where he will show just how fluent Clara is in world languages. The program will include excerpts from his latest album, “Finding Friends Far From Home: A Journey With Clara Net,” in which she makes acquaintances like the mbira in Zimbabwe and the samisen in Japan. Etkin will also perform at National Sawdust on Feb. 1 as part of the monthly Timbalooloo Jazz for Kids Duo Series. In those programs, Clara usually chats with just one of her peers. This session will feature a kora from Mali, to be played by Yacouba Sissoko.
