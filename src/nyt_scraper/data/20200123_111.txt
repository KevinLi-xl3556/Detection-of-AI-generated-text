Annotated by the Author: ‘Tiny Tyrannosaur Hints at How T. Rex Became King’
As part of our Mentor Text series, we’re trying something new: Inviting Times journalists to annotate their own articles to help demystify the research and writing process.
This, our first edition, was chosen in honor of our new STEM writing contest, which challenges students to choose an issue or question in science, technology, engineering, math or health that interests them, and then write a 500-word explanation that will engage and enlighten readers.
We've invited Nicholas St. Fleur, a science reporter who often writes for the Trilobites column, to take us behind the scenes of his short piece “Tiny Tyrannosaur Hints at How T. Rex Became King.”
Excerpts from his original article are in bold, below, reproduced exactly as he wrote it, with the hyperlinks intact. Following each bolded section are Mr. St. Fleur’s comments about the word choices he made, whom he interviewed and why, and how science journalism works in general.
If you and your students find this new annotation feature useful, please let us know in the comments or by writing to LNFeedback@nytimes.com. We are considering asking other Times journalists to do the same.
If you’d like to hear more from Mr. St. Fleur, and from fellow science writer James Gorman, you might be interested in our on-demand webinar, Teaching With The Science Times.
And, again, if you and your students found this useful, please let us know. We are thinking of asking other Times journalists to do the same. Write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, or leave a comment, and thank you!
