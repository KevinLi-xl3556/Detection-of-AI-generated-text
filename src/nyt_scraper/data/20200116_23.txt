F.B.I. Vows to Notify State Officials of Any Election Systems Breaches
WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. said on Thursday that it would now notify state officials about attacks on their election systems, a shift designed to help elections officials handle potential hacks as the nation braces itself for digital attacks on all fronts in the run-up to this year’s election.
The F.B.I. has long only informed local election officials who run voting systems of breaches and expected them to keep quiet. Now the bureau will notify state officials responsible for certifying elections so they avoid doing so in cases where votes may have been knowingly tampered with.
