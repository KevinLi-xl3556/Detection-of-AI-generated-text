When his older brother had a baby, Evan James felt a glimmer of competitive jealousy. Then, he remembered that he didn’t want children and, as far as he could tell, never would. So he decided to embrace being the “most doting and caricatured of family figures: the gay uncle.”
On this week’s Modern Love podcast, Tan France, the fashion adviser on “Queer Eye,” reads Mr. James’s essay, “A Role I Was Born to Play.”
Mr. France is the author of the memoir “Naturally Tan” and is a co-host of the new reality design competition show “Next in Fashion.” Mr. James is the author of the novel “Cheer Up, Mr. Widdicombe.” He writes and teaches in New York. Stay tuned after the reading to hear more from him, Mr. France and the Modern Love editor Daniel Jones.
