Andrew scooped this morning that Steph Korey, who stepped aside as the chief of the hip luggage maker last month amid controversy over her management style, will return as co-C.E.O.
Ms. Korey gave up her C.E.O. title after former employees told The Verge that she oversaw an abusive management system at Away, which created a firestorm on social media. She quickly apologized and said she would become executive chairman.
But she told Andrew that was a mistake. She decided to become co-C.E.O. alongside Stuart Haselden, who was meant to be the sole chief executive, because the company had let “inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had.”
The article “just created a misconception that she was exiting the business, which was never the intent,” Mr. Haselden added.
The Verge said it stood by its reporting, saying in a statement that Ms. Korey’s initial response “speaks for itself.”
It’s a rare attempt by a company — especially one whose success depended on social media buzz — to buck the online consensus. Whether it will backfire remains a question.
The common wisdom in Washington is that Michael Bloomberg has no shot at winning the Democratic presidential nomination. John Ellis, a former political columnist, writes in a WaPo op-ed that such thinking is wrong.
• “What people don’t yet seem to have grasped is this: Bloomberg is going to spend an astronomical amount of money on this race. Probably at least $1 billion. Maybe twice that. Possibly even more.”
• “Numbers like that upend every model of every presidential race in history. He can buy every news adjacency on cable and local television stations from now until November and not make a dent in his net worth.”
• “If Democrats nominate anyone besides Bloomberg, they will be outspent in the general election by 2 to 1 or even 3 to 1. If they nominate Bloomberg, he will outspend Trump at least 5 to 1.”
Right now, Mr. Bloomberg is polling fifth nationally among Democratic contenders, behind Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. (He entered the race in November.)
Also worth noting: Mr. Bloomberg has said he would continue spending to defeat President Trump even if he doesn’t get the nomination.
The carmakers are publicly committed to maintaining their union, in spite of the fissures that have emerged since the ouster of Carlos Ghosn as their leader. But Nissan management is working on a Plan B, the FT reports, citing unnamed sources.
• “The plans include war-gaming a total divide in engineering and manufacturing, as well as changes to Nissan’s board, according to several sources, and have been ramped up since Mr. Ghosn’s dramatic escape from Japan in late December.”
• The partnership has become “toxic,” two of the unnamed sources said. Many Nissan executives now reportedly believe “the French carmaker is a drag on its Japanese counterpart.”
But a divorce would create two smaller carmakers at a time when rivals are combining forces, the FT notes. Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot have agreed to merge, while Volkswagen and Ford are creating their own alliance.
With U.S. and Chinese officials preparing to sign a phase-one trade deal on Wednesday, the WSJ took a look at the toll of their bitter fight. It wasn’t widespread throughout the economy — but the full consequences may take years to play out.
• U.S. farm exports to China fell to as low as $7 billion from $25 billion in recent years, and farm debt soared to a new record. The agricultural sector relied on $28 billion in federal aid to survive.
• Foreign direct investment in the U.S. contracted sharply in 2018 and 2019.
• But inflation remained largely stable, and most of the U.S. economy now works in sectors largely unaffected directly by the trade fight.
Things could have been worse, but they could have been better, the WSJ writes. The economy grew just 2 percent, despite President Trump’s goal of 3 percent. And Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist for Oxford Economics, estimates that it could have grown 2.6 percent if the trade fight hadn’t happened.
“People are wanting to wrap this up in a bow and draw lessons and put this behind us, but I really think it’s way too premature,” Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics told the WSJ.
The Japanese tech giant’s chief, Masa Son, promised in 2016 to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. through his company’s huge investment fund, the Vision Fund. Jessica Lessin of The Information points out that SoftBank-backed companies are doing the opposite.
Last week alone, over 3,000 job cuts were announced at Vision Fund portfolio companies. They include Oyo, the Indian hotel start-up; Getaround, a car-sharing service; and Zume, a robotic pizza delivery company that now plans to get out of that business.
That’s on top of the 2,400 layoffs at WeWork announced in November.
The cuts are partly a result of SoftBank’s playbook, Ms. Lessin writes. The company gave start-ups huge sums of money and told them to grow at all costs — but expenses eventually swelled, and the growth slowed down. Contraction was inevitable. The model “never really made much sense to begin with,” she adds.
The contrary view: Analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent research note that they believe SoftBank is still the “Berkshire Hathaway of tech,” and will ultimately deliver “enormous long-term gains” for investors.
Yusaku Maezawa has a lot, including an estimated net worth of $3.6 billion and a ticket on SpaceX’s 2023 voyage to the moon. But he wants something else, according to Bloomberg: a companion.
• The former e-commerce entrepreneur tweeted a link yesterday to a website where women can apply to join him on the weeklong SpaceX flight. The post has been retweeted over 10,000 times, including by Elon Musk.
• “As feelings of loneliness and emptiness slowly begin to surge upon me, there’s one thing that I think about: Continuing to love one woman,” Mr. Maezawa said.
• But the process won’t be that intimate: He’s also commissioned a TV production company to shoot a documentary, “Full Moon Lovers,” about it.
