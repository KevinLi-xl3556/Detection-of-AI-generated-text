For Golfers, Qualifying School Opens the Door
The fastest way to get playing status on the European Tour is to make it through a gantlet of tournaments collectively known as Qualifying School, or Q School for short. Those who survived this season’s version are scheduled to tee it up this week at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship.
The final stage of Q School, consisting of six rounds over six days, was played in November at the Lumine Golf Club in Spain. As it does every year, the school produced career-making success and soul-crushing defeat to determine which 25 players — out of the initial 1,063 hopefuls from 50 countries — get to join the existing members of the European Tour.
