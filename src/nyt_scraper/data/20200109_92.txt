The Most Popular Words in Real Estate Listings
We’ve all seen the common words and phrases that real estate listings use to get our attention: “Natural light.” “Stainless steel appliances.” “Move-in ready.” They’re critical not just for maximizing the number of potential buyers, but for luring the right buyers to any particular listing.
So what are real estate’s most popular keywords? To find out, Point2 Homes, a real estate listing website, analyzed the language in 1.2 million listings that were active in July 2019 across the United States.
“Large,” “new,” and “spacious” were among the most common adjectives used in listings, while “cul-de-sac,” and “close to restaurants and shopping” were frequently used for locations. The study also looked at keywords describing a home’s features and broke down the results by price range. The top 10 keywords in each of five price brackets make up this week’s chart.
For homes priced under $250,000, keywords addressing concerns about post-purchase expenses made frequent appearances, with “new roof” and “move-in ready” among the most used terms. Between $250,000 and $499,999, the prevalence of “dual sinks” and “covered patio” suggested buyers expect more than the basics. Between $500,000 and $999,999, aspirational terms like “perfect location” and “gourmet kitchen” crept into the top 10.
Between $1,000,000 and $4,999,999, there was a pivot from “gourmet” to the superior “chef kitchen.” Other cushy features, like “pool and spa” and “wet bar,” also appeared in the top 10. At the high end of the market — properties listed at $5,000,000 or more — were promises of “ocean views,” a “wine cellar” or a “media room.”
There was one common thread across the prince ranges, a single phrase that appeared in the top 10 of all available homes. Perhaps you guessed it: “hardwood floors.”
