Poem: The Far Norway Maples
Where do shining images take us? Arthur Sze’s 10th book of poems, “Sight Lines,” was selected as the National Book Award winner for poetry in 2019. Unusual verbs (spore, tumors) ignite his lines. A moment of visual precision, then a rippling out of thought-waves, breath. The reader, both rooted and released by the ending, feels the shimmer of refreshment in a moment’s gaze and possibilities: how any precise focus and pause affects us in its immediacy, then widens — and holds.

By Arthur Sze
Silver poplars rise and thin to the very twig,
but what thins at your fingertips?

The aspirations of a minute, a day, a year?
Yellow tangs veer in the water and, catching

sunlight, veer again, disappear from sight.
The unfolding of a life has junctures

that rupture plot: a child folds paper
and glues toothpicks, designs a split-level

house with white walls and pitched roof
but his father snatches the maquette

and burns it. If you inhale and spore this moment,
it tumors your body, but if you exhale it,

you dissolve midnight and noon; sunlight
tilts and leafs the tips of the far Norway maples.
