Why Did the Woman’s Finger Turn Numb and Blue?
‘‘What do you think of this?’’ the 54-year-old woman asked her friend, who happened to be a doctor. They were at a popular bakery in downtown New Haven, Conn., on a Saturday afternoon making cupcakes with a church group they belonged to. All of a sudden, the woman noticed that the middle finger on her right hand had gone completely numb. She looked down and saw that the palm side of her finger looked bruised at the base. ‘‘It doesn’t hurt, it’s just numb,’’ she said. ‘‘I don’t think I banged it on anything.’’
The doctor, a pediatrician, peered at her hand. ‘‘Hmm,’’ he mumbled thoughtfully. The skin beyond the bruising looked normal and pink. It wasn’t swollen, though it was a little cooler than the other fingers. He pressed on the nail, and the skin underneath turned white. He let go, and it turned pink again. He wasn’t sure what it was, he told her, but if it swelled up or got worse, he thought she should probably go to the E.R.
