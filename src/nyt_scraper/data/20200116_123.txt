Coco Gauff Will Have a Familiar First-Round Opponent: Venus Williams
MELBOURNE, Australia â€” In only her third Grand Slam event, Coco Gauff has challenges lined up that will already be familiar to her, as revealed in the Australian Open draw ceremony on Thursday evening.
Gauff, 15, will open in the first round against seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams, 39, as she did in the first round of Wimbledon last year. Gauff, then ranked outside the Top 300, became an international sensation by beating Williams, a five-time Wimbledon champion, 6-4, 6-4. Gauff backed up the win with a run to the fourth round, where she lost to the eventual champion, Simona Halep.
