This Is the Best Roast Chicken
Good morning. Melissa Clark came in this week with a beautiful new recipe for crisp-skinned Parmesan-rosemary roast chicken (above). My guess? It’s all anyone in your set will be talking about in coming days. I think you’ll want to make it tonight, or on some evening very soon. Go to!
Alan Richman, meanwhile, gave us a profile of the great chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and it’s a joy to read for the writing and the subject matter combined. The article sent me deep into NYT Cooking to learn what Vongerichten recipes we have on hand — J.G.V.s, some of us call those recipes, elegant and easy all at once. Many of them were developed with our old colleague Mark Bittman, with whom Vongerichten collaborated on a number of cookbooks.
