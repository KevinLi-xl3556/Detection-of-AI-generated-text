Derrick Henry Leads the Titans’ Run-More Rebellion
In the last 50 years, the N.F.L. has evolved from primitive roots that celebrated running plays known as “3 yards and a cloud of dust” to a contemporary aerial circus in which passing the football is the priority. Quarterbacks have become the rock stars of this modern football universe, and rare is a running back now valued with an early selection in the college draft (less than 5 percent of recent top-20 picks).
But in this month’s N.F.L. playoffs, someone forgot to tell the Tennessee Titans and their indomitable running back Derrick Henry that the game revolves around a pass-first mentality. In a twist, Henry’s unstoppable, record-breaking rushing performances have not only bucked the prevailing model, they have also catapulted the upstart Titans to back-to-back upset victories that upended the N.F.L.’s established power structure.
