John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, has a forthcoming book that corroborates impeachment allegations made against President Trump. On Monday, the late-night hosts took odds on the likelihood of hearing his testimony during the impeachment trial, or just reading about it in his “perfectly timed” book if Republicans block him as a witness.
Some late-night hosts dedicated part of their monologues to Kobe Bryant, who, along with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven other people died in a helicopter crash. Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel both grew teary-eyed when recalling their personal friendships with the basketball star.
James Corden paid tribute to Bryant as a family man and devoted father, while Conan O’Brien showed the best bits from some of Bryant’s appearances.
Magic Johnson will stop by “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Tuesday, where it is likely that he’ll talk about Bryant, a close friend and fellow Laker.
“American Dirt” is a best seller and the latest selection for Oprah’s Book Club, but its author, Jeanine Cummins, is under fire for writing a migrant story that some readers are calling “trauma porn.”
