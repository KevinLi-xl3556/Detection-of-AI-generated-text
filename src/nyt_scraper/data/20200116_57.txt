Did ‘Marriage Story’ Hit Close to Home? Tell Us Your Story
This week, Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” received six Oscar nominations, including for best actor (Adam Driver) and best actress (Scarlett Johansson). In the movie, “an amicable split becomes a shattering rupture,” A.O. Scott writes in his review. “What is happening is catastrophic, ridiculous and also — as the lawyers know — perfectly ordinary.”
For readers who have watched the movie, we’re curious what the experience was like if you’ve gone through a divorce or if you grew up with divorced parents. If you’re married and watched it with your spouse — and are still recovering — we’d love to hear from you too.
