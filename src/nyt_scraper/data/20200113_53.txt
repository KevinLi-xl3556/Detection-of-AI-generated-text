A Nice Price for Truffled Pasta and Wine
Those who have not already embarked on a New Year’s regimen of cucumbers and seltzer can still partake of a holiday-style meal at Bar Pleiades on the Upper East Side. For the month of January at lunch and dinner, the bar offers a plate of creamy wild mushroom fettuccine, showered with fresh black truffles at the table, and a generous glass of silky 2014 Joseph Drouhin Santenay alongside for $45. Some oysters first? Molten chocolate cake after? They can also be had for an additional charge. The food comes from the kitchen of Café Boulud across the hall.
