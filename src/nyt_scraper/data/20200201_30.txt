Variety: Acrostic
ACROSTIC — Today’s excerpt is by Rachel Carson, the 20th-century nature writer whose brilliant “Silent Spring” greatly contributed to the modern environmental movement. Her work also foreshadowed many of the predicaments we find ourselves in today on our beautiful and fragile planet. The passage is from a different work, “(The) Sense of Wonder,” which was originally a 1950s magazine article presented as a way for adults to foster a sensitivity to nature in children.
The passage concerns the rhythms of life, events that we can depend upon to occur in certain orders: the tides and the sunrise are two examples, as are seasons and the flight patterns of birds. Decades on, it seems designed to soothe a worried mind watching bizarre and unheard-of climate events occur daily, as well as to remind us all that we’re creatures of habit too, reliant on the mechanics of nature to tell us what to do. We just have to listen.
Speaking of listening, I felt that Team Cox/Rathvon was sending signals in its cluing today, but I couldn’t really piece them together. This was a pretty slow solve for me — I got NANETTE, RAMIS, CATNAP, CHER and AEGEAN right off the bat, but couldn’t really scrape together any other entries without some lengthy mulling. I think that WEATHER, ORBIT, REBIRTH, EAST WIND and ETERNITY all worked nicely with the passage, and there were some other nods to natural forces.
I had “oddball” for OFFBEAT, my only misdirect, and really loved the clue for EMERGENT. I will say that this puzzle had me pining for spring, although it’s just now February. That might be the toughest part of the solve today!
If you’re interested in a macroscopic view of bird migration in the New World, this is a one-year look at these movements (based on a decade’s worth of data from a number of tagged birds).
