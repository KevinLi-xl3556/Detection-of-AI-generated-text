Mayor de Blasio Offers ‘Minimalist’ $95.3 Billion Budget, Warning of Cuts
The divide between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has colored many city vs. state squabbles, seeping into disputes over subway repairs, school funding and solving the homelessness crisis.
Now it appears to be threatening the city’s budget.
On Thursday, Mr. de Blasio released a $95.3 billion budget proposal that called for a 2.7 percent increase — the smallest percentage increase in his six years in office.
