The couple met at the University of Michigan, from which each graduated.
Mrs. Sutton, 27, is pursuing a doctorate of nursing practice, family nurse practitioner at Columbia. Until July, she worked as a registered nurse in the dermatology unit at Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

The couple met in January 2014 at Scorekeepers, a popular off-campus bar in Ann Arbor, Mich., but began dating in August when they lived about five minutes from each other in New York — she in Murray Hill, he in Kips Bay.
