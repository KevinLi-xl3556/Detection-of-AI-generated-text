A Call to High School Letter Writers
Once again, we are holding a letter-writing competition for high school students. We invite you to submit a letter to the editor in response to a Times news article, editorial, column or Op-Ed in the last few days. We will publish a selection of our favorites.
Letters should be about 150 to 200 words and include the headline and a link to the article. Include your name, age, high school and grade, city or town and state (for publication), and telephone number (not for publication).
Email: letters@nytimes.com
Please put “Student Competition” in the subject line. The deadline is Sunday, Feb. 16.
For examples of what we’re looking for, look at the letters published here.
