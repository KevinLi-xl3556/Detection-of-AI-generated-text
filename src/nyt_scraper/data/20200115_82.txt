In Democratic Debate, the Candidates Mostly Kept the Gloves On
It’s unusual for a TV host to boast that the show we’re about to watch is the smallest ever. But that’s what CNN’s Wolf Blitzer did before Tuesday night’s Democratic debate, declaring that this was “the smallest debate stage yet this cycle.”
As the last forum before the first 2020 votes are cast, it felt like the end of a phase. The debates have functioned like a de facto national primary, conducted through the media and polls, which whittled a score of candidates on the stage in June down to six Tuesday night.
