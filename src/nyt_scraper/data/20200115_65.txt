Judge Orders Michael Avenatti to Be Held Without Bail
Michael Avenatti, who was arrested in California on accusations that he violated the terms of his bail, is to remain in federal custody and be transported to New York to stand trial in a separate case, a judge ordered Wednesday.
Mr. Avenatti was arrested Tuesday after prosecutors said that he defrauded and concealed money from creditors while on bail for similar charges from last year.
