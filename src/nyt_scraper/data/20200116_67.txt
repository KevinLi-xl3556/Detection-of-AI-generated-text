Searching for the Distinctive Character of California Syrah
Some wines confirm assumptions. Others shock the system.
Good syrah, especially when made using traditional methods like fermenting the grapes with their stems, can be one of those jarring wines. Depending on one’s experience and expectations, it can delight or appall.
I adore syrah, and the more extreme, the better. Yet when I recently opened a bottle of Louis Sozet Cornas 2014, a traditionally made syrah wine from the Northern Rhône Valley of France, for dinner, a friend did a double take.
