Bruce Springsteen’s Son Becomes a Jersey City Firefighter
If there’s a fire in Jersey City or a cat stuck in a tree, there’s a good chance that Bruce Springsteen’s son may be dispatched to the scene.
Sam Springsteen was one of 15 new firefighters who were sworn in Tuesday by Mayor Steven M. Fulop of Jersey City and the director of public safety, James Shea.
