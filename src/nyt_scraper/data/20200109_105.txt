‘The Woman Who Loves Giraffes’ Review: Crackers for Animals
In the summer of 1956, years before Jane Goodall encountered her chimpanzees, a young Canadian biologist named Anne Innis Dagg traveled, alone, to South Africa to meet her favorite beast in its natural habitat. As documented in “The Woman Who Loves Giraffes,” that trip — aside from a Scottish study of red deer — would make her the first scientist ever to study the behavior of animals in the wild. She was 23.
Blessed with a trove of 16-millimeter film footage captured during this yearlong adventure, the director, Alison Reid, uses it as the foundation for a far-ranging story of scientific discovery, sexual discrimination and environmental alarm. Guiding us is Dagg herself, now in her 80s and passionately involved in giraffe conservation and education. A warm, overwhelmingly modest woman who, for many years, remained ignorant of her published work’s impact on the zoological community, she recounts without bitterness a career destroyed and a life’s dream derailed by academic sexism.
Unable to continue studying her beloved giraffe, Dagg would spend years working to reform Canadian universities for the women who came after her. This gives the film a sorrowful tint and a rather stuffy middle section, dimming the vividness of the young Dagg’s ecstatic letters from South Africa to her mother and fiancé. Whether befriending African farm workers (and noting the indignities of apartheid) or peering excitedly at the heart and intestines of a dead giraffe, her unmitigated joy is the movie’s secret sauce. And when we see this remarkable woman, once overlooked and uncelebrated, return to the scene of her pioneering research, it’s clear she’s finally back where she belongs.
