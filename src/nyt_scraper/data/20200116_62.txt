Peacock, NBC’s Streaming Service, Will Have a Free Option and ‘The Office’
Despite taking its name from one of the flashiest animals on the planet, NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service is at risk of blending in with the flock.
On Thursday at Rockefeller Center, the media company, owned by the cable giant Comcast, made the case that Peacock would distinguish itself from Netflix and Disney Plus, among others in an increasingly crowded field, because it will rely on advertisements, rather than subscriptions, to generate revenue, while offering live broadcasts, including news programming and sports coverage, in addition to 15,000 hours of TV shows and movies.
