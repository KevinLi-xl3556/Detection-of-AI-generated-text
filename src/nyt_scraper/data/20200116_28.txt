5 Comedy Shows to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend
Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
‘BETTER JEOPARDY!!’ at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater Hell’s Kitchen (Jan. 17, 7:30 p.m.). The “Jeopardy! Greatest of All Time” tournament was mighty popular, but Noah Forman thinks the classic game show could still use some upgrades. Watch him put the improvisers Connor Ratliff and Kristen Acimovic, the Andy Kaufman Award winner Dru Johnston and the stand-up Alison Leiby through the trivia wringer as they grapple with even more rules and obstacles than merely forming their answers into questions.

‘THE BOB ROSS CHALLENGE LIVE!’ at Caveat (Jan. 18, 7 p.m.). In 2018, Micah Sherman and Mark Stetson started a series of YouTube videos in which they dared other funny people to emulate Ross, the host of the PBS series “The Joy of Painting” known for his preternaturally calm voice and his “happy little trees.” Their ultimate goal has been to raise money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (Ross, as well as Stetson’s father, died from lymphoma). Now they’re trying it in front of a live audience, with Janeane Garofalo, Josh Gondelman, Rebecca Vigil, Mia Jackson, Tarik Davis and a surprise guest attempting to copy the brush strokes in one of Ross’s classic painting tutorials.
