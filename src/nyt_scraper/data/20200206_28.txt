5 Classical Music Concerts to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
DANISH STRING QUARTET at Alice Tully Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 9, 5 p.m.; Feb. 11, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 18). “No quartet playing today has the Danish’s way with late Beethoven,” I wrote when naming this quartet’s most recent release as one of the best recordings of 2019. These concerts will more than likely bear that assessment out not just in terms of late Beethoven, but of his early work, too. Starting a complete survey of the Beethoven quartets that spans six concerts in the space of two weeks, these three young Danes and their Norwegian cellist play the first three Op. 18 quartets on Friday, the second three on Sunday and the “Razumovsky” quartets on Tuesday.

SIMONE DINNERSTEIN at Miller Theater (Feb. 13, 8 p.m.). In this second concert of a three-part all-Bach series that Dinnerstein has curated, she is at the piano for the Keyboard Concerto No. 1, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 and an arrangement of “Erbarm dich mein, o Herre Gott.” She performs all that with the Baroklyn ensemble, which also plays the Orchestral Suite No. 2.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at the Appel Room (Feb. 10, 7:30 p.m.) and David Geffen Hall (Feb. 13, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 18). The Philharmonic’s valuable Project 19, which has commissioned 19 women composers in celebration of the centenary of the 19th Amendment, gets fully into its stride with premieres of pieces by Nicole Lizée, Joan La Barbara and Paola Prestini appearing in a Sound ON concert on Monday, and Tania Léon’s “Stride” accompanying the Brahms Violin Concerto and the suite from Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier” in subscription concerts starting later in the coming week. Jaap van Zweden conducts those, with Janine Jansen as the soloist.

ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA at the 92nd Street Y (Feb. 9, 3 p.m.). Never mind Mendelssohn’s Octet, this concert deserves attention for its revival of the Nonet of Louise Farrenc, dating to 1849, a piece that shows the best of its remarkably fine composer, who taught at the Paris Conservatory and whose music is due for a revival. Also at the Y, Alexi Kenney performs a clever program of solo violin works by Bach and composers as diverse as Reich, Kurtag and Saariaho (Friday, 9 p.m.), and Sasha Cooke sings Schumann’s “Kerner Lieder” and “Frauenliebe und -leben” (Feb. 13, 7:30 p.m.).
212-415-5500, 92y.org
STILE ANTICO at Corpus Christi Church (Feb. 9, 4 p.m.). Appearing as part of the Music Before 1800 series, this extraordinarily thoughtful and accomplished British vocal ensemble sings music “by and for Renaissance women,” including compositions by Raffaella Aleotti, Leonora d’Este and Maddalena Casulana and works commissioned by female sovereigns such as Queen Mary I and Queen Elizabeth I from Tallis, Sheppard, Byrd and others.
