Why Kids Fight Getting Dressed
Every morning I sigh deeply before entering my girls’ room, knowing that I will spend the next five to 35 minutes negotiating what the kids will wear. It could take five minutes if my children simply put on what we laid out the night before. Or, 35 minutes if my 3-year-old insists on wearing the dress she wore yesterday; she has no concept of time and “yesterday”  could mean any moment in her living memory. Does she mean last week or last year? Does she still have this dress? Did it ever exist? Time is a flat circle.
Because this is nearly universal little-kid behavior, I wanted to know: Why is getting children dressed such a nightmare, and when will the nightmare end? Though there isn’t much research that focuses specifically on toddler-parent clothing conflicts, the answers, according to our experts, are 1) because clothing is one of the few ways small children have to express their autonomy and 2) never. It will never end.
