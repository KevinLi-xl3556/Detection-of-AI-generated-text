The Thatcher Hotel — an 18-room Victorian building in Hopland, Calif. — was, in the late 19th century, perhaps best known as the establishment where men brought their paramours. But these days, you’re more likely to find weekenders unloading their Subarus to check in for a night or two en route to the Mendocino Coast. Making the trip to Hopland is worth it alone to stay at the Thatcher, which recently emerged from an extensive renovation. Guest rooms range from studios with bunk beds to spacious suites with sitting rooms, and the décor is a pastiche of pioneer-inspired designs: Off the entrance, Urban Electric fixtures hang over the original oak bar; the library’s shelves, curated in part by the beloved Berkeley store Moe’s Books, are piled with volumes that relate to Northern California; the Bay Area furniture designer Alexis Moran outfitted the lobby with nooks for gathering over oat-milk lattes (in Heath Ceramics mugs). Come summertime, the backyard will be just as appealing with a new bocce court and three cabanas available by reservation. thatcherhotel.com.
