Since then, Iranians have vowed to retaliate, and Trump has promised more attacks if they do, claiming to have a list of 52 potential targets — one for each of the American hostages held by Iran during President Jimmy Carter’s administration. (He also said some of the targets would be cultural sites, which would violate international law.)
Stephen Colbert tried to sort it all out in his first “Late Show” monologue of 2020.
