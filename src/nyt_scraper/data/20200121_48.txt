Tiny Love Stories: ‘You Feel Good. Is This Good?’
We were in my college apartment after several weeks of hooking up when he said, “You feel good. Is this good?” “Yeah,” I said. “This is good. I feel good.” And he said, “I’m happy.” And I said, “I’m happy.” And he said, “I like this.” And I said, “I like you.” That was it — not in a “that was it, they fell in love” kind of way, but in a “that was it, he saw the possibility of connection beyond the confines of my bed and got scared and ran away” type of way. — Sarah Marlin
My husband, Hideki, was transferred to New Jersey from Tokyo. He left me and our 19-month-old toddler, Akari, to wrap things up. During our three-month separation, we video chatted. For Akari, her father existed in my computer. When Hideki returned to bring us to America, Akari saw him in our doorway and froze, hiding behind me and staring: first at my computer, then at him. Computer, him. Back and forth. Finally, she smiled and waddled to him for a hug. My anxiety about our new life melted away. — Ayumi Tagawa
Carolyn was born a year after me in the same month, April. Our mothers were sisters and our fathers were brothers, making us double cousins. As children in a Pennsylvania farming community, we often wore matching dresses, our hair in identical pixie cuts. After high school our paths diverged: me to college, eventually across the country; Carolyn to marriage at 19, two children, and a life devoted to church and family. When we met every few years, we hid our disappointment in each other’s choices. In middle age, dual breast cancer diagnoses brought us together again, no longer judging, rejoined. — Kathy Miller
My 93-year-old grandmother, who suffered from dementia, would call me by my brother’s name: “Azim! Azim!” Upset, I would tell her that Azim is not my name and to call me by my actual name. To which she would reply, “My dear, I am senile, remember?” — Aizat Alam
