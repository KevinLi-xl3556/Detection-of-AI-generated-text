‘Weathering With You’ Review: Letting the Sun Shine In
The rain doesn’t simply fall in “Weathering With You,” an anime about love in a time of catastrophe, it gushes. The record torrent that pounds Tokyo throughout is relentless: It floods streets and homes, wrapping the city in a heavy blanket of gray. There’s beauty here, though, in the shocks of color like the red latticework of an Eiffel-like tower and umbrellas that, when seen from above, look like promenading flowers.
Every so often, a ray of sunshine pierces the gloom, illuminating a small urban patch. The first time you see the sun streaming, it’s in the company of the teenage Hina (voiced by Nana Mori), who rushes toward the beam as if pulled by a magnet. She finds its terminus on the roof of a derelict building, where the light spreads over bright green, nodding blooms and an incongruously placed red torii gate. A traditional structure found in or at the entrance of Shinto shrines, the gate often serves as an entrance to a sacred space.
