Sleek and Subtle Chocolates
A notable characteristic of Goodnow Farms Chocolate bars is their sleek subtlety. New flavor combinations, like a dark chocolate spiced apple cider bar, are about nuance, not boldness. Each of the single-origin bars, with chocolate from farms in Central and South America, has its own character. The family-owned company, on a 225-year-old farm in Sudbury, Mass., is the outgrowth of a hobby. The bars are modest in size at 1.94 ounces.
