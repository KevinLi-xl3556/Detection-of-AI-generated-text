‘Party of Five’ and ‘Little America’: Immigrant Stories That Get the Job Done
In the opening minutes of Freeform’s “Party of Five,” Javier and Gloria Acosta (Bruno Bichir and Fernanda Urrejola) are arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the restaurant they own and operate. They’re terrified, but also they’re confused. No, they don’t have papers. But they’ve been in America for two decades. They have five children. Why seize them now, after all this time?
“Things have changed,” one of the agents says.
So they have. Two decades ago, we didn’t have a government promising to build a wall on the Mexican border, or an administration erecting barriers even to legal immigration and refugees, or rising deaths among detained migrants, or a president declaring, “Our Country is FULL.”
