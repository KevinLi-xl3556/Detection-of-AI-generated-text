The Year Ended With Another Big Sale at 220 Central Park South
The final month of 2019 ended almost the same way the year began: with an oversize sale at 220 Central Park South.
A sprawling duplex, Penthouse 73, sold for $92.7 million, and was New York City’s most expensive closing for the month of December, as well as the year’s second-biggest sale over all. The buyer, reportedly the hedge fund manager Daniel Och, also picked up a studio on the 19th floor for an additional $2.1 million.
While eye-popping in its own right, the penthouse sale still paled in comparison to the record-breaking, nearly $240 million purchase of four full floors by Kenneth Griffin, another hedge fund manager, in January 2019. (Mr. Griffin also acquired two adjacent studios on a lower floor in October.)
“Nothing may surpass it for a while,” Andrew Wachtfogel, the head of research for Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, said of the January sale, which was the most ever paid for a single residence in the nation. In the current market, he noted, “sales at 220 Central Park South are outliers.”
The limestone-clad tower — the most expensive condominium in 2019, with an average price per square foot of  $7,122, according to CityRealty — was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and is near Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan. Several other closings took place there in December, including a 48th-floor unit for $59 million, the month’s runner-up sale.
Among other notable transactions, a 65th-floor apartment at the supertall 432 Park Avenue, another of the city’s priciest buildings, changed owners for the fourth time since 2016.
John J. Legere sold his Central Park West duplex penthouse, just weeks after announcing he would be stepping down in April as the chief executive of T-Mobile; the buyer was the designer Giorgio Armani. Also, David A. Sackler, whose family owns Purdue Pharma, the makers of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, sold his Upper East Side apartment.
Penthouse 73 sits on 220 Central Park South’s 73rd and 74th floors. The 9,817-square-foot apartment has four bedrooms, five full baths and two half baths, along with a 796-square-foot terrace, according to the latest amended offering plan by the developer, Vornado Realty Trust. It had been listed for $100 million; monthly carrying charges total $40,110.
Besides being the building’s second most expensive unit, the apartment also is the third priciest residence ever sold in the city — behind Mr. Griffin’s purchase and a duplex at the pinnacle of One57, on West 57th Street, that was bought in 2015 for nearly $100.5 million, reportedly by Michael Dell, the chief executive of Dell Technologies.
The $59-million apartment on the 48th floor was sold to a New York entity called Noble Birch (US) Inc. The full-floor unit, which encompasses 6,591 square feet, has five bedrooms, six full baths, two powder rooms and a 96-square-foot balcony. The list price was $67 million.
Also closing in the building at year’s end was No. 66, another full-floor unit, with 4,935 square feet, four bedrooms, five full baths, two powder rooms and a 96-square-foot balcony. It was bought for $54.5 million by the limited liability company Datoun66.
No. 59A, a 3,814-square-foot unit with three bedrooms and three and a half baths, sold for $36.1 million, The buyers were listed as Liedong Ding and Haiyan Bao.
No. 34A was purchased for $31 million by the limited liability company SPC 34A.  It has 3,703 square feet with four bedrooms and four and a half baths, along with a 20-foot balcony. And No. 55B, which sold for $26.8 million, has 3,211 square feet, three bedrooms and three and a half baths. The buyer was 220 March LLC.
At 432 Park, the concrete-and-glass skyscraper between 56th and 57th Streets, apartment No. 65A closed at nearly $24 million. The 4,019-square-foot aerie has three bedrooms, four and a half baths and a library.
The sale price was below the $27 million that it first sold for in July 2016. (The unit was sold back to the building sponsor, in September 2017, for $27.9 million, and then sold again in December 2017, for $26.4 million.)
The most recent seller, identified as Mallow Enterprises LLC, with a Park Avenue address, lost $2.4 million on the deal. But the entity got a discount on another purchase: In September, it bought the Italian fashion designer Luca Orlandi’s townhouse at 18 East 73rd Street for $27 million, a steep reduction from the $40 million initial asking price.
Speaking of fashion designers (and reduced prices), Mr. Armani paid $17.5 million for Mr. Legere’s penthouse at the pinnacle of 91 Central Park West, a 15-story limestone-and-brick co-op building at 69th Street. The residence, Penthouse A, was originally owned by the publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. Mr. Legere bought it in 2015 for $18 million, then returned it to the market in 2018 for $22 million.    
Mr. Armani, who already owns a neighboring penthouse, will now be able to expand his footprint, and maybe add a few pieces from his Armani/Casa line of luxury home furnishings. He reportedly tried to buy Penthouse A in 2014, but the deal fell through.
His new 3,600-square-foot duplex has four bedrooms and four baths, in addition to striking park and cityscape vistas from its two terraces and oversize windows. The home also has retained much of its prewar grandeur and scale, including the hand-carved mahogany and oak doors and oak burnsall paneling in the living room.
Mr. Sackler got nearly $6.1 million for his 16th-floor apartment at 200 East 66th Street, a.k.a. Manhattan House, between Second and Third Avenues. The buyer was a limited liability company called Fiascari.
The 3,343-square-foot unit has four bedrooms and five baths, along with a den that could be converted into another bedroom and a full-size laundry room. It also comes with separate storage space.
Mr. Sackler is a grandson of Raymond Sackler, who with his two brothers transformed a tiny Greenwich Village company into the pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma.
