Campy Horror in Living Color
Newly restored, Roger Corman’s riotously colorful adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Masque of the Red Death” (1964) and Michael Curtiz’s shimmering pink-and-green “Mystery of the Wax Museum” (1933) are as gaudy as the day they opened — if not as scary.
The two vintage horror films are showing as a de facto double bill on Friday and Monday as part of the Museum of Modern Art’s annual festival of preservation, To Save and Project.
