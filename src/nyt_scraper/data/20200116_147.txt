The Obama Bounce Has Real Impact — and It Has Nothing to Do With Basketball
THE AUDACITY OF NOPE On Dec. 28, 2019, Jenny Odell was at home in Oakland, Calif., getting ready to meet friends at the movie “1917,” when her boyfriend suddenly called out to her from the next room. “He said, ‘I have some weird and good news for you,’” she remembers. He had just clicked on a tweet from former President Obama, announcing his list of favorite books from 2019. Listed at No. 6 (titles were in alphabetical order) was Odell’s first book, “How to Do Nothing,” which our reviewer described as “a complex, smart and ambitious book that first reads like a self-help manual, then blossoms into a wide-ranging political manifesto.” The gist: Stop toggling. Pay attention. Notice nature.
For Odell, a multidisciplinary artist and an avid bird-watcher, news of Obama’s enthusiasm was “totally out of the blue.” She says, “I’m honestly surprised that anyone had the patience to wade through what is at times a dense, strangely shaped book.” She continued on with her day: She went to the movie. She checked on some ducks that were using a nearby lake as a way station on their journey south. (In her book, Odell writes, “Simple awareness is the seed of responsibility”; she is an author who practices what she preaches.)
