As an American expatriate in Paris, Catherine Down worked hard to find community. Most of that work involved food. Connecting with local cheesemongers, wine sellers and chocolatiers, Ms. Down found both sustenance and friendship.
On this week’s Modern Love podcast, the actress and comedian Jenny Slate reads Ms. Down’s funny and surprisingly poignant essay, “Need to Find Me? Ask My Ham Man.”
Ms. Down is a freelance food, humor and travel writer. Ms. Slate recently released a stand-up comedy special, “Stage Fright,” on Netflix. She is also the author of “Little Weirds.” Stay tuned after the reading to hear more from her, the Modern Love editor Daniel Jones, Ms. Down and Ms. Down’s ham man, Solofo Raveloson.
