Film Club: ‘Climbing the Shark’s Fin’
“Climbing the Shark’s Fin" is a seven-minute film that explores what it means to push oneself to the edge of one’s limit. It chronicles three mountain climbers as they attempt one of the most elusive first ascents in the Indian Himalayas, the precarious Shark’s Fin route on Mount Meru. With astonishing camera work, we follow as these climbers strive to reach their goal despite the possible risk of losing fingers, toes — and maybe even their lives.
Why do some people thrive on extreme physical challenges? What can we learn from their journeys?
