Variety: Acrostic
ACROSTIC — Did anyone else have a visceral response to the passage today and smell burned hair? I love it when words activate another sense. The author, Deborah Blum, is an expert in poisons, their history and their effects on the body; the passage is autobiographical and relates to her relevant interests earlier in life. Ms. Blum is a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on primate research, and has also written books about sex and affection. It makes sense that she's honed her skills at recording hard-to-express experiences, but I’m still impressed and amazed at how clearly she set the scene in this passage, in just a handful of words.
That brings me to Team Cox/Rathvon’s cluing, which is a lot of fun. This acrostic didn’t build steadily for me; it solved in fits and starts. I knew NINEBARK, BIG SHOT and BOHEMIA but didn’t get much traction from those three and had to take some chances with RHYMING and IRON AGE. I had LUCKY “die” instead of HIT for a long time and was mystified by the two anagrammed clues at V. and W.; finally enough letters popped up in each clue to get me ORANGES and ONAGERS. ONAGERS crop up more in puzzles than they ever do in life, I think. They’re nomadic donkeys of the desert, and apparently they are always accompanied by an accomplished pianist on their travels.
I had never heard of a NARGHILE before, and its clue was tricky — this is a synonym for hookah, pretty much, which doesn’t come to mind when I think “water pipe.” I read “Hamatreya” many years ago, but didn’t remember the line from EMERSON (that poem is a doozy, though). I consider today’s cluing pretty crunchy in general, but worth it for a nice passage.
