$400,000 Homes in Indiana, Massachusetts and Arkansas

This was the second project conceived by Avriel Shull, a local architectural designer, on a parcel of family farmland that was a gift from her father. The entire 11 acres, which she platted and designed, ultimately comprised three streets and held 28 houses, 21 built under her direction. Called Christie’s Thornhurst, the neighborhood was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. It is a block north of Main Street and 15 minutes on foot northwest of Carmel’s Arts and Design District, a lively business area. Route 31, one mile west, leads directly to Indianapolis, whose center is about 15 miles south.
