‘Intrigo: Death of an Author’ Review: Many Mysteries, Fewer Thrills
In 1945 the literary critic Edmund Wilson, riffing on an Agatha Christie title, asked “Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?” His attack on what he called “detective stories” did nothing to deter the popularity of mysteries in print or onscreen. But his title point is salient. Unless a detective puzzle is so diabolically constructed that it sustains fascination in the absence of credible human interest (as in Ellery Queen), some emotional investment is desirable.
