Mark Hamill, a ‘Star Wars’ Star, Gets His Record Back
Mark Hamill, known to millions as Luke Skywalker, said he was shocked last month when he saw a post on Twitter. An Arizona bookstore said it had found his original “Star Wars” soundtrack, whose sleeve had been inscribed and given to him by the composer John Williams, and wanted to return it to the actor.
“I wasn’t completely sure that it was mine,” Mr. Hamill said in an interview on Monday. “But I know that I’d had an album signed by John. How would they know that?”
