Democrats Say JPMorgan’s Response to Racism Questions Was Lacking
JPMorgan Chase disclosed this week that less than 5 percent of its nearly 3,700 financial advisers are black and said it still had work to do to improve diversity in its ranks. But some Democratic lawmakers want to know more.
Congressional Democrats in both chambers were critical of the bank on Thursday for its response to questions they raised in response to a New York Times report about racism at some of the bank’s branches in Arizona.
