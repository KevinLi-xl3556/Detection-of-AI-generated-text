Justice, Weaponized

The House impeached President Trump for inappropriately using the powers of the United States government for his own political benefit.
Last week, on the cusp of the Senate trial, The Times’s Adam Goldman broke the news of another way that Trump may be abusing his power: The Justice Department is investigating years-old leaks to journalists, apparently focused on James Comey, the former F.B.I. director and harsh critic of Trump.
“We keep seeing examples of the Department of Justice weaponized against Trump’s political antagonists,” Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica wrote, in response to the news. “It’s among the most dangerous and lasting aspects of his presidency.”
In so many ways — the weaponizing of investigations, the pressure on Ukraine, the profiting off the presidency and more — Trump isn’t just rejecting basic democratic values; he’s doing so flagrantly. If he wins re-election, the American people (or at least the voting public, as measured by the Electoral College) will have validated his behavior.
Given these stakes, Lara Bazelon, a writer and former trial lawyer, had some excellent advice for House Democrats in The Washington Post. “Never forget who your audience is,” Bazelon wrote. In most trials, the audience is the jury. In this case, however, the members of the jury — both Democratic and Republican senators — have almost all already made up their minds. So the real audience is “the American public — specifically, the small but crucial number of people who live in swing states and have yet to make up their minds.”
If Democrats keep the trial focused on that audience, they can increase the chances that “they will achieve a public nullification of the Senate’s foregone verdict, in the form of Trump’s defeat in the November elections,” Bazelon explained.
