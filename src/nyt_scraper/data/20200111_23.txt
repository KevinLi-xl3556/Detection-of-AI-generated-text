Training Geriatricians
To the Editor:
The need for geriatricians and geriatrics training (Science Times, Jan. 7) is becoming increasingly urgent. Yet most medical schools still lack a required geriatrics rotation, despite national guidelines calling for more rigorous training of future physicians.
To address this gap, at Harvard Medical School, we have launched an “Aging and End of Life” curricular theme that integrates these important aspects of caring for older adults throughout the medical school experience.
The updated curriculum includes a home visit to an elder individual living in the community, and mock clinical exams in which the patient-actor ages between visits.
Ongoing federal and philanthropic support of such efforts is critical to ensure that doctors-in-training graduate prepared to deliver the evidence-based, compassionate and individualized care that older patients deserve.
