The Groundbreaking Artist Who’s Not Slowing Down at 93
This film is part of a special Op-Docs series of short documentaries premiering in the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.
At 93, there’s no stopping when it comes to the legendary artist Betye Saar. A self-proclaimed “recycler,” Ms. Saar has been creating assemblage art for decades. The objects in her work reflect her very personal visions of nature, spirituality and ideas addressing equality and a new kind of African-American representation. By taking a derogatory caricature like Aunt Jemima and outfitting her with weapons, Ms. Saar transforms her into an image of power and certitude. Learn more about her story, in her own words, in the short documentary above.
