A New Outpost for Green Tea
Kettl, a Japanese green tea specialist that imports directly from farms in Japan, has been tucked away in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, since 2016. Now, the owners, Zach Mangan and his wife, Minami Mangan, have opened a Manhattan branch with a some new features, notably precisely brewed teas to stay or to go, which they do not offer at the Brooklyn shop. In NoHo, theyâ€™re serving tea-based ice cream made for Kettl by Il Laboratorio del Gelato. Tea utensils, some fashioned by Ms. Mangan, a potter, are available, though the selection is smaller than what they sell in Brooklyn and online. Mr. Mangan, a tea lover, started working for the Ito-En company in New York, then went to Japan and eventually started his own business.
