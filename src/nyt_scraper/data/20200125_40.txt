The White House legal team will begin presenting its case.
President Trump’s legal team plans to mount an aggressive defense that looks more like offense on Saturday as it opens its side in the Senate impeachment trial by attacking his accusers as partisan witch-hunters trying to remove him because they cannot beat him at the ballot box.
As the trial moves into a new phase after three days of arguments by the House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, the president’s lawyers will present the senators a radically different view of the facts and the Constitution, while seeking to undercut the whole process by painting it as illegitimate and unfounded.
“We have two goals,” Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s lead lawyers, told reporters in advance of the session. “We’re going to refute the allegations they’ve made, and we’re going to put on an affirmative case as well.”
