Zoe Lofgren: Impeachment Manager Is a Veteran of Two Impeachment Inquiries
WASHINGTON â€” When it comes to impeachment, Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, is arguably the institutional memory for Congress.
She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 when it approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with a White House intern. And as a young law student in 1974, she helped the committee draft its Watergate charges against President Richard M. Nixon.
