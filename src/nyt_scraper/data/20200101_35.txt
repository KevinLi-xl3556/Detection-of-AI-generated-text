‘A Quiet Place Part II’ First Trailer: Why Is It So Noisy?
As the first trailer for “A Quiet Place Part II” opens, the world has apparently returned to relative normalcy.  Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) even drives down a small-town street with her three children in tow. The peace lasts for only a few seconds, and then the deadly extraterrestrial creatures who terrorized her family in the original horror movie, a sleeper hit in 2018,  reappear to create havoc.
The sightless monsters, who attack and kill anything that causes sound, force the Abbott family out of their farmhouse and on the run. But after Evelyn trips a wire that triggers a noisy trap, she discovers a group of mysterious renegades (including characters played by new cast members Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou) hiding out. They warn her that the enemies aren’t just aliens. As Murphy’s character puts it, “The people who are left are not the kind of people worth saving.”
Once again directed by Blunt’s real-life husband, John Krasinksi (who co-starred in the  first installment), “A Quiet Place Part II” will be unleashed in theaters on March 20.
