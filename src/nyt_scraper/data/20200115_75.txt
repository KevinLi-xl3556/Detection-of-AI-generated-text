Val Demings: Impeachment Manager Offers Law Enforcement Experience
WASHINGTON — As one of the newer members of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida, was one of the last to question Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, during the seven-hour hearing in July on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
But it was a question from Ms. Demings about President Trump’s written answers to the inquiry that elicited a rare and striking concession outside the contents of Mr. Mueller’s report. When she asked whether the president’s “answers showed that he wasn’t always being truthful,” Mr. Mueller appeared to agree: “I would say generally.”
