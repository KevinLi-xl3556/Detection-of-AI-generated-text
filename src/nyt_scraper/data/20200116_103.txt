Martin Lawrence on Explosions On and Offscreen
Martin Lawrence is not running quite like he used to, but he’s feeling just fine.
The comedian and actor pulled a muscle shooting a footrace with Will Smith in their new movie, “Bad Boys for Life,” the third in a hit buddy-cop franchise that was birthed 25 years ago. This installment, not surprisingly, has a number of jokes about its leads getting older. (The “ride together, die together” tagline could be changed to “dye together,” now that Smith’s character needs to touch up the gray in his goatee.) And yet it still has the high-octane action that defines these movies.
Lawrence’s character, Marcus Burnett, much like Lawrence now, is a little reflective. They’ve both had long careers with ups and downs, and are thinking about their pasts as well as their futures.
