Who Won the Debate? Experts Weigh In
Twitter can’t tell us whether, or how, Tuesday’s CNN/Des Moines Register debate might change voters’ minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and analysts.
Here is a sampling of their reactions.
There was no real disagreement about the most effective moment of the night: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s response to the inevitable question about her dispute with Senator Bernie Sanders. After saying she was “not here to try to fight with Bernie,” Ms. Warren pivoted to the much larger question of women’s “electability.”
The consensus among the strategists and analysts was that Ms. Warren won the electability exchange with Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Sanders got good reviews for his overall debate performance.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has performed well in almost every debate, and this one was no exception. Commentators singled out her responses on Iran and health care as particularly strong.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has a reputation for shaky debate performances, but strategists thought that he held his own on Tuesday, especially on foreign policy.
