Kevin Love, Amid Trade Talk, Is Finding a Way to Fit In
LOS ANGELES — Kevin Love was still relatively new to the Cleveland Cavaliers in February 2015, and still struggling to find his niche within the team’s offense, when LeBron James, his most high-profile teammate, logged on to Twitter to deliver a message.
“Stop trying to find a way to FIT-OUT,” James wrote, “and just FIT-IN.”
At the time, James told reporters that he was not directing the message toward anyone in particular. But he seemed to be targeting Love, who had expressed frustration with his limited role after spending several seasons as the unquestioned alpha with the Minnesota Timberwolves.
