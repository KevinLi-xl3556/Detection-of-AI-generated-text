Exploring the Solar System Anew at the Hayden Planetarium
“Worlds Beyond Earth” is the first new space show at the American Museum of Natural History in more than six years, and if you haven’t been to a planetarium in a while, the experience is a bit like being thrown out of your own orbit.
Surrounded by brilliant colors, the viewer glides through space in all directions, unbound by conventional rules of orientation or vantage point. Dizzying spirals show the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At one point, museumgoers are taken along a journey from the perspective of a comet.
