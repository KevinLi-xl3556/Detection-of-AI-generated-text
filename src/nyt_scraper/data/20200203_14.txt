Grab and Go Mango Lassi
This simplest of smoothies, fairly thick, deliciously tart-sweet and fragrant, makes no claims of enhancing your immune system, ridding your face of wrinkles or saving your marriage. Made with high-quality Alphonso mangoes and Ronnybrook Farm yogurt, this new mango lassi is made by Monsieur Singh — a company founded by Karan Gera, an entrepreneur — with Ronnybrook. Previously, Mr. Gera produced and sold frozen lassi in pints. The new drink is satisfying enough to tide you over when breakfast or lunch are given short shrift. You could sip it alongside a meal, or pour some like an affogato over mango sorbet for dessert. The eight-ounce serving has 160 calories.
