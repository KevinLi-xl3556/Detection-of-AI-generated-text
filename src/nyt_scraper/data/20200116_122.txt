After ‘Please Like Me,’ Josh Thomas’s New Show Is All Fiction
The Australian TV dramedy “Please Like Me” earned a devoted following and an international Emmy nomination for the way it used droll humor to explore difficult, even tragic, events. Its creator and star, the comedian Josh Thomas, drew from his own life to shape the four-season show, including his experiences coming out as gay and dealing with his mother’s attempted suicide.
Thomas, 32, is now back with a new show, “Everything’s Gonna Be Okay,” which he also wrote and stars in. (The show will premiere on Jan. 16 on Freeform, and episodes will be on Hulu from Jan. 17.)
