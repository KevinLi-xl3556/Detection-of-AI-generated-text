Martin Luther King Jr. Day: 8 Places in New York to Remember His Legacy
King delivered a sermon titled “The Death of Evil Upon the Seashore” in 1956 at this enormous Episcopalian house of worship in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. In his speech, he drew a connection between the escape of Jewish slaves from Egypt in the Book of Exodus and the fate of African-Americans fighting for equality. “There is a Red Sea in history that ultimately comes to carry the forces of goodness to victory,” he said. To commemorate King’s courageous optimism, the cathedral will hold a service in his memory. Later in the afternoon, in the Chapel of St. James, the composer and conductor Alice Parker will lead an hour of communal singing to honor the civil rights leader. Both events are free and open to the public.
