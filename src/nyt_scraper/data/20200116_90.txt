Liz Cheney Says She Won’t Run for Senate in Wyoming
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, said Thursday that she would not seek the Senate seat being vacated by Michael B. Enzi, choosing instead to focus on her re-election campaign.
The announcement, which was first reported by The Casper Star Tribune, ended speculation that Ms. Cheney — the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney — would give up her place in House leadership to join a competitive primary for the Senate seat. She had run for the seat in 2014 but withdrew from the race.
