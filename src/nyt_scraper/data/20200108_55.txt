A Brief History of John Baldessari
John Baldessari, the conceptual artist whose work helped put the Los Angeles art scene on the map, died on Thursday, at the age of 88. The video above was commissioned by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2011, when it honored Mr. Baldessari and Clint Eastwood at its Art + Film gala, and later published on YouTube.
Museum officials were worried that Mr. Eastwood’s highlight reel would overshadow Mr. Baldessari’s (what with all the cowboy-movie shootouts, etc.) and that the drunken Hollywood types attending wouldn’t pay attention since artist documentaries are usually so boring. We challenged ourselves to make a film that reflected the spirit of Mr. Baldessari’s work. No more boring art!
Mr. Baldessari was game, and so was Tom Waits.
