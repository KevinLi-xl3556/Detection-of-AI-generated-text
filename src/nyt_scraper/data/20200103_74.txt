Who Ordered Impeachment Light?

Nancy Pelosi’s decision to delay sending the impeachment articles to the Senate has had some benefits. The New York Daily News editorial board lists three:
I’ll add a fourth benefit, quoting from my colleague Gail Collins: The delay draws attention “to the fact that the jury is fixed.” Pelosi’s stated reason for the delay is a desire to see the Senate agree to fair trial rules, including the calling of witnesses.
In the slow-news period of the last two weeks, Pelosi’s gambit has worked fairly well. It may still have a few more weeks to run.
Ultimately, though, I don’t see how a refusal to send the articles will be good for Democrats.
Why? Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, is as skilled at holding together his caucus as Pelosi is at holding together hers. He is unlikely to lose the four Republicans who would need to vote against him to allow Democrats to help set the trial rules.
And I think a long standoff — in which Pelosi threatens never to send the articles — would create new problems for Democrats. It would suggest they didn’t have the courage of their convictions when impeaching Trump. They instead would have chosen a strange half measure, Impeachment Light.
For now, Pelosi’s move has worked better than I expected. But the endgame still seems the same. We will start to learn more today, as the Senate reconvenes for the new year.
