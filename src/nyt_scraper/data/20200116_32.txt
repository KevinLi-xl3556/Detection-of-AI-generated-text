BLACK WOMEN: TRAILBLAZING AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTRESSES AND IMAGES, 1920-2001 at Film Forum (Jan. 17-Feb. 13). In an extraordinarily wide-ranging series, Film Forum examines the portrayal of African-American women throughout film history and celebrates the legacies of the actresses who played them. They range from Evelyn Preer (“Within Our Gates,” on Jan. 28) and Iris Hall (“The Symbol of the Unconquered,” on Jan. 30), who starred in silent films by the pioneering black director Oscar Micheaux, to the blaxploitation icon Pam Grier (“Coffy,” on Saturday, and “Foxy Brown,” on Feb. 1, among others) and beyond. The program’s nominal endpoint, 2001, was the year that “Monster’s Ball” (on Feb. 11 and 13) came out. Its star, Halle Berry, won the best actress Oscar for her role, becoming the first and so far only black woman to receive that honor.
