Trump Impeachment: What to Expect From the House and Senate Today
After a monthlong delay, the House is expected to vote on Wednesday to send two articles of impeachment to the Senate, setting in motion only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.
The day will be filled with pomp and circumstance, including a vote on the House floor, a formal “engrossment” ceremony of the impeachment articles and a procession through the Capitol Rotunda to formally deliver the charges to the Senate.
