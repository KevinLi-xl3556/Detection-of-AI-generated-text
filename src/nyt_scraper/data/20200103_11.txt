How Have Australia’s Wildfires Affected You?
As wildfires continue to devastate southeast Australia, thousands of residents and tourists have evacuated. The fires, fed by strong winds and triple-digit temperatures, have killed at least 18 people and destroyed more than 1,000 homes and millions of acres of land.
The states of Victoria and New South Wales, where Sydney is, have declared emergencies, and conditions are expected to worsen over the weekend.
We would like to hear from people who have been affected by the wildfires, if they are safe and able to respond. Please send us your photos or videos of your surroundings, and tell us how you’ve coped. We may publish a selection of the submissions in an upcoming article.
