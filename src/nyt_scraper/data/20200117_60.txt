The Opening Moves in the Trump Impeachment Trial
To the Editor:
Re “Trump’s Trial Opens as New Evidence Emerges” (front page, Jan. 17):
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts opened the impeachment trial of President Trump by swearing the Senate to “impartial justice.” Why bother? By their own admission, the Republicans will not keep their oath. From the start, the trial is a sham.
If the current age has taught us anything, it is that personal interest, naked political ambition or tribal affiliation trumps everything else. Since the Republicans have committed to executing “partial justice,” we have little choice but to teach our children to mistrust our highest elected officials. Perhaps mutual respect and community connection can exist on more local levels where we have to look one another in the eye. But not at the federal level. That connection has been broken.

Re “Ukraine Reviews Claim That Allies of President Were Spying on Envoy” (news article, Jan. 17):
At long last, President Trump has gotten what he has been wishing for. The Ukrainian government is investigating corruption just as Mr. Trump requested. Not only are the Ukrainians investigating allies of Mr. Trump for spying on an American ambassador, but they are also asking the F.B.I. to help them investigate possible Russian attacks against the computer systems of Burisma, the Ukrainian company whose board Hunter Biden served on.
Congratulations, Mr. Trump, you have finally succeeded in getting the Ukrainian government to fight corruption. Perhaps now you can grant President Volodymyr Zelensky the White House visit he has longed for.
