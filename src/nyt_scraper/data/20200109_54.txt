Another Comics Surprise From Robert Kirkman
Robert Kirkman likes to shake up fan expectations and he is doing it again: by releasing a graphic novel related to his new martial-arts-inspired series, Fire Power (co-created by the artist Chris Samnee).
Fire Power: Prelude will arrive in stores on April 29, a few days before the first issue of the comic. The novel sets up the story of Owen Johnson, who is out to learn about his birth parents, and whose story continues with the comic book.
Kirkman enjoys surprising comic book retailers and fans. in 2018, he sent comic book stores free copies of his Die!Die!Die! Comic, which was written with Scott M. Gimple. Last year, he gave fans of The Walking Dead comic book a double shock. Issue No. 192, in June, chronicled the death of Rick Grimes, the central character since the series premiere in 2003. But the bigger surprise came the next month, when that issue was also the series finale.
The Fire Power comic book will be given away on May 2, on Free Comic Book Day. Fans who miss out on a free copy will have a chance to buy Issue No. 1 when Issue No. 2 is released later in May.
Fire Power is published by Skybound, an imprint of Image Comics.
