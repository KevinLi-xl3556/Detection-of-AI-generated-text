Boys Could Have ‘Fun With You,’ Michigan Legislator Tells Reporter
A Michigan state legislator told a reporter that she should “hang around” with teenage boys visiting the state’s Senate chamber because they could “have a lot of fun with you,” the reporter said Wednesday.
The remarks by State Senator Peter J. Lucido, a Republican, have prompted leaders from both parties to ask the Senate Business Office to investigate whether the comment amounted to sexual harassment.
