Homeless Mothers Are Removed From an Oakland House
Good morning.

My colleague Conor Dougherty, who lives in Oakland, has been keeping tabs on a protest there aimed at drawing attention to the housing crisis. Here’s his dispatch:
A week before Thanksgiving, Dominique Walker, her two children and two other families moved into a vacant three-bedroom house at 2928 Magnolia Street in West Oakland. They washed the walls, installed a water heater, hauled their kids’ bunk beds upstairs and appointed the living room with a mix of plants and soft furniture. They paid the water and electric bills.
They did all this knowing they weren’t supposed to be there, but that was the point. The house is owned by Wedgewood, a Redondo Beach company that buys and renovates homes, then flips them for resale. The surrounding neighborhood has all the markings of gentrification, like raw lumber fencing, a freshly painted house with a blue gray hue and a sidewalk for-sale sign that read “OwnWestOakland.com.”
