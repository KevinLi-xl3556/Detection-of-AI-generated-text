Shopping for Bathmats
It’s the first thing you step on when you get out of the shower or bathtub, and the only thing standing between you and a cold floor (or a wet one) — a small, but essential luxury.
But a bathmat can be more than that.
When you’re decorating a bathroom, think of the bathmat as “a little art piece,” said Clodagh, a New York-based interior designer. “Keep the towels simple, but have a little fun on the floor.”
That’s what she did at the Six Senses Kaplankaya resort in Turkey, for instance: In bathrooms that were otherwise minimalist, she installed striped, flat-weave cotton mats, for a little kick of character.
Just make sure to think about where the bathmat will hang when it’s not in use.
“It’s not good over the top of the shower,” Clodagh said. “But on the side of the tub or the rail of a shower door, it looks decorative and nice.”
The choice of bathmat may seem insignificant, she noted, but every accessory in a bathroom is worthy of consideration: “Bathrooms are small places, so you can’t afford to make a mistake.”
