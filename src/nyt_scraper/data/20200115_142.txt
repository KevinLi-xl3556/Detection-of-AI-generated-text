Man Accused of Making ‘Swatting’ Threats With White Supremacists
A former Virginia college student has been charged with falsely reporting bomb threats and active shootings as part of what the authorities called an effort by a nationwide ring of white supremacists to incite panic and draw a heightened law enforcement response.
The targets of the spreading of false reports — a practice known as swatting — included a historic black church in Alexandria, Va.; campus buildings at Old Dominion University; and an address for a person under Secret Service protection, an F.B.I. agent said in an affidavit filed last Wednesday in federal court in Virginia.
