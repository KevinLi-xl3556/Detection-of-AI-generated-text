Poem: Dark Period
Plays on words and tiny twists mean much in a poem. In “Lean Against This Late Hour,” his mesmerizing seventh collection of poems, Garous Abdolmalekian makes us wonder: What if we could put a period on an entire period? Turn a corner, change the tune? And who is that little disappearing girl we barely see — what world is she being given? Something calms in the simple repetition of a word or thought and the hopeful conviction of “there will be.”
By Garous Abdolmalekian
In this line
or the next one
there will be a period,
an end to all the words.

Within the stark frame of the window,
tired silhouettes
and the dark dress
of a little girl growing distant
                                       growing distant
                                                    growing distant

In the stark frame of the window
a dark period
grows distant.

A period
that is the end to all the words.
