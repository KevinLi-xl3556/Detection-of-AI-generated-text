From a Rape Survivor: #MeToo Gives Me Hope
To the Editor:
Re “She Is Putting #MeToo on Trial” (front page, Jan. 15):
There’s a never-ending litany for why rape survivors shouldn’t be trusted. Were they drunk? Or flirty? Wearing matching undergarments?
I was. And I knew that few would believe me.
When you’ve been raped, you find that the judicial process is stacked against you. Anything we said or did could be used against us. Even with eyewitnesses and DNA evidence, assault survivors rarely find justice.
The comments by Harvey Weinstein’s lawyer, Donna Rotunno, that #MeToo has gone too far reminded me why I never reported being raped. It’s often seen as more important to protect a man’s reputation than to acknowledge the woman’s suffering. No amount of proof is enough, and history shows that few rape cases will be prosecuted. Most attackers will walk free.
Ms. Rotunno suggests that #BelieveAllWomen is about trusting all accusations with impunity. It’s not. Rather, it’s the first step in bestowing credibility upon survivors who have constantly been denied legitimacy. It’s the first time we’ve had a smidgen of hope, and it’s largely due to the women who spoke out against a cycle of abuse by her client, Mr. Weinstein.
#MeToo has finally given survivors a platform, but it has only just begun to shake at a deeply rooted system.
