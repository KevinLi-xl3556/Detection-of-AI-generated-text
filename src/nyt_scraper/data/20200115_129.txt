Three Movie Stars Head for Dubai but End Up in the Uncanny Valley
A title card reads ‘‘Dubai Presents,’’ as if the city were a movie studio. We hear Kate Hudson’s voice: ‘‘I think we should all go out!’’ She appears on a boat with Gwyneth Paltrow under a cloudy sky. It’s an absurd thing to say, and it cracks them both up. Because of course they’re going out later. What else would they do? Stay in? They’re in Dubai!
It looks to be early in the morning, and the two A-listers (and real-life friends) are acting pretty batty. Did they get enough sleep? Are they still drunk? Something about it feels off, and then the next thing you know, Paltrow is standing up in the boat, arms raised above her head in a victorious V, bellowing, ‘‘Ahhhhhh!’’ at the top of her lungs.
