California Confirms Coronavirus Patient, Marking Third U.S. Case
The United States has confirmed a third case of the novel coronavirus, after a traveler from China tested positive for the disease in Orange County, Calif.
The Orange County Health Care Agency, which received confirmation of the case in California from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement on Saturday that the person had been sent to the hospital and was in “good condition.”
The patient is a traveler from Wuhan, China, and “there is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred in Orange County,” according to the agency. “The current risk of local transmission remains low,” the statement said.
As China struggles to contain the outbreak of the deadly pneumonialike virus, global authorities are grappling with a rising number of cases at their borders. Canada and Portugal both announced suspected cases this weekend.
In China, 1,975 people have been infected with the coronavirus since the outbreak began last year in Wuhan. The death toll in China has risen to 56.
World authorities are taking their own precautions to keep the virus from spreading. Taiwan said on Sunday that it would bar all visitors from China’s Hubei Province to the self-governing island, where a few cases have been confirmed.
The United States has limited passengers who have recently visited Wuhan to a handful of airports that have special screening processes in place. A number of people around the United States are being monitored for potential cases of the respiratory illness.
The person in California brings to three the number of confirmed case in the United States. The others are a woman in her 60s in Chicago and a man in his 30s in Washington State.
