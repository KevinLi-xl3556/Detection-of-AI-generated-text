The Work Diary of Derrius Quarles, Million-Dollar Multitasker
Derrius Quarles is a man of many modes, but he’s perhaps best known for founding Breaux Capital, an online financial platform and community for black millennial men (the name is a play on the word “bro”). Having read that 70 percent of black millennials couldn’t afford a $1000 emergency, he created an app that automates savings and co-invests the money with two friends: Ras Asan, whom he met on a summer study abroad trip to Ghana, and Brian L. Williams, a fellow graduate of Morehouse College. “We work with anything from traditional ETFs” — exchange-traded funds — “to the cannabis industry,” Mr. Quarles, 29, said.
Members can choose to become co-owners and have equity in the company, and 80 percent do, Mr. Quarles said. “It’s very different from the relationship folks might have with their bank. If I bank with Wells Fargo, it’s not like I can walk into a branch and say ‘I don’t like how this operates,’” he said, adding: “If you are a co-owner in Breaux Capital it means you decide how the company works. You are a decision maker.”
