American Family Stuck in Saudi Arabia While Father Stands Trial
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Five months after Saudi Arabia released a doctor with dual Saudi-American citizenship from jail, he and seven family members remain barred from leaving the kingdom while he stands trial on charges the United States contends are meritless, a son and a senior State Department official said.
The Saudi authorities detained the doctor, Walid Fitaihi, during what they called an anti-corruption campaign in late 2017 and released him pending trial last summer. He has told confidantes that Saudi jailers tortured him. The authorities have confiscated his family’s passports, leaving eight dual Saudi-American citizens stuck in the kingdom, the son and the official said.
