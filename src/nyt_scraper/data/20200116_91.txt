Philadelphia Mayor: Museum Should ‘Strengthen’ Sexual Harassment Policy
Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia called for the Philadelphia Museum of Art to “strengthen” its sexual harassment policies in response to allegations of misconduct against one of the museum’s former managers.
In his comments, made to The Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday, Mr. Kenney — who holds an ex officio position on the museum’s board — said the institution should “review and strengthen its policies regarding anti-fraternization and sexual harassment, and require training for all staff.” The museum’s building is owned by the City of Philadelphia.
