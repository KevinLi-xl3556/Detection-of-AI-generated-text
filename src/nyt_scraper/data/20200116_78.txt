George Nicolau, Arbitrator in Baseball’s Collusion Cases, Dies at 94
George Nicolau, a prominent arbitrator who determined that Major League Baseball teams colluded in the 1980s to restrict bidding for free agents, leading club owners to pay players $280 million in damages, died on Jan. 2 in Manhattan. He was 94.
His stepson John Oppenheimer said the cause was kidney failure.
Mr. Nicolau was named baseball’s independent arbitrator in 1986, replacing Thomas T. Roberts, whom owners had fired as he was hearing the first collusion case between them and the Major League Baseball Players Association.
