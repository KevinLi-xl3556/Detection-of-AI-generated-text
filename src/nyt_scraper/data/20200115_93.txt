Seal Beach, Calif.: Small-Town Ambience on the Orange County Coast
SEAL BEACH, Calif. — The recession of 2008 hit Colleen and Everett Butcher hard.
The couple were living in Apple Valley, Calif., a town on the edge of the Mojave Desert about 90 miles east of Los Angeles. Ms. Butcher, a real estate developer and property manager, was specializing in shopping-center developments, and as subprime mortgages imploded and the economy shrank, her projects turned to ghost towns.
