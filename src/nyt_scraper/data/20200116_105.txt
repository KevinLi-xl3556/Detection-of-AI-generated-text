Taliban Offer to Reduce Violence in Afghanistan Ahead of Deal With U.S.
KABUL, Afghanistan â€” The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with United States diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said on Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the American side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed  after President Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
